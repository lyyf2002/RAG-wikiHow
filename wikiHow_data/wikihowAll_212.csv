Learn something new every day.,
Learn to understand and speak Japanese.,
Use your imagination more often.,
Explore the big questions of life.,
Speak to people confidently.",How to Live Like an Anime Character1," Anime characters are always learning something new, whether it is a skill that they use to face a problem or a life lesson that changes them. Start being more open to knowledge when it is available. Read more often or search the Internet to learn about a topic you don’t know well.Learning a new skill or hobby is a great way to expand your abilities and have fun doing something you have never done.
Subscribe to a service that emails you a fun fact or interesting article each day so you don’t have to go out of your way to find new things.
Ask your friends, family, or strangers to tell you something interesting that they think you won’t know. Being curious is the best way to learn new things.;
, Anime characters often speak Japanese, so learning the language is one of the most direct ways to live like an anime character. Use a language-learning service, watch teaching videos, or simply get an English-Japanese dictionary and begin memorizing words.If you have the option in school or college, enroll in a Japanese class. Learning from a live teacher is often easier than learning alone.
If you watch Japanese language anime with subtitles, pay closer attention to pick up on words and phrases they use often. Write them down and double check their meanings by looking up translations online.

, Anime characters are always faced with difficult situations. They use their imagination to solve the problems creatively. Spend time daydreaming. Think of new ways to do the things you have always done one way. Write stories or try to make up new inventions.Using your imagination opens up unlimited creative potential, so you may start thinking or doing things you’ve never done before.
Imagination can be a fun way to pass the time, but it can also be a great way to solve practical problems. Use your imagination for both purposes. For example, daydream about what you would do on your perfect day. With chores, like washing the dishes, think of a new way to accomplish the task.

, Anime characters spend a lot of time thinking about and discussing common themes like love, death, and purpose. Be more like an anime character by spending more time exploring these enduring ideas. Read about them and talk with your friends to gather as many perspectives as you can.


If any of your favorite anime characters mention books, people, or other things that have inspired them, check to see if those are real things. If they are real, look into them and see why the characters like them so much.

, Anime characters are confident and unafraid to speak their mind. Learn how to speak up for yourself rather than keeping quiet when you are criticized. Carry on a conversation like you have something important to say. When people ask what you think, give your honest opinion rather than saying what they want to hear.

Dress in bold styles.,
Incorporate bright colors into your wardrobe.,
Experiment with makeup and hairstyles.",How to Live Like an Anime Character2," Anime is nothing if not flashy, so don’t be afraid to be more bold in the way you dress. Female anime characters often wear skirts and blouses that are unbuttoned at the throat. Guys often wear multiple layers, including a hoodie, or elaborate formal attire.


If you see an interesting outfit that you would normally be afraid to wear, buy it anyway and wear it knowing that you look good.
Take the look of one of your favorite characters and adapt it to fit what you like most. Overall, be confident about the outfits you choose.
Anime characters are not afraid to stand out for their crazy outfits. If it seems a little too outrageous, give it a try anyway.

, The worlds of most anime characters are filled with dazzling colors, so you can use them in your life, too. If you tend to stick with black, white, and grey, make a bold change in your wardrobe. You can even add some bright colors to your hair, like many anime characters have.


Use bright colors in other ways like painting your room in vivid colors, decorating with posters and objects that with bright colors, and buying sparkly school supplies.

, Adding makeup and a new hairstyle to your look can significantly change your appearance. Look at your favorite characters and try to achieve their look. Take a picture of your favorite character's hair to the salon and ask the stylist to cut it that way. Add elaborate eye makeup and bright lipstick, if appropriate, for a new look.


If you don’t typically wear makeup, this can be an exciting new step to take. Ask someone you know who is good at makeup to help you, or watch videos online that will teach you some easy techniques.
If you can’t cut your hair, try other ways of styling it. Braid your hair into long pigtails, spike it with gel, or put it into multiple ponytails.

Perform karaoke.,
Go outside and have adventures.,
Visit an onsen.,
Develop a cosplay of your favorite character.",How to Live Like an Anime Character3," A common tradition in Japanese culture, karaoke shows up frequently in anime. Find a friend with an old karaoke machine or a singing game on a game console and ask if they want to have a karaoke night. Find a local hangout that offers karaoke and sign up. Take a step out of your comfort zone and give it a try.


In Japanese culture, karaoke is often performed in a private room with friends rather than on a stage in front of strangers.

, Anime characters don’t usually sit inside staring at a TV. If you spend a lot of time inside, start going outside more. Explore the woods behind your house. Go walk around downtown and meet strangers. Book a camping trip, hike a mountain, or travel to a faraway place.


Adventures don’t have to be planned down to the minute. You could just start walking or driving and see where you end up. It’s about going into the unknown.

, Most anime character end up at an onsen, or hot spring bath, at some point in their travels. If you live in Japan, an onsen shouldn’t be hard to find. Other places may take more searching. Anything similar to a hot spring or public hot bath will work. In anime and Japanese culture, these baths often require nudity.


Outside of Japan, you may not find a traditional onsen bath, but you could visit other natural hot springs and at least have a similar experience.

, Find a local Comic-Con or anime convention and design a cosplay costume for your favorite character. Act out the character’s personality with the other people you meet. If you can’t find a convention, invite a bunch of friends over for a cosplay party and have games that incorporate the characters.


Cosplay for your next costume party or other events where you get to dress up like a character. Try out different versions of the same character if you have more than one opportunity.

Get Yato-inspired hair.,
Eye maintenance.,
Be lively and serious.,
Wear clothing similar to Yato's.,
Smile.,
Daydream about your wishes and desires.,
Be dedicated.,
Be hopeful.,
Be strong-willed, similar to being hopeful.,
Rely on others and be reliable yourself.,
Be protective.,
Be easy-going yet calm and composed.,
Maintain an SNS account.",How to Imitate Yato from Noragami," For Yato-inspired hair, go for long bangs of multiple lengths to partly cover your face. Make sure they don't give a messy look and also make sure they aren't a nuisance while you perform your day-to-day tasks. The bangs will need to suit the shape of your face. Blow-dry them regularly to keep them in shape.

If you have straight hair, then managing your Yato-inspired hair shouldn't be a problem but if you have wavier, curlier hair then make sure to straighten your hair using hair products or straighteners or consult your hairdresser for advice.;
, Ensure your eyes are clean, bright and look energetic. Apply casual eyeliner. If you desperately want to go for the Yato-look, then make your eyes appear more definite by using various makeup techniques. You can make your eyes bigger if wished, to make your eyes the defining feature of your face.

Yato is known for his beautiful, striking blue eyes. You could use a pair of light blue lenses to go with your look, essential if you're cosplaying.

, Facial expressions are important to consider if you're imitating Yato. Being a fan you know that Yato has two sides. Most of the time he appears charming, relaxed, goofy, easy-going and excitable but his darker side can take over at any instant. Express both sides at appropriate times. When times do not require you to be serious, then go with the flow and express your lively side but when it comes down to it, be serious, be mature and act dedicated just like Yato.

Watch the anime and read the manga with dedication to understand when and where you need to express both sides.

, In the initial chapters of the manga and throughout the anime, Yato is seen wearing a jersey, a scarf and a pair of knee-length boots. Later in the manga, he goes for a different look. He switches to a front-open jersey (which he sometimes wraps around his waist), a plain white t-shirt and knee-length boots. His hair is tied in the form of a short ponytail. It is up to you to decide which look you want to go for. If you don't have the the same clothes to dress up as Yato, then you can follow the general nature of his style. Dress in casual jerseys, keep your hair in good shape, wear knee-length boots and cover your neck with a scarf, for example. In a nutshell, the two styles are:

Straight, long uneven bangs followed by a jersey, a scarf and a pair of knee-length boots.
A short ponytail followed by a white t-shirt inside a front-open jersey and a pair of knee-length boots.

, The smile is one of Yato's best features. Yato is often seen smiling and goofing around when he is around his loved-ones. So, do the same. Make sure the ones who surround you are happy when it's time to enjoy. Be happy so long as your companions are!, Yato is always seen fantasizing about his desires which include having millions of worshippers, a shrine dedicated to his name, beautiful female Shinki (or Regalias, Sacred Treasures) and the affection of Hiyori Iki. He openly expresses his wants and needs so that the people that surround him get a good idea of his goals. So, proudly announce what your aim in life is and don't forget to give it your all in order to achieve it. Although Yato slacks off in the pursuit of his desires but with a little help from Yukine, he comes back on track., In the anime and in the manga, Yato is fully aware of his duty to gain enough money to build a shrine for himself (his biggest wish). For this purpose, he never leaves a call unattended or a request unanswered. He is always searching for ways to attain more money and grips any opportunity that might make him famous. So, whatever your aim in life is, go at it with all you've got. Avail all opportunities that might take you a step further on your path to success. Never give up hope!, Yato is cheery and optimistic. Even in the most hopeless of situations, he manages to find a source of hope and inspiration. This allows him to overcome all difficulties and gain success. All you need to do is have a source of inspiration. It is up to you what you pick. In case of Yato, it is the sense of affection, bonding and belonging, which he strongly feels towards Hiyori and Yukine., If circumstances shake your faith, change your path or make you rethink your goal, be strong. ""Where there is a will, there is a way."" is what you need to keep in mind while you adopt this trait. It was Yato's sheer will and determination which drove him to defeat Rabo and save Hiyori. So, don't let the regret of the past, the difficulties of the present nor the fear of the future deter your faith., Treat others as you'd want to be treated by them. If you show yourself as a reliable person, then others will automatically lend you a helping hand when you need it. Yato truly cares about the emotions of his loved ones. If they're sad, he tries to make them feel better. He tries to solve their expressed as well as unexpressed problems. In order to truly inculcate this trait in your personality, know everything about the people that surround you. Get a good idea about their interests, their strengths, their weaknesses, their dislikes etc. That way you will know how to make them feel better when they are feeling down., Whether it's your family, your friends or your colleagues, take care of them. If it's someone you admire, go to great lengths in order to protect them. Protection can be done both physically and mentally. Make sure they aren't harmed by anyone or anything and that their mental health doesn't deteriorate. Let them know that you will always be there to protect them and that they can rely on you in any situation., Most of the time Yato is seen goofing and joking around with his friends but when he's alone, he's calm and composed. Take a little time out everyday to rethink your strategies, mend your ways if necessary, let go of worries etc. This will help you remain calm and collected. Otherwise, you might appear stressed, tired or tense. Easy-going people like Yato live in the moment. Do ponder about events that happened in the past or things you want to happen in the future but keep them limited to yourself and make sure they don't appear overwhelming., If you have open access to the internet then make sure you have a means of communicating to your followers. They don't have to be a lot. Just make sure people who care about you hear from you often. Let them know about your current interests, your aims and aspirations etc. Yato has an account on the social networking site ""Tweeter"" as shown in the anime and manga. He often uses it to contact Hiyori and upload photos of himself."

Make cat noises.",How to Look Like a Cat (Neko)," Ears are the easiest way to start displaying a neko look. The cheapest commercial option is to buy a headband. Cat ear headbands can be found in various stores around Halloween but can also be ordered online or found in pop culture stores such as Hot Topic. You may also find cat ear hoodies that serve the same purpose., Making your own ears is a cheaper, more customizable option than shopping for the ears you want. Fluffy ears can be made from fabric. Draw an outline of the ears on paper. Make the ear shapes five inches (12.7 cm) across and three inches (7.62) upwards from the base. Hold the paper to the fabric and cut around it. Do the same to a pink fabric if you wish to color the inside of your neko ears.Cheaper, less work-intensive ears can be cut from a strong paper product such as cardboard or a birthday card or even wires. While many neko ears are furry in cosplay, they don’t have to be. Use your imagination., Attach the fabric together with pins as you work. To form the ears, first sew around the edge on the non-pink side, leaving the base open. Flip the ears inside out, then stuff them with a soft material such as feathers or cotton from a craft store. Pin the ears shut, then sew them shut.

, While the ears will look fine straight, for added effect you can make the ears curved like those of a real cat. Fold them so the sides of the pink lining contact each other. Find the flat end opposite the point of the ear. Pin it shut then sew it together.

, For these fuzzy ears, try using a hot glue gun to attach hairpins to the backs of your ears. Attach the pins to the side of your head so that the pink insides point outwards and away from you. Now you’ll have convincing, fuzzy ears.


You can customize your ears with ribbon, bells, glitter, and anything else you feel like using. Cosplaying is about your own unique look.

, A tail is a more pronounced way to state yourself as a catgirl or catboy. Tails will be harder to find than ears, but they may also be bought online or from a costume store. If you can find one, it’s a simple solution for those who want to start cosplaying without crafting. Search online or at costume stores.

, A way to make a fluffy tail from scratch is to make if from fabric. Get a furry fabric from a store near you. Cut two rectangles of fabric to the length you want your tail. 33 inches (83.82 cm) long and five inches (12.7 cm) wide makes for a nice, long tail. Lay one piece of fabric over the other. Pin it together. Sew all around the edges, leaving one short side open. Turn the tail inside out by grabbing the inside and pulling it out a little at a time.Cheaper, less fluffy tails can be made out of material such as tights. It is perfectly acceptable to use whatever you have on hand for your look.

, Unspool and straighten floral wire or a wire coat hanger. Without cutting the wire, lay it along the length of one end of the fabric and attach it with a hot glue gun. Roll up the fabric and wire, then spiral the wire around the outside of the tail to give it shape.


Thicker wire or fabric means you’ll need less material to stuff the tail, so be careful.

, Take your wire and fabric roll and push it into the tail. Do it a little at a time. The roll should fill the tail so that it keeps its shape. You can also use material such as cotton with or without the wire, but it will take you longer to fill the tail.


The tail should only be fully sewn shut if you are not planning on using the wire inside it to secure the tail to yourself.

, If you haven’t cut the wire free from the spool yet, you can use it to make a fastener. Try making a loop with the wire. Cut the wire using scissors or a wire cutter, then twist a second piece around the loop ends. This loop can hook onto the waistband of your pants or a belt.A pin is also an option if you don’t mind piercing your tail and clothing.
Another way to do this is to sew the tail onto an elastic headband or fabric belt. You may find these easier to adjust and slip off as needed.

, The cat eye technique is a common practice, but it’s perfect for when you want to look like a neko. All you need is liquid eyeliner. Felt-tipped eyeliner pens are simple to use and offer precision. Color the lash line on your top eyelid. When you reach the outermost corner, continue the line diagonally and outward past your eye., Make a second line from the end of your first to outline the wing. One way to do this is to draw it down towards the bottom lid line, but another way is to layer a second line the same way you did the original one and right next to it. Fill in any space between these lines.


The wing you make with the eyeliner can be as thick or thin as you desire. A thinner wing will give you a more subtle cat eye.

, Use a mascara brush to coat your top and bottom lashes. A couple coats of mascara serves to emphasize the eyeliner without the need to line your lower eye. While you can add eyeliner to your lower eye instead, it may overdo the look.

, Many cosplayers choose to emphasize their eyes with eyeshadow. You can choose a cream coloring and apply it under your brow on your upper lid, then put a dark shade such as brown on the crease, and finish with gold or purple on your eyelid. Use a brush to blur the lines and create a smokey look., Many cosplayers don’t use face paint when dressing as a neko, but it is still an option you can use to customize your design. Facepaint can be found anywhere, including party stores, costume shops, and dollar stores. It can be used to copy additional features of a cat, such as the nose, whiskers, or coloring, to make your cosplay stand out and feel even more cat-like.One way is to use an eyeliner pen. Color along the bottom of your nostrils. Make a line from your nose down to the center of your lips and add dots for whiskers.
If you want to look more catlike, draw a thin line down the center of your upper lip and lines out from the corners of your mouth. Use your eyeliner pencil to form a cat’s mouth.
If you have sensitive skin, stay away from cheap makeup unless it has mild or hypoallergenic written on the label.

, Your neko accessories and makeup can be worn with anything, but you may want to coordinate your clothing to match your ears. This can be done by wearing cat colors such as black and white. Anything that makes you look cute, such as a patterned top, a skirt, and black boots, will emphasize your look.

, When your hands are not otherwise occupied, practice making a paw. Keep your fingers together and bend them forward. Also bend your wrist a little. When your hand takes on this rounded shape, it looks like a paw and you can move it against your cheek in small circles to act like a cat.


Let your nails grow out a little to complete the paw.

, The Japanese sound for a cat meow is “nyan.” Practice pronouncing the “ny” together in one syllable. Keep your tongue near the roof of your mouth when doing this, and when you reach the “an” part, your mouth will open like a cat’s meow.


Use this sparingly for when you want to look cute, such as when you’re confused or when someone addresses you, or else you’ll wear it out.

Get her hair.,
Get her look.,
Get her jewelry.,
Be ferocious and fiery, but also calm and mature, sometimes.,
Try to be an early bird.,
Love animals.,
Try to be fit.",How to Imitate Princess Mononoke's Style," Still, don´t force yourself to dye or cut your hair if you don´t enjoy your look - that isn't the main factor. She has brown short hair, brown eyes with a grayish undertone, full, black lashes, and pale skin. It isn't recommended to look exactly like her - however, it looks best for you to make your hair look a bit tousled - this will add a more ""wolfish"" look to yourself. Comb it and wear it loose - and if it´s too hot for that, wear a ponytail. As for the eyes: if you want to, you can line your eyes with grey or brown eyeliner (as black is too heavy), so they seem a little more like the eyes of a wolf. Take care of your skin and keep great hygiene.;
, Princess Mononoke wears comfy, but also (kind of) girly clothes. Her dress and her T-Shirt are comfy and torn off, but also tight-fitting and feminine. The knee-length skirt gives her some kind of legroom, as the T-Shirt keeps her warm. Any colors (as long they are not too flashy or unnatural) are okay, but desired are deep blues, faded whites, and any shades of grey. For the shoes, just wear your favorite pair, and stay away from fancy sandals or high-heels. You have to wear something you are comfortable to walk or run with!

, Princess Mononoke wears big earrings, two armlets, and one headdress, as well as a necklace made of teeth and a crystal dagger held by a red string.

Goals.,
Have a target to aim for.,

Try to dress like Ippo and copy his hair style.

",How to Imitate Ippo from Hajime no Ippo," You might want to watch the anime for a greater insight into Ippo's character and personality. This can help you imitating Ippo as you will know Ippo's character more carefully and have a greater degree of knowledge about his personality.;
, Like Ippo, you should try to train hard and improve your body fitness. This includes training your lower and upper body, endurance, arms and chest. Try to achieve a body that Ippo has. Obviously somethings in animes are not realistic. Try to get six pack abs by training your stomach with sit ups, crunches, plank and other fat burning exercises. Do roadwork, meaning run to improve your stamina, do push ups for the arms and chest, squats for lower body and pull ups for upper body. Do circuit, aerobic and anaerobic training, mixing it up too for excellent results.

, Like Ippo, try to take up boxing and enjoy it. If you can't be a pro boxer, do it for a hobby. Not only will it improve your health, you're imitating Ippo as well. Try to use his moves in real situations in boxing, most of them are based on moves used by real boxers so there should not be a problem. Don't try to slack off, try to be the best and do your training everyday. It is important that you follow your coaches' instructions rather than doing boxing on your own.

, Do not fear anyone and be calm under pressure. Remember what you learned, and follow the gut theory.

, Set yourself goals and work hard at them - no matter what happens, you will have to accomplish your goals. Set harder targets each time and do not give up on them.

, Like Ippo, he succeeds because he has a person to beat. Make someone your training motivation, looking always to better that person no matter what happens, always taking on the competition proving to yourself that you're better then that person.

, For example, doing training at noon, relaxing in the morning and revising at night. In that routine, you could also add what foods to eat at what time. Try to be healthy with your selections if you can and do not completely take out fats from your routine. Eating good fats will benefit your body. Drink lots of water but not in excess and try to reduce your calorie intake and exercise more often to use up calories that you have stored from eating.

, Be a fun character but not over the top. Rather being serious all the time, be polite and kind around other people. However it is a must that you are serious over your routine.

First and most importantly, you MUST both train for classical ballet and have a given amount of seriousness about the profession.,
As mentioned before, Masumi trains extraordinarily hard in order to become a professional ballet dancer.,
Masumi humble, passionate, sweet, loving, and sort of perfectionistic/obsessive about her art.,
Next, it is also important to look like Masumi.,
Masumi is drawn with long, blonde, slightly layered/wavy hair and heavy bangs.,
Masumi is drawn in typical shojou style -- big saucer eyes, porcelain skin, and otherwise delicate features.,
As for clothing, Masumi's style is quite girly/feminine, but it is mostly pretty conservative.",How to Imitate Hijiri Masumi from Swan," This guide is mostly meant for those who already do this. If you wish to start ballet, make sure that you really want to and aren't just star-struck by the manga. Once you do start, work as hard as you can, like Masumi!;
, As long as you have the drive and the passion, you too can do this. Take as many classes as you can, audition for summer intensive programs in the like.


As difficult as this is to accept, there are some people which simply are not born with the physical capability to do well in ballet. If you are severely turned-in, have bad knees, or have pre-existing health problems, the pre-professional study of ballet may simply result in an excess of injuries and pain. It would be best to talk to your instructor to get an idea of your true potential, and to see whether or not it would be wise to dedicate so many years and loose many things, such as school and a real social life, to ballet.







, It would be helpful to exhibit similar qualities.

, Most of the dancers in SWAN are drawn with lithe, slim bodies and long legs. These proportions are ideal for ballet, however, do not try to develop unhealthy eating habits in order to attain them. SWAN is set in Japan, a country with a tradition of very sensible, healthy eating habits. Eating things like vegetables stir-fried in sauce, rice, lean proteins like fish and soy, green tea, and filling snacks like miso soup will ensure that you stay healthy and give you the important energy needed for your busy ballet schedule.

, She keeps her bangs down when she puts her hair in a bun, and often adds braids to her class hairstyle. However, it should be noted that most ballet schools do not like students to leave their bangs in their face when putting their hair up, as they can interfere with turning and partnering, and often get sweaty. If you wish to leave them down, and are allowed to, go ahead, but some might prefer to pin them back with a suitably girly hair clip instead.

, This look can be created by keeping your skin as clear and healthy as possible (see a dermatologist if necessary), and drawing attention to your eyes with mascara and eyeliner in colors like black, brown. or plum (whatever best suits your complexion).

, She often wears skinny jeans, cute sweaters with girly patterns on them, and simple sneakers or boots.


Masumi's aesthetic is the same regarding ballet gear -- she simply doesn't wear leotards with fancy crisscross straps. Nice leotards in solid colors are preferable, and will look more professional. Mirella and Bloch make fantastic ones. It would also be a good idea to invest in some nice warm ups, which Masumi wears a lot - she is drawn in track jackets, legwarmers, and skirts (Vol. 2), plus warmup overalls (Vol. 13). Track jackets can be found at American Apparel. Discount Dance has a nice selection of legwarmers and skirts. If you can afford them, warm-up overalls are also super comfy.

Be serious.,
Be intelligent and muscular.,
Be responsible and neat.,
Get your viewpoint across.,
Try to have hobbies that are beneficial to you overall such as reading as it improves your knowledge.,
Watch the anime and try to have hairstyle like Germany- Watching the anime will make your knowledge expand about Germany and try to copy his hairstyle.",How to Imitate Germany from Anime Series Hetalia," Germany does not like messing about and he doesn't appreciate humor. You should be only focusing on the task ahead and what you are doing at the moment and never drop your guard. To develop that, try doing your homework more often without getting distracted, this will help you become more serious. Also try to be focusing on your task rather than making your friends laugh. This is a good step to be less funny and more serious.;
, Germany is portrayed across as a muscular man who seems to know what to do. His intelligence level is very high so you should try to work out and become intelligent as well. To become intelligent, try to finish your homework and your course work. Also read books when you're not in school to gain further knowledge and improve your grades. Try to work out often and build muscle to become stronger. For that refer to other articles written on this topic. However eating a healthy diet takes no genius to work out that it is a foundation to becoming a stronger and healthier person.

, Manage your own time, become self sufficient. Don't let your mum tidy your room or let anyone else do your work for you, be responsible and neat. Try to be more organized into what you do such as putting books in a to z order. You must know what to do and how to make it easier not anyone else. Make organizing things and becoming self sufficient a habit, be a self manager, manage your own time and your own self.

, Do not be scared, if you think differently, say it. Express yourself more rather then being shy and cornered. Try to act less nervous and you could try to be happy when a hard challenge comes just like Germany.

, However also try to cook more and improve your cooking skills so you can cook cakes, biscuits etc.

, Try not to copy the clothes as they maybe too expensive to buy or you might end up embarrassing yourself.

Knowing how much time you spend watching Anime and how much time you spend doing other things can help you figure out whether or not you are really addicted.


Do you find yourself turning down your friends in order to watch Anime? Being introverted is not a bad thing, but ignoring your friends for the sake of watching Anime may cost you valuable friendships. If you find that you are choosing to watch Anime instead of spending time with your friends, you may be becoming addicted to Anime.Do you spend every free minute on Anime so that you sacrifice sleep, health, and hygiene? If you spend so much time watching Anime that you no longer bathe regularly or eat healthy (that box of Pocky seems so much easier to grab than cutting up an apple to eat), you may start to feel sluggish and tired, and you may find yourself getting sick more and more often.
Does Anime affect your school performance? Once you get home from school, do you start working on your homework, or do you start catching up on your favorite Anime show instead? Keeping your grades up is important; some colleges and jobs require a certain GPA.
Do you abandon other hobbies in favor of Anime? Did you used to enjoy soccer or playing the piano, but avoided continuing your lessons in order to watch Anime? If so, you may be addicted to Anime.;
, Are you spending so much money on Anime that you can no longer afford necessities, such as food, clothing, school supplies, or rent? Make a chart on a sheet of paper, and create sections, such as ""Anime,"" ""Food,"" ""Clothing,"" and ""School Supplies."" Each time you buy something from one of those categories, write down how much you spent. Write down how much money you have to spend, then look at how much you actually spend in each category.


If most of the items you buy come from the ""Anime"" category, you may be addicted.
If you find that you have to skip buying food, clothing, and other necessities in order to afford Anime merchandise, you most likely are addicted., If you can't tell if you are addicted to Anime or just simply really interested in it, try to remember how upset you were the last time you were unable to watch Anime. One of the signs of addiction is getting upset at not being able to fulfill your craving.If you got mad because you got grounded and had to miss an episode or the episode got delayed, then you may indeed be addicted. If the mere thought of not being able to watch Anime upsets you, then you most probably are addicted.

, Does your entire life revolve around Anime? If you really cannot tell, you may have to take a step back and try to see things from an outside point of view. Ask yourself these questions to determine just how emotionally attached you are to Anime:


Do you feel more attached/attracted to Anime characters than real people? There is nothing wrong with having a favorite character. It is only when you become so attached to a fictional character that you would reject all relationships with real people that it becomes unhealthy. A fictional character cannot give you the same love and attention that a real person might.
Have you ever gotten into a serious fight over an Anime? It is perfectly fine to disagree with someone or to discuss theories, so long as it is done in a mature fashion. However, if you find yourself so attached to an Anime that you become protective of it and lash out at anyone who dislikes it, you might be unhealthily-obsessed with it. Such behavior might even cost you friendships.

, Do you find yourself talking and acting like your favorite Anime characters or using too many Japanese words to be even more like them? Animes, much like cartoons, are often exaggerated; what may seem acceptable in an Anime or cartoon is often not acceptable in real life society. You may not mind being treated as a character in an Anime, but others might be offended if you treat them the way your favorite character might. Some people might find your behavior confusing or annoying, and they may treat you with less respect as a result.

, If you find yourself watching it for several hours almost every day, try this approach:


If you find yourself watching several episodes a week, or even a night, try to limit yourself to just one episode a night, or a few episodes a week.

, If you feel the urge to watch every single Anime show, try to fight that urge; some shows are several seasons long and a huge time commitment. Choose only one or two shows that really interest you and stick with them; you don't have to watch every single show in order to be an Anime fan.

, You can also try to take a break from Anime by not watching any Anime or reading any Manga for a certain period of time. Try it for a week, and see how you feel. You might surprise yourself by finding that you have discovered other hobbies and interests to fill up that void.

, Consider doing other, less-enjoyable tasks first before you settle down and watch some Anime. This will not only cut back on your addiction, but it will make watching that Anime all the more enjoyable. Here are some suggestions:


Don't watch Anime until you've gotten all your homework done—but also don't watch Anime past your bedtime. This will encourage you to not only get your work done faster but also to not procrastinate on it. If you don't get your nightly dose of Anime in, do not despair—there is always the next night.
Save Anime for the weekend. Your excitement and anticipation will build throughout the week—but you will also be able to get a ton of other things done during that week.
Do all of your chores first. Tell yourself that you won't watch the latest episode of your favorite show until you've done your chores (be it cleaning your room, folding the laundry, doing the dishes, etc). You'll get all your work done faster—and at the end of it, you'll get a nice reward.

, Do you find yourself purchasing Anime pins, action figures, bags, patches, and other items just for the sake of adding to your collection? Or do you buy those items because you really like them/need them? If you find that you are buying stuff just for the sake of adding to your collection, ask yourself these questions:


Do I really need it? A new bag with your favorite character may come in handy if you are shopping for school supplies, but you may not necessarily need that new Funko Pop figurine. If you are tight on money, try to buy stuff that you really need.
Do I like it? Instead of buying something just because it comes from your favorite Anime, try to pass on it and save up for something that you really, really like instead.
What will I do with it? Some items, such as mugs, watches, bags, and shirts are useful. Other items, such as figurines, patches, or pins serve only decorative purposes. You can manage your addiction by buying stuff that you will actually use (as oppose look at).

, Simply cutting back on watching Anime may not help your addiction. Visiting those fansites and further discussing your favorite shows will only cause you to think even more about Anime. You can help manage your addiction by not visiting those fansites anymore; not discussing your favorite shows will help prevent any temptation.

, It's perfectly normal to have strong feelings about the characters on your favorite show; it's and not something you need to feel embarrassed about. But when those strong feelings turn into a full-on love affair with a fictional character, it can be confusing, embarrassing, and frustrating to go through. Remind yourself that the Anime is just fiction—something made up by a group of writers and artists—and that it is not real. The worlds and characters cannot replace those around you.

, Sometimes, the only way to manage an addiction is to get rid of anything that reminds you of it. This does not mean that you have to sell or donate your entire collection of figurines, Mangas, shirts, bags, and so forth. However, consider donating or selling some of the items you no longer use and try not to buy new stuff to expand your collection.


If watching Anime online is too tempting and distracting you from your school work, consider either delete the video files from your computer, or deleting the websites from your browser's favorites.

, If you find yourself trying to mimic your favorite character or using too many Japanese words (which you know annoys other people), you may not be helping your addiction. Try to catch yourself doing this so that you can stop. If it has become a habit that you want to break, ask your friends to let you know whenever you mimic your favorite character or use a Japanese word unnecessarily.

, If attending multiple Anime conventions are a big part of your addiction, you may want to consider attending only one or two instead of the five or more that you usually do. Not only will this help you save some money, but it will also help you distance yourself even further from Anime.

, You don't have to spend all your time totally invested in one thing, even if you love it. Explore other interests and hobbies that you might have once enjoyed, but lost over time, as you became more and more into Anime. Here are some things you can try:


Martial arts. If you are into Anime and Japanese culture, you may be interested in martial arts, especially a Japanese one, such as Aikido or Judo.
Playing a musical instrument such as the guitar or piano.
Jogging, hiking, and biking can not only keep you fit and healthy, but they can also help you relax and enjoy the natural world around you.Knitting and crochet will keep your hands moving and busy; you won't have time to think about Anime.

, Sometimes, you can overcome your Anime addiction by giving yourself another, non-Anime fandom to focus on; this includes books, movies, and television shows. You may find yourself spending less time on Anime and more time on the new fandom. If you don't know where to look, consider asking friends or classmates for suggestions; tell them the sorts of things you like, such as horror, medieval fantasy, or vampire drama.


If you like to roleplay, then consider branching out to other, non-Anime related fandoms, such as ones based on books and movies.

, It will help you keep your mind off of Anime; it will also remind your friends that you still care about them. This way, the next time you really need someone to talk to, they will be more likely to be there to support you.


If you do not have any friends, try to find some new ones by joining a club at your school, going to a bookstore or library, or even hanging out at a park.

, Tell your friends and family that you want to overcome your Anime addiction. They may try to help you by not getting you any more Anime-related stuff for your birthday. If you have friends who are also interested in Anime, they may help out by not discussing it around you so much or introducing you to yet another Anime series.

Apply concealer and foundation.,
Add eye primer.,
Use eyeshadow.,
Accentuate with eye shimmer powder (optional).,
Create a pale outline of the inner eye.,
Make a longer outline with dark eyeliner.,
Put on black mascara.,
Wear false eyelashes (optional).",How to Get Anime Eyes1," Use these products to conceal dark circles under your eyes, and to give you an even skin tone base to work with. Select a foundation lighter than your skin tone.;
, Cover the area around your eyes with eye primer to keep your makeup in place and make the appearance more durable. Tap it on all the way up to your eyebrows, but not on top of them.

, Brush on eyeshadow around your eyes. While you may use any color, softer, lighter shades are recommended to accentuate the cute appearance of most female anime eyes. If you decide to use pale eyeshadow, blend in a tinge of brown over it to make it stand apart from the white eyeliner you'll be applying later.

, For a glittery effect, add eye shimmer powder around the inner corners of your eyes. This step can be skipped if you dislike the flashy effect, or if you do not have this product.

, Use white or pale eyeliner to draw a V shape through the tear duct area of your eyes, at the inner corner. Extend this outline slightly onto the waterline of each eye, but not more than 1/3 of the way across your eyelid. Paler outlines create the illusion of a larger object, and focusing on the inner corner makes your eyes appear closer together.


The waterline of an eyelid is the hairless area that touches the other eyelid when you close your eyes.
Some makeup brands make ""Big Eye"" eyeliner products specifically for this purpose.
You may use an eyeliner pencil or liquid eyeliner.

, Apply a black or very dark eyeliner to the top and bottom water lines of your eye, to make your eye more dramatic. Avoid the area with white eyeliner, or carefully outline the white area. On the outer eye corner, extend the eyeliner past the waterline by 1–2 centimeters (0.4–0.8 inches) to make your eye appear slightly larger. Optionally, create a small wing at the corner. Winged eyes look even larger and more dramatic, but large wings can result in a heavy, partially closed look that doesn't match most anime styles.


You might achieve a more natural effect by closing your eyes and using the natural crease to extend the outline.
Avoid smoky eyeliner, which can make your eyes look smaller.

, Use a ""volumizing"" and lengthening mascara to make your eye lashes full and long. The outer lashes often appear thicker than the inner ones in anime, so concentrate on these. There are two main approaches you can use to different effect. Choose between them below, but remember to let your mascara dry before applying the next coat:


Apply several coats thickly across the eyelashes for a bold, dramatic effect. This option is not recommended if you have a mascara that clumps together.
Apply one coat using three brush strokes, across the outer, middle, and inner sections of your lashes. Repeat as needed until you achieve the desired effect.

, If you are unsatisfied with the look so far, accentuate it with false eyelashes. Use demi lashes, or cut full-length lashes shorter before using. Apply them a little further back than you normally would to create a ""larger"" eye, across the top of the waterline or even just behind it. Optionally, add lower lashes as well.


If you do not want to use false eyelashes, curling your eyelashes can result in a similar, though less dramatic, effect.
Anime characters often have more ""separated"" eyelash look. Consider attaching sections of false eyelashes 2–4 millimeters (0.08–0.16 inches) apart, instead of in a continuous fringe.

Change your eye color with contacts.,
Use a light lipstick or lip gloss.,
Add a pink blush.,
Alter the look with colored eyeliner.,
Draw on false eyebrows.,
Tighten your eyes with teaspoons.",How to Get Anime Eyes2," Large ""circle lenses"" can achieve a more dramatic effect than makeup, especially if colored with an unnatural color. Always get your eyes measured by an optometrist first, and purchase the contacts from a reliable source. Poorly made or poorly fitting contacts can cause serious eye damage.


For an especially dramatic effect, try ""sclera lenses,"" which cover almost the entire visible eye.
Always put on contacts before applying mascara.

, Dark or bold lipstick will make your lips appear fuller and larger, which will detract attention from your eyes. On many face types, over-accentuated lips and eyes together can be overwhelming or chaotic. Consider a light pink lipstick or clear gloss instead.


You can, however, make an exaggerated heart-shaped bow on top of your lips, if you are imitating an anime character with this feature.

, The innocent look of most female anime characters can be reinforced with a light pink blush on the cheekbones. For a uniquely anime look, cross the blush over the bridge of the nose from cheekbone to cheekbone.

, Brightly colored purple, blue, green, or other eyeliners can achieve an even less realistic look. You may wish to use this instead of black eyeliner if you are imitating cyberpunk anime, or other unusual styles.

, A thinner, higher arch looks more animated than a natural eyebrow, especially if drawn boldly. Optionally, you can also use unusual colors.


Wiping a gluestick over your natural eyebrows will flatten them out to make this more convincing.

, Keep two teaspoons in the refrigerator or a cold cellar for 20-30 minutes. Put the bowl of the spoons over your eyes until the spoons have warmed up. This pulls the skin around your eyes tight, temporarily making you look wide-eyed.

Start shopping around and get clothes that are either unisex or follow the new trends; for example: get straight leg pants, button downs, cardigans but nothing too girly.,
Be androgynous.",How to Have the Personality of Haruhi Fujioka," Haruhi is always studying. See How to Get Straight ""A""s. She has a lot of common sense (which isn't very common at Ouran). Try to study and work hard in school, be sensible and do the right thing. Haruhi works hard in other things besides school, like housework. Try to work hard in both areas. This will show to others that you are smart and hard working.;
, Haruhi is the kind of girl who does things for herself. You can try to get things done by yourself such as cleaning your bedroom, doing your homework by yourself. This will show you are responsible and independent.

, Haruhi is smart but has no idea when someone is crushing on her. You can try to be oblivious by asking lots of questions, being innocent and unknowing.

, Haruhi can easily understand how somebody feels. You can be understanding by listening to others, understanding situations and seeing how somebody is feeling.

, Not ever, even if something happens to be funny to others; just watch them laugh and pretend to insult them under your breath. When something is surprising, pretend that you already knew about it.

, Haruhi isn't materialistic. She's really not girly in any way, she tries to save her money any way she can, like getting freebies from the store. Work hard for your money and save it.

, Haruhi has dark brown short hair that is about 2 inches (5.1 cm) long. In a pixie cut that is slightly wavy too. Get some pictures that show her hair and give it to a hairdresser. Dye your hair dark brown too. To achieve her wavy hair, put in those hair-curlers (large ones not small ones).

, Haruhi is more of a tomboyt than a girly-girl. Try purchasing baggy clothes that don't show off your figure too much. For example; baggy jeans, a long sleeve white t-shirt and sneakers. Don't wear make-up or wear too many hair accessories. Haruhi only wears about 2 clips on the side of her bangs.

, Preferably in shades of grey, blue, black and red.

, Haruhi can respond to he or she. It will take a lot of practice but with time it'll come naturally.

Figure out which ego you want to be like of Amu`s.,
Now that you have chosen the Ego and personality you want to have you need to act the part.,
Start to dress the part which you have chosen.,
Practice the talents that she/they have.,
Think about what your actions have been over the day, just like Amu is found to do in the show.,
Think about what Amu has in her room to reflect her personality.,
Amu has a crush on a boy in the same grade as her that lots of girls like but she acts as if she's not interested in him until he figures out that she has charas.,
Take time for yourself and hang out with your friends.,
Be yourself and enjoy life.",How to Emulate Amu Hinamori," In the very beginning of the series Amu was very shy and judged as a cool and spicy girl and she really wanted to change herself. Then there is Amulet Heart`s ego which is really happy upbeat and cheerful, also sporty. Amulet Spade is a very laid back personality and also mature, Miki is very into art and music. Then there is Amulet Clover who is most like a soft, gentle, kind,and bubbly type of person. She is very good at cooking and cleaning. The last three come from later in the series when Amu`s egg, Dia, hatched. Amulet Diamond is just more like a shining star and makes people happy around her.;
, Starting by changing the way you react to things is a good way to adjust. For example Amulet Heart would cheer a lot at a football game and Amulet Spade would cheer a little more quietly and maybe draw in a sketchbook.

, This is so you have the look. An Example is Amu Hinamori would have a half-up, half-down on-the-side ponytail (see Be a Pink Punk Girl). Amulet Heart would just have a side ponytail (see Be Sporty). Amulet Spade would have her hair bundled up in a hat (see Be Artsy Yet Sophisticated). Also Amulet Clover and Diamond would have double high ponytails (see Be a Girly Girl). One good way to reflect the characters ego you wish to imitate is to wear the colors they always have on. The Cool and Spicy look would have red, black, purple, deep/navy blue, and grey.

, This is a main and key point when trying to act like Amu Hinamori when ever she tries to help others out.

, The thing is it`s also good to keep a diary with you for this because it may be boring to lay on your bed for about 3-7 minutes.

, Put things like pictures of you and your friends in frames of on the wall.

, Amu also has a crush on a guy older than her by 5 years.

, Amu has tea parties in the royal garden with her friends and she's seen in several episodes going out shopping with her friends.

, Life is a lesson, don`t learn it trying to be someone you're not, because when it`s time to show who you really are you won`t know how. You won't know who to be. You will lose the person you were born as.

Drawing clothes for your character.,
Rejoice.",How to Design Your Own Anime Character," This is very important; if you start drawing then try to change from boy to girl, your girl would look very masculine or vice versa. In some cases, though, that is intentional. While designing, also keep in mind that some characters may be physically female or physically male but prefer different pronouns or identify as a different gender.;
, What era are they from? The 1600s, 3059? The era your character is from will play a big part in the clothing and behavior. Also, what is their personality? Is she a goth chic? Is he a rich kid? A hero/heroine? This will be very helpful if you decide early on.

, ""Clothes don't make the man"" - yeah right! Whoever said that must have never designed a character. A more fitting quote would be, in the words of Mark Twain, ""Clothes make the man. Naked people have little or no influence on society."" For this step you may want to use some clothing/ accessories magazines, or do some research online. For goth or emo characters, Hot Topic is good. For cutesy or bubbly, Modes4u.com or asiajam.com are fine. Really, though, you could use any magazine or website you want. You could also search by keyword. For example: if you wanted a maid character you could search ""maid uniforms"" in your search engine. Got a creative flair? Try designing your own outfits. Always sketch the outfits on a different piece of paper before actually putting it on you character.

, Here we are. All the prep work is done, and it's time to start drawing. This is where their personality comes into play. Here you will decide what pose to put him/her in. She could be licking a lollipop, or he could be holding a giant machine gun. She could be in her bikini laying on the beach. The possibilities are endless. But chances are if you have a goth or emo character, they won't be licking a lollipop or skipping in a field of daisies. So you may want to search up key words like ""emo poses"", ""aegyo poses"", you get the idea. You could always make up your own pose, but be sure to sketch it on another piece of paper to see what it would look like before deciding on it.

, Here's some advice. Layering clothes is always good. It gives that unique look. Basic clothes like a T-shirt and jeans would be good for a modest or introverted character who doesn't like to stand out, while vibrantly-colored or oddly-patterned clothes would be best for an excitable or flamboyant character. You could also consider certain unusual styles like steampunk, goth lolita, or Visual Kei instead of the typical goth or emo styles.

, You've finished designing your character! Don't forget to finish off their profile.

Get the clothes.,
Mind your hair.,
Piercings.,
Unless you've already got all those piercings, which you probably don't, you better off use fake, clipped-on piercing-rings, which look realistic, but do not demand having your flesh pierced nine times just for a cosplay.

,
Shin wears a belt-like (With spikes) choker on his neck.,
Work on the attitude.,
If you want, you can pick up your cell phone every here and there (It works the best if you just received a message), read and smirk, saying something about ""A client"".

,
Try to be especially well-spoken and courteous toward women, which Shin treats as potential (Or not potential) clients.,
If you actually play an electric guitar or a bass, you can carry it around.

",How to Cosplay Shin from Nana," Shin dresses either in quite extreme punk attire, such as bondage pants, leather and torn shirts, or in a uniform-ish, suit like outfit when he goes to work. He is most likely to wear combat boots or platform-sports.;
, Shin's hair is mid-length and spiked all up. In the anime it's dyed light blue, while in the live-action it's bleached. You may use hair wax or a very strong hair-gel or hair-spray to achieve this effect.

, Shin has quite many of them, as Komatsu Nana notes. However, the most noticeable piercing is Shin's sidelip, having a chain connecting between it and his lowest ear piercing. Except for that, he's got another regular pierce two helixes in his left ear, and one helix and three regular pierces in his right ear.

,, Either leather-like or PVC should work for this. If you can't find the exact thing, probably a studded choker would do. He also wears a two-lines studded bracelet. Go for leather-like and not PVC in that case. It will look better.

, Shin is well-spoken and courteous toward people other than his friends. Around his friends he allows himself to talk more freely, often mocking Nobu or acting more childishly. When it comes to his parents, he turns rather distant and avoids opening the topic.

,, This does not include Osaki Nana.

Go to Goodwill and buy two turtleneck sweaters in two different shades of gray; then, basically dissected them.,
Then, cut a light grey sweater's abdomen section and sew that on to the abdomen of the darker sweater at a slight angle.

,
Cut the sleeve of the lighter gray sweater off, cut it into a short sleeve, and then sew that sleeve onto the darker grey sweater (on the side that you cut the sleeve off of).

,
Finally, take the widest, thickest black twine or thread you could find and sew the stitches onto the shirt where the three sections of the shirt's torso meet, then hem each section with that same thread.,
Keep sewing until it looks like Stein's shirt.,
Buy a pair of white shoes, and draw stitches all over them with a black sharpie.,
Wear a pair of clear, no-frame/plastic-frame glasses, and draw black stitches in a huge semicircle around your right eye.,
Construct a headband with Stein's head screw; if you can, make the screw head spin and click by integrating metallic parts.

,
If you feel so inclined, you can decorate an office chair to look like Stein's, as well as design a death scythe out of old wrapping paper tubes.,
To get Stein's voice right it's best to watch the show multiple times through.,
Adopt Stein's mind-frame.",How to Cosplay Professor Stein from Soul Eater," Use a dark grey sweater, cut one sleeve into a short sleeve, and cut the other sleeve off.;
,,, Afterwards, sew the stitches onto the sleeves.

, Wear a pair of black pants, once the shirt is completed, to accompany it.

, Do not buy them from Milanoo.com. As other Cosplay articles explain, Milanoo offers lesser-quality items at nearly double the price. They most likely used to be good, but this isn't the case anymore.

, If you feel like this character adaptation is going to be a permanent part of your style, why not get the style tattooed onto you? You may want to wear olive green colour contacts and a pale foundation. Don't forget a silver wig with bangs to replicate his hairstyle. Don't forget to droop your eyes to being half closed or 1/4 closed. Stein does this himself.

,, Maybe metal if you know people who blacksmith as a hobby/career (they do exist).

, It's recommended to watch Soul Eater at least ten times through. After this, it's simply a matter of replication and training yourself. It's theoretically possible to replicate someone else's voice. Did you know most people who sing in metal bands had to learn to make their voices deep first? Same basic principle. The trick is to talk in complete and fluent sentences while doing it in a lowly voice. Kind of like you're bored of everything regardless of how happy you are. Maybe even sounding like you're overly tired from staying up all night. When you laugh try to make it sound like an ""eh-heh-heh-heh"", fully pronounced and like each ""eh"" and ""heh"" is a sigh out (make sure you still smile too so people don't think you're being rude). Finally, talk about science things. Stein specializes, based from the show, in one of History, Chemistry, and Biology. Based on this, take an interest in these., He is somewhat insane. Remember when he bashed his face to the screen, rapidly flailed his pupils around, and was laughing? Yeah. Don't do that. That's not healthy. However, you can adopt his mind-frame without excessive laughing and damaging your mind."

Have a dream.",How to Cosplay Zoro from One Piece," Zoro's normal outfit (pre-timeskip, which is how I'm writing this article) consists of a collarless white shirt with three buttons at the top (left unbuttoned), a large green sash, and black pants and shoes. Also, make sure to wear a black bandana around your left arm, but only wear it when fighting seriously.;
, Zoro's hair is one of his most defining features. A sea green color is best, cut into a short and sloppy style.

, If you can't do this step, don't even try. Zoro's three swords are his signature. Keep them at your sash at all times.

, Zoro has a crappy sense of direction. He can get lost even if he has a clearly drawn map from point A to point B, the road between being perfectly strait with a distance of 5 feet (1.5 m).

, Zoro doesn't care much for anything outside of food, sleep, and training. As long as his friends are safe, he'll let Luffy take care of things.

, Zoro, even without any real position, is one of the Straw Hat's most important members. A group of friends will make this more fun anyway (get a friend to cosplay Sanji and start a rivalry with him).

, Zoro cuts ships in half and lifts buildings. Obviously, you're more than likely not going to be strong enough to do that, but try some weightlifting to bulk up. Join a dojo or take Kendo classes to learn to use a sword (most places won't teach you how to wield three at a time, so you're on your own with that).

, Zoro trusts his friends and will protect them with his life, especially his captain. Stand up for your friends and help them when they need it.

, Regardless of who started it, finish it. It's a disgrace to run from a fight, even if you could be hurt. ""Scars on the back are a swordsman's shame.""

, Zoro wants to be the greatest swordsman in the world. Even if you don't want to do that, have some goal to work towards in life.

You can buy the coat online or you can make it yourself. Look at pictures of Soubi for reference. If you're not keen on sewing, you can always ask a family member or friend who is proficient in the skill to make it for you.;
, Soubi's hair isn't really a challenge to achieve unlike most anime/manga characters. If you already have long dusty blonde hair then you're all set! If not, you can choose either to bleach it dusty blonde or buy a wig.

,
Another common phrase for Sebastian is ' If I couldn't do something as simple as (Name the task you are referring to) Then what kind of butler would I be?

",How to Cosplay As Sebastian Michaelis on Kuroshitsuji," Sebastian wears an early 1900s butler uniform with a silver pocket-watch. The uniform mainly consists of a suit and tailcoat with a tie. White gloves are also part of the attire. These items are still around today so if you're looking for authenticity and the real deal, you can buy these online or some stores around. You can make them yourself too by looking at pictures of Sebastian for reference if you're wanting to perfect the details of his outfit.;
, You will also need to dye your hair black if it isn't already. If you're opting for a wig, you can find Sebastian's wig online at cosplay sites or buy one and cut/dye it yourself. There are many options.

, Preferably men's.

,, That is an important demonic trait that Sebastian holds.

,,,,,, Being clumsy won't work.

, Ever. Sebastian never lies but instead, takes advantage of when people don't specify exactly what they want done to merely humour himself when people get mad. He's slick.


For example, when Ciel tells Sebastian to find out who the Jack the Ripper suspects are, and they go through a whole bunch of crap for nothing, Ciel yells at him for not telling him that Jack the Ripper wasn't human and accuses him of lying. Sebastian didn't lie, but instead, didn't tell Ciel what he didn't ask for. This kind of thing is what you should do; don't tell/do what people don't ask for. You need specific details. Remember that.

, Especially black cats. Sebastian loves cats.

Purchase a wig.,
Consider making your costume.,
If you buy the costume, it comes with the brooch.,
The Makeup:


If you have breasts, you're going to want to wear either a minimizer bra or a chest binder.,
Use Kid's accent whenever you talk.,
Remember to hold your guns upside down.,
Extra things:


Fold the toilet paper tip into a triangle: it is the little things that count when it comes to Cosplay.",How to Cosplay Death the Kid," It can be from any cosplay website or maybe a costume shop near you. You may need to alter the wig and dye the bangs on one side to create the asymmetrical look Kid has. If you're already blessed with black, straight hair that curls at the ends, just use hair dye on one side. Do not use paper to do this; it looks incorrect and will lower the authenticity of your outfit. Hair extensions are also an option, but you will need to cut them and weave them in your hair. Dying would be the best option for if it's a hot day you won't need to wear a wig and it lasts longer!;
, Try to see if one of your friends can sew or if they know someone who does. You can try doing it yourself if you have the skill . You can chose to alter your current clothes if you have any that resemble Death the Kid's.You'll want a pair of shoes like kids which can easily be bought online. Most in-store, non-custom-made-cosplay shoes can make your costume look very peculiar so it's safe if you buy it; if you want to just buy them at a local store, Penny wafers may do the trick.

, If not, you will have to make it. If you do make it, its pretty simple: just draw the skull on paper or poster paper, cut it out, trace it on to gray or metallic silver fabric, cut two skulls, sew them together, and draw the face with sharpie. If you happen to have friends who are into blacksmithing, you can get the mould custom made and and ask them to smelt you the skull. This may be quite costly. The rings and guns are a pain to make by non-smithing means, so I suggest you just save yourself the time, effort, and frustration and buy them.

,
For the actual makeup, use a pale foundation if you don't have natural ivory skin, or if you already have ivory skin, you can use it if you want to hide a few blemishes you may have.
To give your eyes that sharp, comic-esque look, line them with a black eyeliner. Keep the lines thin but extremely dark, because you don't want panda eyes like L Lawliet from Death Note.
If you aren't lucky enough to have natural golden eyes, buy a pair of contact lenses in the golden-yellow-type colour. If there are none, scarcely, there are a few websites and stores that allow you to custom-make contact lenses.

, Practice saying Kid's lines in his voice when you watch Soul Eater. Kid talks in a complete, well-spoken way. Have frequent symmetry fits. This will give your Cosplay a hint of authenticity. Remember; Kid likes symmetry and anything asymmetrical irritates him.

, Kid holds his weapon-partners in this unusual way as his signature of uniqueness.

,
Make sure your house is perfectly symmetrical. The door doesn't have to be as most house architects do not make the door the centre-point of houses and this can't be helped, but you can make sure your desk is the centre of the room, your chair, your bed, two bedside tables, one symmetrical painting. Little things.
If you're in a situation where you have to sing at a karaoke bar, or you just want to belt out some tunes, try singing Resonance (Soul Eater theme) or Kid's theme (Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Have A Nice Dream)

,, Natsume is one of the students who is known to be genius, but does not boast about it. Natsume always keeps his mouth shut and speaks only to insult others or when talking to his best friend.

, Learn how to hide them. He usually does this to protect his friends. Be caring but never tell them that you really care.

Kenshin has red/orange hair which is pulled back into a ponytail.,
He has a sort of kimono-top, much like InuYasha's Cloak of The Fire Rat.,
He has white, baggy pants and a white obi belt.,
When choosing a katana, choose a plastic or foam one.,
His cheek-scar is in the shape of a cross with the vertical line fairly long (doesn't touch bottom of face, though) and the horizontal line short on the left side and longer on the right.,
Kenshin is a kind, calm, forgiving individual.",How to Cosplay As Kenshin Himura," The easiest way to tackle this is to use a red wig. Even if it's short, there are synthetic clip-on extensions that you can get online which make getting the wig a lot easier.;
, It's technically pink, though you could pass off a red (or even blue or black) one in the pink one's place. If you have an InuYasha cosplay already, just use the top for that, or you can either make it, go thrifting at Goodwill for something like it, or buy it online. Kenshin does have a white under-kimono thing, so keep it in consideration when making/buying the cosplay.

, Unfortunately, the odds of finding a white obi belt lying around are very slim, so either use one the color of your top (as the kimono-shirt doesn't close normally) or make one. For the pants, either have Lady Luck in your favor and find some or buy them. Light grey non-baggy pants work very well too (it's what I use).

, Foam katanas are very good because they can't hurt anyone and are great in cosplay fights and cosplay skits because no one runs the risk of having their eye poked out. Plastic katanas are very legit, but may break in cosplay fights and have sharp tips. If you aren't going to be in a cosplay skit, plastic katanas are cheap and good-looking.

, You can put it on with face paint, or if you're in a rush, washable marker.

, Though he used to be a Manslayer, he has put that behind him and gone on with his life. Even when he fights, he doesn't kill unless he absolutely has to. (If you know Inuyasha, Kenshin is exactly the opposite of him.) Though Kenshin is forgiving, he will protect those close to him.

, No one likes someone who has B.O.! That's just gross. Also, ask your parents to let you shave your armpits if you haven't already. It might be embarrassing but gorilla armpits are even more embarrassing.

, All of the Bishoujos like what they like and that's what makes them so unique! Whether its dance, the music business, anime, video games, rock climbing, painting, drawing, collecting perfumes or the mechanics of a car, you should be interesting in what you are interested in.

, You don't have to have the money for it, but take that tie on your robe and use it as a belt! Or, cut up some old winter gloves you can't use anymore into cufflinks/sweatbands. Things like this add detail to an outfit and are conversation pieces.

, Don't get stuck into the rhythm of, 'Well all the popular/beautiful people are always out there doing stuff! I don't want anyone to think I don't have a life!' Having a life is based on doing what you want to do. If you want to sit in your room and watch anime all day, do it! If you want to spend six hours at the pool, do that too but wear sunscreen.

, It's healthy and it's wonderful. Remember the scenes where the bishoujo comes into the dining room carrying some lovely tasting food that's organic and that they made themselves?

, While makeup can be good for looking good, in the long run it can drag your face down and make more wrinkles Plus if you save it for special occasions, people will be shocked and surprised when you show up looking your most beautiful.

, There will be rewards at the end of a long road. People are always impressed with the girl who looks beautiful but has a brain too. Stand up for the nerds and geeks and look beautiful but be smart!

, Different hairstyles suit different face shapes. Getting a suitable hairstyle will not only accentuate your beauty, but also make you more confident. Bishoujo, as popularized in Japanese anime, usually have long, flowing hair - if you are striving to be a bishoujo, you might want to try that. Re-bonding your hair and consulting a professional hairstylist will get you a step closer to achieving the ""bishoujo look"". For that Asian look, you might want to consider dyeing your hair natural black/dark brown.

, Japanese culture places great importance on cute-ness. Bishoujo are usually girls below university age, so dress up in a way that will make you look younger and cuter. A good idea would be to wear a sailor uniform, as bishoujo are usually shown in their uniforms in anime.

Lastly, whatever your motives are in life, make sure they are not tainted by a wish to do harm or gain personally over others.",How to Be Pure Hearted Like Goku," Conquest for power for the wrong reasons, money or addictions that at the end harm others directly or indirectly. Details of the things to get rid of need not to be listed here for they are written in your heart. Avoid what you know you must avoid. Goku never needed money to be happy. All the things he needed were added to him as long as he was still being who he was.;
, Appreciate all the people around you and if you happen to encounter in your journey anybody asking for help. Do not hesitate to help. This is what allowed Goku to have thousands of friends and knowledge from unknown rich people to the poor and wise and gain something as rare as the flying nimbus which he won by helping a turtle.Bulma refused to help

, Do your thing always smiling unless you see someone depressed or in need of help.

, Such as an ""infant"" or an ""animal"". Just focus on what you are doing at that moment and try not to think of anything radical from it. This will allow you not to worry about tomorrow, later, the past or make up in your mind negative scenarios.  Goku at every moment, except when his friends were killed, had his mind clear as water. When the evil man tried to find a single negative thought in Goku's mind, he found none and lost.

, Most of the characters in the DragonBall series were once enemies of Goku such as Piccolo and Vegeta. However at the end they became his best friends and in return his enemies made Goku's life much more meaningful and happy to the point of them risking their lives to save Goku. Goku saw something worth saving in them and he saved it. The enemy that once tortured and killed Goku like nobody else did in the series risked his life for Goku and even took care of his family many times.

, Listen to others regardless who they are or what they say. You may learn something or you may miss something important. Goku always was humble to everyone even though he was the strongest person in the universe. This allowed Goku to gain an enormous amount of friends all over the world.

, For example trying to be rich for yourself, abuse of your current status, etc. If your motives at the end are evil, get rid of them. Goku's motives and personality automatically allowed him to have all the things he needed such as love, money and health. Even though he was the strongest man in the universe at many points, he used that power only to protect others which allowed him to keep his body for eternity as a reward in the afterlife.

Adopt Ohana's personality.,
Stay optimistic.,
Stay strong.,
Be helpful, kind and selfless.,
Be independent.,
Overall, Ohana is a pretty great girl!",How to Be Like Ohana Matsumae from Hanasaku Iroha," Ohana has short, light-brown, curly hair. If you have short, curly hair in the same color of Ohana's, then great! But if you don't, don't worry about it. You can dye, perm, or do whatever you wish with your hair, but you don't need to go overboard to get hair that looks like Ohana's.;
, Ohana wears two daisy-flowers on either side of her head. It's cute - and something you can imitate! If you're not a flowery person, you can use hair ribbons, bows, different flowers, clips, and so forth. There's an endless possibility to what you can use.

, Ohana has lovely big anime eyes, right? If you would like to make your eyes seem bigger, then use eyeliner. Look over wikiHow on how to make your eyes look bigger. You can also buy contacts, but this isn't required.

, Ohana doesn't wear much make-up, if any at all, so try to keep it natural! If you must use make-up, then just simple things like lip-gloss, eye shadow, concealer where needed, eyeliner and such. But please don't cover yourself in make-up! Anime girls have perfect skin, it's how they're drawn and created. Perfect 100% skin is impossible in the real world. Just care for your skin as best as you possibly can.

, Shower daily, wash your hair every other day, use deodorants, perfumes, keep your nails clean and trimmed, shave your legs and armpits and such.

, Ohana wears a lot of yellow in the anime, such as her yellow scarf. Yellow is a good option if you want to dress more like Ohana.


Keep it simple. When you see her wearing her own clothes, you don't see her wear anything revealing or trashy. She mostly wears a blue hoodie.

, When she's going out, in trains, buses and such, she's wearing white headphones. You can buy some headphones if you like, but they're expensive, so try some cute earphones if you can't afford big headphones. Of course, plug it into your device, and enjoy the music!

, A big noticeable trait is that Ohana is energetic and bubbly, especially when she's with Ko and her friends. So, smile! When the going gets rough, don't bottle it up. Tell somebody you trust. Always think of happy thoughts!


A big part of Ohana's personality is that she's energetic. Try to be energetic, too.

, See the glass as half full, not half empty. Think positive!

, Look at everything Ohana's been through! Being forced to live on her own when her mom chooses to run away with one of her many boyfriends, and go live with a grandmother that doesn't think of her as her granddaughter. She runs into a girl scared of her, a girl who constantly tells her to die, and a seemingly pervert. And to top it all off, she's away from Ko, her best friend. To think that she could stay strong, optimistic and smiling through all that, really must be something! So try to be strong, no matter what life throws at you.

, Try practicing random acts of kindness. Focus on giving, and not taking.


A lot of Ohana's attempts to help backfire or are unappreciated. Remember, not everything you try to do will turn out right, or exactly the way you want it.

, Because Ohana's mother barely raised her, she did everything herself and became independent at a young age. Be your own best friend and rely on yourself.


This doesn't mean to drop all of your friends. Over the course of Hanasaku Iroha, Ohana slowly learns that you don't have to rely on yourself for absolutely everything and that it's okay to need help. It's okay to ask for help when you need it.

, But stay true to yourself. If this is not you then don't change to be like her, you'll just end up losing yourself.

Obsess over horror movies: Sunako loves to watch and admire her favorite horror movie characters.,
Appreciate anything strange: This includes anything out of the ordinary, anything scary, or anything Gothic.,
Hate the heat: Since Sunako is from Hokkaido, she hates the heat and sunlight.,
Stand your ground: Like Sunako, you need to be able to stand up for yourself and defend your friends.,
Be motivated: In the series, Sunako rarely ever gives up; once she decides to do something she will do it no matter what.,
Try to be a loner: Chances are if you’re Gothic you might not be with the ‘it’ crowd, since many of them are narrow minded.,
Dislike the chronically beautiful: Throughout the series the Gothic heroine detests how “radiant” Kyohei and the other bishounen in her aunt’s mansion are.,
Have some talents: It can be anything – art, writing, sports, acting, or whatever else you are good at.",How to Be Inspired by Sunako Nakahara's Dark Style," In the series she frequently brings up famous horror icons such as Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees. Start watching horror classics like 'Halloween', 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' and all of the 'Friday the 13th' movies. If horror bothers you, as well as gore, begin with PG-13 movies and go up to horribly gory R rated films like '28 Days Later' and ‘Dawn of the Dead’. Grow used to seeing people getting stalked and slashed in every film you rent.;
, You can find interest in many more things, not limited to this list: vampire bats, coffins, old and new horror movies, scary cult classics, Gothic art and architecture, cemeteries, ghosts, and everything else that seems eerie or darkly cool. Macabre is especially important if you want to be like Sunako Nakahara. Sunako adores the darkness, like scary abandoned houses and the possibility of seeing a spirit.

, Learn to appreciate the darkness, loving the night and shadowy, cool places. Complain about the summertime heat, or hot days.

, Sunako doesn’t allow anyone to push her around or make her feel poorly; she especially unleashes her fury when someone calls her an ‘ugly girl’, so don’t tolerate anyone picking on you or someone you care about.

, (Think back to Sunako making the kotatsu by hand and carrying it through the snow.) Thus, it’s important to strive for your goals to get what you want and always remain motivated.

, So, try to appreciate being a ‘loner’, or at least having time to be alone. Like Sunako, who often spends time with her skeleton and two figures in her room, find happiness in creating, thinking, or just being alone. It doesn’t mean you should forget about family and friends, but having some solitude makes you like Sunako and can be good to relax.

, Find beautiful people, like celebrities and models in magazines like Kate Moss and Giselle to be annoying and troubling to you. Think of them as too pretty to exist, therefore making them too difficult to look at.

, Nakahara is amazingly great at playing the piano, cooking the boys’ meals and is very strong. Make sure you can find some great talent to keep with you to not only impress but feel proud of being different.

Watch Hetalia.,
Declare your love for pasta.,
Be very friendly around everyone.,
Practice your painting and cooking skills.,
Act a bit emotional when the Holy Roman Empire is brought up.,
Act innocent.,
Be a hard worker, but don't refuse help from others.,
Be as optimistic as you can!,
Have fun!

",How to Be Italy from Hetalia," Focus on Italy - how he acts, what he says, and his interactions with other characters. This will give you a good idea of how to think and behave. Watching both the sub and the dub is best.


Read the webcomic, while you're at it. The webcomic came first, and there are many things in it that never appear in the anime.
Take a look at Italy's profile on the wiki for more information. The wiki covers events in both the webcomic and the anime.;
, Italy loves pasta more than anything. Whenever you see pasta will be served for lunch at school or you come across an Italian restaurant, get excited. Complain that the stuff that comes from a can isn't authentic and doesn't taste right. However, don't take this too far and insult someone's cooking. He does that in the show, but you shouldn't. You'll come across as rude.

, Italy is friendly to at least most people, so you should be as well. Don't take this too far, though. If you know people who act like the characters, treat them how Italy would treat the other countries! You know a Germany? Befriend them! However, if you know someone like Britain, don't run away from them. If anything, just act a bit shy around them. You don't want to be rude.

, Italy needs to know how to make pasta, right? Practice cooking until you can make tasty Italian dishes, including several different kinds of pasta. Get good at painting, too. You don't have to be an artistic genius. Just practice your painting and drawing skills and embrace them.

, If anyone asks you what's wrong, just say it's nothing an continue to act a bit glum. Don't take this too far, though. Don't bring a tissue box to History and cry your eyes out!

, In at least the English Sub, Italy is shown to be quite innocent. You don't need to be a saint, but don't curse or say rude things about people behind their backs! Italy wouldn't do that, now would he?

, Italy worked at Austria's place as a servant for quite some time, so he's obviously a hard worker. He always lets people help him and he always makes time for his friends, though, so don't push it!

, Think about the good things in life. If you do this incorrectly, you may end up acting like Romano, and that's not what you're here for! Italy never said anything negative about his past, did he?

Keep a smile on your face.",How to Be a Genki Girl," Many genki girls have flawless skin, and quite a few of them have extensive skin-care routines. While it's impossible for anyone to have flawless skin, especially in their teen years, follow good skin-care routines to keep your skin looking its best.


Everyone gets acne at some point, and you can choose whether or not to hide it. It's okay to not look picture-perfect every day, but do what makes you feel most comfortable.;
, Some genki girls have normal hair that they leave hanging down, and it can be curly, wavy, or straight. However, some style their hair in different ways, and some have hair that most people think must be dyed! You can choose to style your hair however you want, whether it's left down or dyed; however, make sure you wash your hair at the very least. If your hair is prone to tangling, make sure it doesn't tangle up, either, as that can result in knotted hair, which can be hard to fix!

, It might be confusing to know how this relates to being a genki girl, but genki girls have to be healthy - otherwise, they can't fulfill the genki part (since that's what the word ""genki"" translates to!). If your body isn't functioning at its best, it'll be hard to be so energetic, so eat fruits, vegetables, grains, and protein to get the nutrients you need.


Drink plenty of water. This will keep your body in top-notch shape, and will also help with keeping your skin clear.
It's okay to eat unhealthy foods once in awhile. Just do this in moderation. Your energy can't come from eating sugar all the time!

, It's very rare that you see a genki girl looking bad. Even when most people would be looking disheveled (for example, after having rolled out of bed in the morning), genki girls generally still look quite good, just a little bit more ""tousled"" than usual. Obviously, it's pretty hard to keep yourself looking good after an intense sports match or during your sleep, but do your best to at least look presentable, even if you are a tad messy.

, You don't need to be a fashion diva (unless you want to be, of course), but you should at least try to make your clothing look presentable. Wear clothing that's properly sized, don't force yourself to wear something you don't like or aren't comfortable in, and don't feel boxed in by constraints of normal fashion. If you want to wear something loud and flashy, that's your right!


That being said, in today's society, dressing in patterns that don't match or in a style that's not typical may cause people to make fun of you. You can either choose to wear something more conformist, or go all-out and not care what people think.
Be careful with taking ""loud and flashy"" literally. Some clothing exists that lights up or makes noise, but this doesn't mean it's appropriate for where you're going all the time.
Many genki girls would be considered cute, adorable, or some other term that would refer to a ""youthful innocence"". You can try modeling your style after this, but ultimately, how you dress is completely up to you.

, Genki girls are meant to be unique and not a whole lot of them stand out in terms of their appearance. Why not pick out something that's specific to you and you alone, to make yourself a unique, noticeable genki girl? Whether it's a specific hairstyle, a special accessory that isn't too common, or that same scarf with the wacky pattern that you've always secretly liked, finding something that's unique to you can bring you a step closer to being a recognizable genki girl.

, There are many types of genki girls all around anime and manga, and there's no way to act like every single one of them. There are the genki girls who go all-out and are noisy and energetic to no bounds, but there are also some more reserved genki girls who aren't nearly as loud and hyper (but still are quite happy and excitable). There's no way to emulate every genki girl out there, but there are general guidelines that you can follow in order to be a genki girl.


Don't mix up being a genki girl with being cheerful and optimistic. While genki girls are fairly cheerful, they need to have the extra energetic ""kick"" in their lifestyle to be considered a true genki girl.

, Quite a few genki girls are known for being unique and recognizable, and you should be unique, too! Develop your own style of dressing, talking, and behaving. Make yourself recognizable, so that people will know you and know that you're a genki girl.


You can also come up with a catchphrase, if you wish, since many genki girls (and anime characters in general) are known for having a catchphrase.

, Nobody recognizes a sad, negatively-thinking character as a genki girl, and being too harsh on everything will just drive people away from you. Stay positive and cheerful, even when it's hard. It's okay to have bad days, but they shouldn't completely dominate your feelings!



Be confident, too. Many characters who fit the archetype of being a genki girl are quite confident and have a ""we can do it"" attitude. They don't think they can do it, they know they can do it!

, Stress is unavoidable, but it's also important to have ways to manage it. Genki girls are excitable because of their natural bubbly personality, not because of their stress! If stress is a constant issue for you, it's important to find ways to deal with it so that it doesn't interfere with your cheerful, excitable genki nature.


If you're visibly stressed and others ask you about it, try saying something like, ""I've got ten tests today and I'm really not wanting to take them right now!"" with an air of cheerfulness to it. Be careful not to make it sound sarcastic, though!

, Genki girls are incredibly loyal friends, and often tend to make everyone else laugh and feel good. (In fact, that's one of the things that they tend to enjoy doing!) Do random acts of kindness for your friends (and even strangers), do your best to stay out of fights and arguments, and show your eagerness when your friends join you (such as by waving your arms or jumping up and down).


If you're in a romantic relationship, that's great, but remember not to abandon your friends and family for your partner. Genki girls are loyal to their friends and family first. (But don't completely ignore your partner, either!)
Some girls don't have the best families or home life, and/or have bad friends. If this is the case with you, be cautious. You don't need to be blindly loyal to people who you dislike or who mistreat you just because this article said to be loyal.

, Not just in terms of walking, but in terms of life, too! Since genki girls are known for being energetic, do everything a little faster than you normally would, whether it's walking, speaking, or completing tasks. Make it look like you're always eager to get to the next task in the day.


Of course, don't rush tasks that require precision or may affect you in the long-term. You might think it fits your genki girl nature to study quickly, but you'll regret that decision when you get your test back and find out that you got a bad grade.

, While a comical quirk of genki girls is to run everywhere and swing their arms around wildly while doing so, you obviously don't need to take it to that extreme. However, being a little extra bouncy and animated in your movements is a great touch. Wave your arms around when talking, bounce up and down on your feet, put an extra spring in your step - the choice of how you display your energy is yours.

, A noticeable trait of genki girls is to speak louder than others do. Make sure not to shout, though! Just raising your voice slightly is fine. If you shout, you're likely to annoy people (and possibly hurt their ears).

, If your aim is to be loud and energetic, you'll want to make sure that people want to hear what you have to say, right? Developing a good sense of humor, and possibly a sense of wit, can make others much more interested in what you want to say - and keep in mind that being funny is a common trait of genki girls, too.

, Genki girls are known for being hyperactive, happy, and excitable, so if you currently feel the opposite of that, let it show. People who know you as being so cheerful and energetic will notice your change in pace and tone, and will take it seriously.


Obviously, if you never feel like being energetic, then this won't do much. You might be better off emulating another anime character archetype that doesn't require you to be so noisy.

, There are times when being hyperactive or loud just isn't appropriate for the situation. Being a genki girl isn't about being disruptive or disrespectful, so show respect when you need to and keep quiet when it's best for you to do so.


Avoid disrupting people at times when they're trying to focus (e.g. at school or work), or when they're trying to talk to people about something. This isn't funny to them, and it can even get you kicked out of public places.
Generally, if you think behaving in your genki nature in the scenario would make people upset or angry with you, don't do it.

, You don't have to be happy all of the time - but having a smile on your face is a nice touch, whether or not you're a genki girl. It'll draw people towards you and let you know that being cheerful is one of your best aspects. That's the best part of being a genki girl.

Learn about anime.,
Find a series (or 3).,
Invest in anime/manga.,
Think about renting or borrowing.,
Join an online Community.,
Expand your interests.",How to Be an Anime Fan on a Tight Budget," Before you even buy your first anime DVD or Volume of manga, do some research (if you haven't already) - the different Genres, the history, terminology, notable titles, etc. Doing research will make sure that 1) you know what you want to buy, and 2) nothing will surprise you. Wikipedia is a good start.;
, After you've identified what genre you are interested in, find a few series to start with and then research them - characters, plot (be careful about spoilers), author, etc. Make sure the title is something you like before you buy it. The easiest way to find a series you might be interested in is to simply Google or wiki search ""(insert anime genre here) anime series"" - at least some of the results you get should be anime series.

, This will serve as your first actual step into anime fandom. Once you've found a series to get, go out and buy the first volume or DVD. Do not go and buy every volume or DVD of a series until you know you like it - otherwise you just end up wasting $90-$100. It is a good idea to check YouTube first for the episode videos to see if you like it. Two of the easiest places to find Anime and Manga are Borders (for manga - $7.95-$9.95 a volume) and Suncoast Movies ($19.99-$26.99 each).

, If you like to try different types of anime without spending too much money on it, try visiting the library. They often carry some well-known manga that you can check out for free. If you're looking for more variety, renting anime online is also pretty inexpensive (usually costing about $5-$20 per month, depending on the service/plan).

, Now it is time to talk to your fellow fans. There are several anime communities out on the net, both general anime (Gaia online) and series specific. These sites are often free to join, requiring only an email, and often have a large amount of free media content (Gaia online has entire episodes of some anime series online) These sites also give you a chance to talk to fans of other series - and fans of yours. This is why joining a community is listed after buying into a series - it gives you something to build off of. When you get to the online community, you'll actually be able to contribute to discussions.

, Start using the online communities as a stepping stone to other series. General anime sites will often have discussions topics about a series in general the starts with an overview of the series.

",How to Appear Yandere," This is very important, since this will be the person you will go yandere for. You can either choose someone you are in love with, or someone you feel you can appear to be in love with. It doesn't even have to be a love, really. It could be a sibling or a friend. It's just love that's the most famous yandere-type.;
, If it's someone you don't hang around with that often, you could stare at them smiling, creepily. You could begin talking to that person after a few days. If it's someone around you, you could still act a bit odd (like staring more than often, gazing into their eyes while they are talking) and talk to them more often.

, Note down things about them and follow them everywhere. But don't be seen!

, First things first, you should seem adorable. Act like the ideal, cute and kind girlfriend/sister/brother/friend, etc. Giggle, show lots of care and tilt your head. Play with your hair and bite your lip, gently!

, Every time your beloved hangs out with someone else besides you, give them the death glare! Your logic through this whole thing should be: Why would they ever need anyone else but me? Try having them all for yourself.

, Now, this is a daring step but if you really want to be a yandere, you need to get more violent. Gently threaten people to make them leave your beloved. Act more creepy, like if you're cutting vegetables then suddenly stop and look at the knife, asking the beloved something like, ""You do love me, right?"" or ""We're friends, aren't we?"", trying to make them uncomfortable. Start questioning things straight out.

, You didn't mean for anyone to find it, now did you? Remember it's not bad to get in trouble sometimes! 

, You do want to appear as the ideal wife, so cook for them and do anything to get their approval. Respect them.

Choose a target who will be comfortable with your advances.,
Be the target's biggest fan.,
Protect the target from inappropriate advances.,
Show deference to the target.,
Act on your cuteness aggression within reason.",How to Act Yandere Without Being Weird1," The target of your yandere love should be someone who struck you immediately as impressive. The kind of person you could really devote yourself to. Common targets include captains of sports teams, people who just moved to the area (Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni), and up and coming leaders (Code Geass).Your target should come across as the leading player in their own life-adventure. In a manner of speaking, they should be the hero of their own story... and yours as well.
Your target's talents and skills should be something you respect or admire. This way, your adoration of them will be genuinely intense.
Choose someone who is willing to receive your over-the-top advances. You should never make them uncomfortable. Pick someone who likes silly games, and already knows you well.;
, Attend the target's games, practices, and recitals. Be a one person cheering squad. Hand the target of your love a bottle of water when they step off the field or trot off the stage. Let them know how devoted you are.Talk with friends and classmates about the target's game-changing plays or virtuoso level piano performances.

, You've devoted yourself, heart and soul, to the target, so it's only fair the target reciprocates. Save up a Death Star grade stare-down for when others try to get fresh with the target of your love. Scold the target for leading on others when they're obviously not meant to be together.


Yandere types often act violently jealous when the target of their love is violated by the affection of an outsider. This, however, is not acceptable in the real world. Only ""protect"" the target in a playful, fun-poking way., Allow the target to choose the locations where you plan to meet, the movies you see together, and the snack shops you visit during your free time. Do what the target asks of you. Show respect for the target's wishes and goals.


The target will read your easygoing and agreeable ways as being in harmony with their own. This will draw them deeper into the complex web of your love, where they'll never, ever escape.

, Cuteness aggression is where something is so cute or you love something so much you want to do it harm, as in ""You're so cute I could squish you!""It's only natural when you see the target you feel a little frisky.


Give the target a good bear hug, a gentle and friendly punch on the arm, or a poke on the shoulder. Scrunch your eyes closed as you do so and make a cutesy noise. Let them know you think they're so cute, you can't help yourself.
Throw light, safe objects at the target, like gloves, scarves, and paper at the target. Shriek with joy as you do so, saying something like, ""You're so cute, I can't stand it!""

Convey an air of innocence.,
Add cute accessories.,
Wear soothing colors.",How to Act Yandere Without Being Weird2," Women should dress in conservative skirts and dresses. Men should prioritize a clean-cut look, wearing things like khakis, plain dress shirts, and school uniforms. Keep your style simple. Yandere is something you feel in the heart while appearing normal on the outside.Keep your hairstyle simple. Avoid showy or edgy cuts. A yandere is pretty unassuming aside from the erratic, volatile love they have for the target of their affection., Women can tie bows in their hair, like you could around a ponytail. Guys might consider wearing a pair a glasses. Non-prescription ones can be used if you have perfect vision.


A simple watch, necklace, or bracelet can add some uniqueness to your yandere outfit. Avoid being too over the top or flashy with accessories. The worthiness of your love should win the target over... or else., Green, blue, and violet have a natural calming effect that you can use to your advantage.Although the fires of yandere might burn scorchingly hot in your heart, the colors of your wardrobe will say, ""Pick me -- I'm sane!""


Earth tones, like browns and greens, can also give the impression of stability and have a soothing effect."
"
Cue your beast mode.,
Convey your moods with clear facial expressions.,
Master your yandere laugh.",How to Act Yandere Without Being Weird3," Yandere characters usually have a special look they use to cue when they're about to go on the rampage. Oftentimes this is a somewhat creepy expression, represented in animation by a shadow cast over the face. When people are interfering with you and your target, glare at them through your eyelashes to imitate this.


When someone is edging in on the target of a yandere individual's love, another common reaction is to open their eyes wide with an expression that might be described as ""menacingly shocked.""A twitching eye or mouth can be just the thing to show you're about to blow your top. When you feel your inner beast stir, let a twitch signal your feelings to the rest of the world.
Avoid doing this around people who aren't in on the joke, as you may scare them.

, Be expressive with your face. Show the target of your love clearly how you feel with smiles, wistful looks, and lovelorn glances. Oppositely, when things get romantically rocky or someone butts in on you and the target, let your features reflect your disapproval.Although expressiveness is a common feature recognized in yandere, this may be due to the fact that Japanese animation and manga, which are often very expressive, are the most common mediums in which the yandere archetype occurs.

, Use your phone or an audio recorder to take a sound clip of your laugh. Listen to it. Your laugh should be cute but with an underlying edge. Adjust your laugh little by little, using the recorder to check the changes you have made. Do this until your yandere laugh is second nature.


Changing a natural reflex, like laughter, can be difficult. It may take a while and some trial and error before you get the laugh up to yandere standards.

Decide what your Sailor Scout name will be.,
Decide your RoI (Realm of Influence).,
Create your powers and attacks!,
Start with creating a basic (signature) attack.,
Create a stronger attack.,
Create yet ANOTHER attack!,
Choose what magical objects you will have.,
Create your signature pose!",How to Be a Sailor Scout1," Try not to choose one that already exists, for example, don't be Sailor Jupiter. If you haven't seen the whole anime or read the whole manga yet, do some research to make sure this Sailor Scout does not already exist.


Be creative! Sailor Scouts aren't just planets. Try naming yours after a star, moon, or constellation! You could even be Sailor Milky Way!
If trying to make a Sailor Earth or Sailor Sun, be careful. First of all, those are both very important parts of the solar system and naming yourself after them would make you seem a bit self-centered. Plus, there is a theory that Tuxedo Mask is actually Sailor Earth, so...;
, This is one of the most important parts. This determines what kind of powers you will have. For example, Sailor Mars's RoI is fire, and she has fire-based attacks, and the same goes for Sailor Mercury with water. Their RoI are very obvious, but you may have to do some thinking with yours, as the main ones are already taken.


Make your powers and attacks based of your RoI.
Yes, it IS possible to have more than one RoI, as long as they are not big, major things like Mercury and Mars's. And if you do have two, then it is probably possible for you to have the same one as an existing Sailor Scout.

, Be inspired by the powers and attacks the Sailor Scouts have on the show. Make them have something to do with your RoI (Realm of Influence).

, This should be something small that can weaken, confuse, slightly hurt or harm, distract, or intimidate the enemy.


Decide what you will say and do while preforming this basic attack. What you say will have to have something to do with the actual attack, and what you do whilst preforming it should be cool and intimidating and reflect your personality. It can also be based on or inspired by your signature pose (see below). Think of Sailor Venus, who has ideal attack choreography. It's inspired by her signature pose and is simple to do and remember.
What you say in your basic attack will usually be two words long. Ex. ""Bubble Spray!"" or ""Supreme Thunder!""

,


This should be a three-word attack based off of your normal attack.
It should be powerful, but not so powerful it can defeat monsters (unless combined with your fellow Sailor Scout's powerful attacks at the same time, then there is a chance).
Have fun and be creative with this part!

,


This one should be strong, but not as strong as the last one.
Make this one really cool!
Unlike the others, this does not have to have a connection between them. It can be a complete different attack style, as long as it still fits in your RoI.

, Will you transform with a pin, brooch, or some other object? You must choose. You could even be creative and invent something entirely new that lets you transform!


Unless you are the leader of your region's gang of Sailor Scouts, don't have too many items or make them too powerful. Usagi (Sailor Moon) has many magical objects, and she is almost always the one to finish off the episode's antagonist. But remember, she is the leader. She also doesn't really have a ""true"" attack/power. She just has a bunch of cool magic stuff.
You can copy what other Sailor Scouts have, like Usagi's transformation pin or Ami's supercomputer, or make up your own.
Some of your magical objects may have a special attack that goes with them. Remember that when creating them!
When using a magical object, you must say something for it to work. Make up something cool to say while using it. They are usually three words.

, This may not seem that important, but it is. Sailor Moon's signature pose is iconic. Try to make yours creative and simple like that.


This part can actually be rather fun, because you test these in real life over and over again! Remember, inspiration can come out of nowhere!
Your signature pose is what will define you as a Sailor Scout. When you transform or show up with your Sailor Scout friends for battle, this is the pose you will demonstrate. So make is great! This can inspire or be inspired by your signature attack (see above).

The story begins when Shinichi and Mouri, Ran (his love interest) go on a date to an amusement park. While at the amusement park, Shinichi inevitably gets caught up in solving a criminal case, which involves a dangerous criminal organization known as the Black Organization. Shinichi gets caught spying on one of the members and is therefore knocked out and forced to swallow an experimental drug. Instead of dying, Shinichi is reverted to his old grade school self, unbeknownst to the Black Organization and his family and friends. Shinichi decides that he must keep his new identity a secret in order to protect his family and friends and only reveals his identity to certain people, including Agasa, Hiroshi. Ran comes close to identifying Shinichi in his old body so Shinichi comes up with the alias Edogawa, Conan, based off of two famous detective novelists. Agasa assists Conan by creating his signature gadgets: A voice changing bowtie and a watch that fires anesthetic needles.

Yep, they can get as bizarre as pairing bad guys with good guys! But I won't spoil anything for newbies! Although, the first romantic feelings that we come to know are between the two main protagonists, Shinichi and Ran! Although, like some other people we meet later on, they're pretty smart when it comes to seeing other people's romantic feelings, but pretty dumb when it comes to how they feel about each other!

, Magic Kaito occurs quite frequently throughout the series! One of the main favorites of the Detective Conan show, who is actually the main character of the ""Magic Kaito"" show/manga, is Kaito KID, the elusive thief though sometimes to be the modern day Arsene Lupin, just as Shinichi is referred to as the modern day Holmes! Other characters from the show, without giving away anything, that appear in Detective Conan, are police officer Ginzo Nakamori/ Mace Fuller, his daughter Aoko Nakamori (heehee), teenage detective Hakuba Saguru, two appearances by classmate Akako (she's got a BIG secret!), and one appearance by Aoko's friend Keiko. In OVA 1, most of the cast of Yaiba, including antagonists, appear, along with Conan, Ran, Kogoro, the Detective Boys, and...KAITO KIDDD!

Be Pretty.,
Brush your teeth thrice, wash your face twice, shower once.,
Use lotion and sunscreen.,
Have beautiful hair!,
Draw your symbol on your forehead.,
Create your magical objects.,
Be strong and athletic.",How to Be a Sailor Scout2," Don't take this the wrong way - everyone is beautiful in their own special way. But being anime schoolgirl levels of pretty... totally different.


Make sure to shave your legs! The Sailor Scouts wear short skirts, first of all. Plus, they're teenage girls. And they're supposed to be really pretty. Smooth legs are a must!

,


Brush your teeth after breakfast, lunch, and dinner, to keep them looking nice and your breath smelling fresh. Can you imagine being the only Sailor Scout with a cavity? Yuck!
Wash your face twice a day! Try a pore scrub to clean your pores to help you keep from breaking out. Do some experimenting to see what face washes work best for you. You could even use a combination of more than face wash! And if you can, moisturize your face daily. Also avoid touching your face, which, as you probably already know, can cause you to break out.
Shower once a day. Make sure you shave your legs every day and wash your hair! Also, use deodorant as soon as you get out of the shower. And remember, boiling hot water isn't good for your skin. Plus, it wastes the hot water in your house. Instead, take medium-length, warm showers. Or even cold showers if you want! Cold water can actually make your hair shiny, like Rei Hino.

, The Sailor Scouts are beautiful, and you should use lotion and sunscreen to make sure you don't get irritating sunburns.


The lotion will make your skin smooth, and feel nice. It also moisturizes it.
Speaking of which, drink a lot of water. It actually moisturizes your skin (as well as keeping you hydrated, healthy, and happy)!

, All the Sailor Scouts are known for their beautiful and unique hairstyles. They are a big part of who they are, and reflect each of their individual personalities. Sailor Moon's hairstyle is iconic! Make your hairstyle like that. Don't drastically change your hair, though. You are simply giving yourself a Sailor Scout makeover, not changing who you are.


Try not to blow-dry your hair much. Instead, just let it air-dry.
Know how to take good care of your hair.
Many Sailor Scouts have long hair, but not all of them do. If you want to grow out your hair for this look, go for it! But don't neglect to get it trimmed- trimming it can actually make it prettier, and grow faster. Get a Sailor Scout outfit!
You can order one online, but the ones you find on the internet will probably be from canon Sailor Scouts. You need your own unique outfit!
You could try making one yourself. First, design your outfit, and try to keep it simple and similar to the other Sailor Scout's outfits. Choose a unique color scheme, and start making it!
For more information, see an article about making a Sailor Scout outfit.

,


Your parents may not want you to do this. Make sure you get their permission first!
When you create your symbol, make it creative, easy to remember, and simple to draw, and still along the lines of the other Sailor Scout's symbols.
Make sure you do it in marker that will come off easily!

,


Do a drawing of all your magical objects, from your transformation wand to your moon scepter to your communicator watch and everything in between!
After you've finished the drawing, begin creating. You can probably find moon tiaras and moon scepters and such online. But be creative, customize stuff you find around your house! If you do find something from the internet, and your thing is like a re-colored version of it, just get a cheap one and spray paint it to get the right colors.
Look up articles on how to make the items you need. If you can't find anything and have absolutely no idea how to make them, try finding something off of Etsy or asking someone else to make it for you.

, The Sailor Scouts need to be strong and athletic! You are no exception! You must train and train hard! After all, how else would you defeat monsters?


If you are not in shape, get in shape right now. The Sailor Scouts are all fairly skinny and fairly athletic. You want to be one of them, right?
Pay extra-special attention in P.E. and even health class. You need to learn how to play sports and be strong! Practice as much as you can, and pick up some cool sporty skills you can impress people with along the way. You'll be thankful you did!
Consider taking gymnastics lessons. These will teach you a lot about being a Sailor Scout, as well as other important things. Best of all, it's a fun and ""girly"" way to become strong and athletic!

Be nice.,
But don't let that stop you from being assertive!,
Be cool, and show people who's in charge.,
Be romantic.,
Be brave.,
Don't flat-out tell anyone you're a Sailor Scout.,
Embrace your new identity!

",How to Be a Sailor Scout3," The Sailor Scouts are actually pretty nice, all of them. Even Rei Hino would do anything to help out her friends. Be nice to everyone you meet, and be especially kind to your friends. Also be very kind to animals and nature.

, Don't be a bystander If someone is being bullied or picked on, go help them, and don't be afraid to yell at the bully! It's what the Sailor Scouts would do. Don't beat them up, however. That's NOT what a Sailor Scout would do.

, Don't be mean and/or boss people around too much. People see the Sailor Scouts as natural leaders. And they are! Make yourself a natural leader too. After all, you just might end up being a moon princess!


Don't let people boss you around! Show them who's boss! Ask yourself, ""What Would A Sailor Scout Do?""

, Almost all of the Sailor Scouts have a crush on someone, and many of them can come off as a bit boy-crazy sometimes, especially Usagi.


If you think you might have a crush on some, don't just ignore it! Daydream and talk about him, even take it a step further and ask the guy out. Come on, don't be scared. If you're a teenager, you could even end up being this dude's legit girlfriend!
But whatever you do, DON'T try to make yourself like someone. It just doesn't work that way. Love can be made, but true love is born, not made.

, It must take a LOT of bravery to fight scary monsters like that all the time! Don't you think so too? To be a good Sailor Scout, there is definitely going to be a lot of bravery involved. Can you make yourself braver? Well, here's an idea- if you're a Harry Potter fan, and in a scary situation, to act braver, just say ""I'm a Gryffindor"" over and over again. If you're not an HP fan, just say ""If <favorite fictional character> can do <dangerous thing they have done>, then I can do this!""


Just follow those tips and you'll be braver in no time!

, You wouldn't the bad guys to find out your true identity, now, would you? Make sure not to tell ANYONE you are a Sailor Scout, and if they ask, just say something like ""What makes you think that?"" or just say ""Umm...."" and walk away.


You can tell some of your close friends and recruit them to be Sailor Scouts too! If they have never seen Sailor Moon, make sure you get them into it before officially making them a Sailor Scout.

",How to Act Like Yamaguchi Kumiko (Yankumi) from Gokusen," Try to dress professionally. If you know you will have to do a lot of running and fighting, then you can wear jerseys or other baggy and comfortable clothes. Glasses is optional, and you can wear your hair down or in two low ponytails.;
, Yankumi can kick anyone's butt. She is such a great fighter that she can even take down a huge gang by herself. She can run for miles and barely get tired. Work on your cardio and strength by running on the treadmill doing squats, push-ups and pull-ups, lifting weights, and jumping rope. Try to learn a defensive martial art, and work on improving your instincts and responses.

, This step is optional, but it would help you get into character. It can be any age group, and good or bad. You can volunteer or be a teacher. Don't give up on any student, and if you have to, tutor them after school. Be dedicated to your job, and do your best to make sure everyone passes.

, ""Fight-Oh!"" is Yankumi's favorite phrase. No matter what, she fights on. Her motivation and positivism rubs off on her students. If you have a goal in mind, never stray from it, no matter how impossible it may seem. Everyday is a new start, so don't drag the past with you.

, Yankumi's students may seem like rebels and delinquents, but inside, when you get to know them, they are good people. Society, however, will always judge on outer appearance and may blame them just because they look like someone who would do it. Believe those who are judged unless there is evidence on them. Fight for them and stand by their side. Try to prove their innocence. This will also earn you a lot of respect, and you may inspire them. Be sure to argue back when someone offend them.

, Yankumi would go into a deep, piercing, and personal speech when the time calls for it. Be sure you have wisdom about the topic, and speak with passion. Always keep morals and virtues high. Never accept anything that is wrong or does not make sense and call people out on it.

, No other teacher would enter a gang's garage to defend their students. Although you may never end up in that situation, you must be willing to do anything and go anywhere for the people you love or are responsible of. You are allowed to have your fears, but do not be a coward and run away if someone needs you. Do not allow anything wrong or immoral to continue in front of you.

, Yankumi knows her ability, and does not need to prove herself to anyone. Even if people make fun of you, ignore them and carry on. Don't cry or fight back. This will show your inner strength, and they may stop when they realize they don't faze you.

, Don't be serious all the time. Have fun and get involved in activities and games if you can. Pout when your sad, smile when you are happy, don't always hide your emotions. Don't be afraid to pitch ideas or games. Go out and play!

, Yankumi can feel others pain, and this helps her connect with others. When someone tells you about their problem, try to help them with it. If someone ask you for help, help! Yankumi once babysat her co-workers child because she had another commitment, and she never complained. Be willing to sacrifice your time for others.

, Don't be dark/closed mysterious, but have a few secrets of your own. Yankumi worked hard to be mysterious and keep her father's company a secret so she would not be fired. However, the way she acts and talks sometimes gives hints about her true nature. If you have a big secret, don't brag or showoff and be sure to cover your trails and slip-ups. If you want, you can have different looks for your different realities.

You can make it yourself by mapping out a pattern of his clothes and sewing it or buy it online at a cosplay shop. Online costumes however, are usually poor quality. Making it yourself makes it distinct and unique. If you have trouble sewing or don't know how, ask a family member or friend that is proficient in the skill to make it for you. You can also read make cosplay costumes.;
, Ukitake's hair is almost waist length, and is quite long. He has snow white hair because of his illness; tuberculosis. A long white wig should do. Make sure to style it like his is.

Watch the episodes and the movies over and over.,
Wear a Japanese school uniform.,
Cut and dye your hair like Shinji's.,
Wear earbuds and listen to music frequently.,
Learn to play cello or another instrument.,
Act shy.,
Travel by subway every time you can.,
Seek love and approval.,
Do as you're told.,
Apologize often.,
Don't react to insult or look for a fight.,
Debate with yourself about almost everything you do.",How to Act Like Shinji Ikari," Observe how he behaves. Understand his fears, thoughts, and desires. You could also read the manga, but keep in mind Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, the manga's author and character designer of the first Evangelion anime, sees Shinji differently from Hideaki Anno, its main writer and director.


Do not watch or read Evangelion if you are under 16. It is a series meant for older audiences, depicting violence and adult content.;
, Unlike most cosplay, this outfit will not look out of place in day-to-day life. It is a simple: a white short-sleeved button-down shirt, a black undershirt, and a pair of black trousers. Complete the look with a dark leather belt and solid white high-top sneakers.


Make sure your dress shirt is made from thick enough material that the black undershirt does not show through. Not only will a sheer shirt make you look less like less like Shinji, but it will also make you look sloppy., Luckily, like Shinji's clothes, his hair is simple and normal. Get your hair cut neat and short but not buzzed. Have bangs that are slightly uneven and long, just touching your eyebrows. Give yourself a middle part. Dye your hair very dark brown to match his if necessary.


If you would prefer to keep your hair the way it is and are simply working on a Shinji cosplay for a convention, wear a wig instead.

, Shinji uses a fictional technology called an SDAT player that looks similar to a portable cassette player.Although cassette players are now outdated, they are not difficult to find. If you'd rather, you can always use an MP3 player instead.


To really get in the mood, listen to classical music, preferably Bach (Suite No.1 Prelude for Cello).
In one episode, Shinji wears a T-shirt with XTC written on it, indicating he may also enjoy new wave.Some bands similar in style to XTC include Shriekback, Gang of Four, Talking Heads, The The, and Elvis Costello., Although Shinji is ashamed of his perceived lack of skill, he is actually an accomplished cellist. His bashful cello playing has been a trait featured prominently since the original series. He also learns the piano in the more recent film Evangelion 3.0: You Can (Not) Redo., Shinji is very introverted and prefers to spend his time alone or with a small group of people. He is also very modest and insecure. However, he eventually begins to open up a little to his fellow pilots over the course of the series.

, A commuter train is Shinji's primary source of transportation. Shinji also rides the train all day to avoid his responsibilities.Additionally, the original series makes heavy use of train motifs., Shinji wants to be loved by everyone, especially his previously estranged father. Shinji cares a lot about what other people think.


Be careful with this step. Approval-seeking is associated with low self-confidence and self-esteem. While Shinji has problems with both, preserve your healthy mindset by not getting too into character.A healthy way of gaining approval is to be actively conscientious of other people's feelings. Ask others about their needs and avoid being selfish., Because of Shinji's need for outside validation, he often does what authority figures demand. He is extremely passive.


Take care of your responsibilities, like homework and assigned chores, when asked. You can mentally compare these tasks to Shinji's obligations to protect humanity.
As with the previous step, don't take this one too seriously. Shinji may pilot a giant robot, but don't put yourself in harm's way.

, One of Shinji's negative qualities is that he completely lacks confidence and often blames himself for things that aren't his fault. Try not to let this act affect you too deeply. Instead, apologize only when you have done something wrong, or in instances where there is some ambiguity, such as when someone bumps into you or you and your friend have a miscommunication.


In general, apologizing too much is a bad idea. If you did nothing wrong, saying ""sorry"" can make you lose self-confidence., Be kind and nice to others. Shinji is, at heart, a very compassionate character. Although he must fight to protect humanity, he strongly dislikes violence. In addition, he is so passive that he does not outwardly react to insults, even though he is deeply hurt by them.


Repeated insults or threats can be considered bullying. If you experience bullying, speak with a teacher if it occurs at school or a manager if it happens at work. If you are a minor, tell your parents. If you feel your safety is threatened, call the police.

, Shinji is very introspective and tends to overthink things. Introspection can be healthy. Real-time mindfulness, where you are aware of your feelings in the moment, leads to a happier, more positive life.A healthy amount of self-reflection after stressful events may also help you to better handle similar problems in the future.Remember, Shinji sometimes worried that he was alone and not worthy of living, but in the end realizes that he is loved and controls his life.
Despite these realizations, Shinji still deals with self-loathing.This is another case where you shouldn't act like Shinji; remember to always love yourself.
Psychologists term unhealthy, obsessive thinking about pain and trauma ""rumination."" To stay healthy, avoid slipping into rumination. If you find yourself unable to stop, talk to a doctor."

Pay attention and work hard in class.",How to Act Like Miharu Rokujo (for Girls),";
, Test your voice change; But keep in mind, you don't really have to change it a lot. Keep your voice but just make it sound really bored and apathetic.

, Look like you don't care about normal (or abnormal) things, this doesn't mean never smile (because that's impossible), just don't walk into class with a big grin or an angry scowl.

, Try not to look mindless, just a bored expression will do, Miharu always looks like he's bored. But with an extremely close friend like Miharu was with Yoite, you can lighten up and show a little emotion. Not just with anyone though. One or two people is fine.

, Remember, you can laugh as much as you want over a joke by yourself in a quiet place, in your own mind, or at home, but when a person tells you a joke, or something funny or joyful, don't smile or laugh. Be nice, express your emotions by your words, and not by your facial expression.

, Not ever. Even if something happens to be funny to others, just watch them laugh and pretend to insult them under your breath. When something is surprising, pretend that you already knew about it or just walk away.

, Just wear straight/skinny but not too skinny jeans and a normal shirt. Miharu doesn't really care what he wears and he's somewhat androgynous. Even though he doesn't care, he still doesn't want to look like a slob. So just wear normal jeans, converse, and a shirt. Nothing baggy or flashy.

, Miharu's hair is neat because it is short and close to his head, yet messy because it's flying in every different direction. One example is a ponytail. It's neat because it's pulled back, yet it can be messy when you leave strands out in the front.

, Miharu isn't someone who hates the world, he may be indifferent and apathetic but he isn't mean or cruel either.

, Always be aware of what's around you. Examine the room carefully but quickly. Don't Show your emotions, especially when your working. Try maintaining the straight face. Staying quiet is one of the best techniques, but people around you may think your eavesdropping so stay focused and when somebody calls you .Keep the same face and don't move an inch and ignore them until they come to you., Concentrate intently on your face and body. Make sure that you do not react physically in any way. Reacting in your head is fine, but it cannot extend to your face or body.

,, During class, do not speak to anybody unless spoken to by a teacher.

, Choose a desk at the far back of the class, a desk by itself away from your class group, but not so far to the point where you aren't able to pay attention or can't see what the teacher is saying.

, Just like she fights for Anthy Himemiya, the rose bride, you, too, must fight for the things that are right, and what you believe in. Don't be afraid to get your word out.

, Yes, you are trying to capture the essence of Utena by being her, but that doesn't mean you still can't be yourself. Do things because you feel like doing them (remember, Utena was the only girl to wear the boys uniform, simply because she said, ""It suits me better; I like it."").

, Tomboy Utena tenjou acted like a man, but still had a feminine side, and got playboy Akio (and, unintentionally, Touga). Don't chase after them. Instead, use your natural grace and charm. Be strong, but don't come across too strong.

, If you really want, you could try dyeing your hair pink.

, Utena is a trusting (sometimes too much), loving girl. She isn't a liar either, so don't lie. Remember to do the right thing, even if it's the hardest thing to do.

, Yes, Utena was good at almost every sport. Join an afterschool sport. Who knows? You might find that you're really good at it.

, Depending which version you like, grow your hair out (anime) or cut it short (movie).

, Hey, even Utena had to draw the line sometimes. Learn to defend yourself (both physically, and verbally) and not only will you feel good about yourself, but you'll probably be admired for it, too.

, Utena wanted to be the prince that never came for her, so she tried her best to be one. Try your best all the time. Never give up!

Put together your costume.",How to Act like Monkey D. Luffy from One Piece1,"

Be Flexible.,
Be strong.,
Don't be afraid to be stupid.,
Never ever turn your back on your friends.,
Get in shape.,
Never back down from a fight.

,
Gather a crew.,
Travel often.,
Have a dream.,
Be optimistic.",How to Act like Monkey D. Luffy from One Piece2," Odds are, you may or WILL get hurt, but you can't let that get you down. Remember, and Adventurer's life is full of dangers and risks, don't take up this lifestyle unless your sure you want to (if you're not willing, then it's better to be wise and safe, than to be fearless and dead).

, Okay, sadly there are no trees that just happen to produce Gum Gum Fruits, but you can be somewhat flexible by stretching your joints. If needed, take yoga classes and spend more time stretching when you exercise (you won't be able to perform Gum Gum Storm, but hey, at least you'll be more flexible over time).

, Choose the martial art you like the most and take a course.

, Everyone is stupid in some way, there is no way around it, so do not be afraid to unleash your inner idiot, because Luffy is pretty much the prime example of ""Ignorance is Bliss"". Don't be too stupid. Luffy has a good sense of things he knows.

, Your friends are not only your crew, but your family as well.

, Although Luffy eats like he's going to break the chair, you never see him overweight (unless he finished eating, or he's doing Gum Gum Balloon) So exercise, and eat right.

,, A pirate is nothing without his crew. Choose your crew wisely. Close friends or family are recommended. If you find someone you want to join you, simply ask.

, You're a pirate, you can't always stay in one place with the authorities on your tail. Drift from place to place, and make sure to always have a good amount of money on you. If you find yourself low on funds, offer to do some part time work to gain some more, but do not stay longer than necessary.

, Everyone's got it, either your dream is to be King of the Pirates, or the owner of a mega-corporation. I will be the pirate king! hold onto that dream and do whatever you can to see it realized.

, Don't be afraid to laugh at your misfortune, be nice to everyone you meet. Be friendly and social and laugh a lot (and smile a lot as well) and always look at the bright side of things. Optimism is key.

First off, be a tomboy and/or a tough girl.,

Don't be afraid to show your guy friends up.,
Kaoru has two really girly friends, Blossom and Bubbles, so feel free to have girly friends, or just friends that are different from you.",How to Act Like Kaoru Matsubara (PPGZ)," (see Act Like a Tomboy and Be a Tough Girl);
, Kaoru often goes for the boyish look and feel of guys clothes, so try venturing into the guys section once in a while.

, She's also seen wearing yellow and orange, most of your clothes should be guys clothes in these colors. Track suits are always a good choice. Look at Kaoru's two everyday outfits to get some ideas.

, Don't gush or talk in a really high pitched voice. Find the right volume and pitch, and don't mumble. Make sure you sound confident. Swearing doesn't mean you're a tomboy, either, so don't overdo it. It can sound cheap and fake if overused. You don't have to use ""dude"" or ""man"" or ""awesome"", however, feel free to use slang, skater lingo, and Ebonics as much a possible.

, Kaoru's favorite store is the sports supply store. She's always buying new sports equipment. You should probably make this your favorite store too. While your at it choose your sports. Soccer is a must, after that feel free to do anything. At school you should be known as the ""jock"" (see Be a Girl Jock for more on this)

, Board sports are good (skateboarding, snowboarding, surfing, body boarding), but if the guys you hang out with aren't into that, don't be afraid to try out paintball or football. And make sure you get good at it - but don't brag. It means you'll have a chance to hang out with them at the skate park/on the slopes/at the beach and join in with them rather than watching from the sidelines. Furthermore, you'll be able to discuss the sport with them, and last of all...guys like girls who aren't afraid to get a little scuffed around the edges and don't cry over a broken nail.

, Learn to play a verity of games, like shooters (Metroid Prime 1, 2 and 3), fighting(SSB, Melee and Brawl, Street Fighter saga), Adventure, Action, MMOs, and MMORPGs.

, After school you and your friends can go to the skate park and have skating contests. Kaoru's prized position is her skateboard, but if it's just not you that's cool.

, It keeps you feeling cool in hot weathers and when you play some sports, especially running games.

, You can bet they are gonna crack on you, so don't be afraid to rag on guys. This is an easy lead in to flirting though so be careful.

, It's optional, but you could try it. Many guys are into Call of Duty, so consider yourself one of the guys if they invite you to play. Practice at home and/or look up tips so you can keep up and whop their butts.

, Most guys don't even notice that new shirt unless it's so low cut they can't help it.

, Make sure you actually understand the premise and various metaphors, as chances are one of these films will crop up in conversation and if you have an intelligent opinion you will be respected by the others.

, If you know something about cars they don't, you can still talk about it. They will actually think it's kind of cool that you know cars.

, But don't just get new friends just because they fit their profile.

Try to not worry about others' opinions too much.,
Be good at complimenting girls.",How to Act Like Haruhi Fujioka," Haruhi is always studying. See How to Get Straight ""A""s. She has a lot of common sense. Try to study and work hard in school, be sensible and do what you think is the right thing. But Haruhi works hard in other things besides school, like housework. Try to work hard in both areas.;
, This and hard work go hand-in-hand in Haruhi's personality--she is the kind of girl who does things for herself. You can try to get things done by yourself such as cleaning your bedroom, doing your homework, cooking, or cleaning. This will show responsibility and independence.

, Haruhi can easily understand how somebody feels. By not being rich, Haruhi is more down to earth than the other members of the Host Club. You can try to be more understanding by listening to others, try to picture yourself in their shoes, understanding situations, and seeing how somebody is feeling.

, Haruhi is very informed, and she sometimes looks down on Tamaki, who is not. Don't rely on watered-down soundbites from 24 hour news channels and Comedy Central as your source of information on what's happening in the world.


Haruhi isn't materialistic. She's really not girly in any way, she tries to save her money any way she can, like getting freebies from the store. Work hard for your money and save it.
Haruhi is more mature than other girls her age, mostly because her mother died when she was young. Haruhi had to grow up faster and be more independent. Try to be more mature.

, Pick up the clothes on your floor. Wash your dishes after using. Don't reuse the week old socks. Walk the dog. Feed the dog. Study. Get a job. Look for ways to show that you're responsible.

, If Haruhi's voice was too high pitched, then she would have been immediately been recognized as a girl. If it was too deep, she might not ever been discovered as not being a boy. Meaning: you can't sound too high pitched or too deep. Test your voice change. If it sounds like a girl's, then make it deeper, but if it sounds like a boy's, make it higher. Practice and soon you'll get the hang of it.

,(optional) You should be completely flat. A sports bra may work if you are very small, but for anyone over an AA it won't work. You will need some sort of binder. If you are about an A or a very small B you can use Under Armour, which is intended for men who are athletes. You should be able to find their compression vests in a sports store. For anyone above that, you'll need a binder. Underworks, Mango and T-Kingdom make these.

, (optional) Try using hoodies, vests and button down shirts.

, Haruhi is more of a tomboy than a girly-girl. Although Haruhi mostly wears mens clothing, she can wear girls clothes around people who know her true gender. Try purchasing baggy clothes that don't show off your figure too much. For example; baggy jeans or cargo pants/shorts, a long sleeve white t-shirt and sneakers. Don't wear make-up and make sure any hair accessories you wear are pretty plain-looking.

, Preferably in shades of grey, blue, black and red.

, What other people think of you is not anything to be extremely concerned about. Many people may assume that constantly worrying over others' opinions on themselves and trying to make everyone like them more is the key to seeming superior, but it is not. You do not want that image.

, One thing Haruhi is really good at is complimenting other girls. Now Haruhi actually looked like a boy, so don't flirt, just compliment. Don't feel pressure to say something because some girls are just plain mean. If you're friends with her or don't know her, then she's a pretty good candidate.

If you want to be arrogant, try practicing as well to let your skills do the talking. Do stamina training, sit ups for the stomach and push ups for the arms. Adjust your timetable, practice tennis and get your level of fitness up. Tip: Create ingenious names for your techniques. Seriously, does ""Super Ultra Great Delicious Mountain Storm"" even give you the chills? How about the ""Super Great Momoshiro Special?"" If you want to be cool and arrogant, stick to your great play and techniques with daunting names. (PS: No offense meant Kintaro-kun and Momo senpai! But seriously, pfft.)

, Do not lose yourself amid any situation. Practice meditation and always focus on keeping your composure. (Oh and by meditation, it means you always have to drink a can of Ponta to keep your cool. Formula: a can of aspartame = damaged brain cells which will lead to a calm state of mind)

, Beat all the challenges that come your way with determination and show that you are not afraid of anything. (Tip: You might want to learn from Rikkaidai's mother-captain, Yukimura Seiichi or from the venerable buchou of Fudomine, Tachibana Kippei. They most certainly embody the essence of high admiration as seen from their respective teams.)

Have fun!",How to Act and Look Like an Attractive Anime Girl for Cosplay," You may love a character, and think you could cosplay her perfectly, but if she’s not very well known, you’re not likely to get much of a response from other people. The best characters to cosplay as are iconic and distinctive. They don't need to be the most well-known characters, but you will want at least a fraction of convention attendees to know who you're playing as.


If being seen as attractive is your priority, think about which characters members of the fan community are most attracted to, and which ones you find most beautiful.;
, Cosplay means costume art to some, but truly dedicated cosplayers act out their character. This requires having a solid knowledge of the character's motivations, history and psychology.Look into the source material and give yourself a crash course in the character. Ask yourself questions and try to answer them yourself. What is her darkest secret? How would she react to a stranger? What hobbies does she have? These may not have a big effect on the character's personality, but it helps you get into the proper mindset.


For example, if you're going as Rei Ayanami from the Neon Genesis Evangelion universe, it helps to watch the show closer to the date of the convention. Observe the way she is animated, and pay attention to her character arc. A good cosplayer might simply act shy and mysterious, but the best cosplayers will try to get into the actual mindset of the character.

, To be a great cosplayer, you should be able to capture the essence of your character in a single pose. Without movement or talking, frame your body in such a way that expresses something of the character's personality. Practice some poses in front of the mirror and see if something sticks. If you're having a trouble finding one that really works, try looking up artwork or promo photos for the character you're cosplaying as and copy it.


For instance, an action-based character like someone from the Kingdom Hearts series may suit a battle-ready stance. On the other hand, a schoolgirl-type character from the shojo manga Love Hina. Anime characters are often boldly characterized, so it shouldn't be difficult to pinpoint the dominant mood for the character you're going as.

Poses are best-suited for photo ops. If your costume is impressive enough, you're bound to get a lot of attention. Having a few good poses will maximize how good you look in photos., Dressing up as an attractive anime girl can be an open invitation for some of these less desirable types. If someone like this approaches you or makes a comment you're not comfortable with, the best thing you can do is ignore it and walk away. Nothing breaks character like genuine stress, and you don't want negative feelings to get in the way of your convention experience.


If someone is persistently harassing you, it's a good idea to contact security.

, Cosplay if ultimately about expressing yourself, and the best way to do that is through confidence. If you're confident about what you're doing, the cosplay act will come more naturally. Of course, this may be easier said than done for a lot of people. Confidence is not the sort of thing that happens overnight. Nonetheless, you should pat yourself on the back for the fact alone you are putting yourself out there via cosplay. Cosplay takes courage, and simply being interested in doing it means you've got what it takes.

, One of the great things about cosplay is that it is a communal activity. Chances are there are others who have cosplayed as the same anime character you've chosen. Looking online at sites like Cosplay.com and Kotaku will yield lots of inspiration.Take a look at the details in costumes you see. Are there any liberties taken with the source material? Any effective makeup techniques? In the end, you want to be your own attractive anime girl, but it doesn't hurt to lean on the innovations of others when you find yourself stuck.


Some cosplayers combine characters for a hybrid cosplay. This is only recommended if you really know what you're doing., Find some pictures of your chosen anime character for reference. From there, you should be able to break down what you need for the costume. Some costumes are easier to put together than others. Many anime characters use a ""schoolgirl"" aesthetic; the clothes for costumes like this can be purchased at stores. More elaborate designs will require sewing on your part. If you want to have an attractive costume, it's important that your costume shows off your figure. This doesn't necessarily mean wearing a high-cut skirt, but it does mean you should do without costumes that blanket your figure.


If you're in a bind, the Japanese ""schoolgirl"" outfit is a great pick. Even if you don't end up representing a character in particular, you'll definitely fit in with the crowd.

, While it's still recommended you base your costume choices around a certain character, wearing a skirt is a standard look for the Japanese schoolgirl. Many anime girls match this look. Luckily, skirts of this sort can be purchased from a department store, or ordered online.

, Boots are a bold type of clothing, and will make your costume more attention-grabbing. Boots already fit into a lot of anime costume designs, but you should choose your footwear to suit the character you've chosen.


If you're going for a schoolgirl look, boots may be too assertive.
Cosplay costumes can get incredibly expensive. When you're first starting out, it's recommended you try to keep costs to a minimum. This will make sure you are able to afford other costumes as time goes on. Only seasoned cosplayers should let themselves settle into a single costume.

, How you go about making a costume depends on how skilled you as a seamstress. To get a more specific costume for your anime character, you can sew, cut and hem existing pieces of clothing to fit your costume. In most cases, the clothes you use for this purpose will be permanently changed, so it's best to use old clothing you don't normally wear anymore or go shopping at a thrift store., Fabric that is flimsy, stretchy, or shiny tends to be very difficult to sew, which can lead to extremely unflattering costumes. Unless you are an extremely confident sewer, avoid these fabrics.Plain and medium weight fabrics are the easiest for beginners to sew with. Look for natural fabrics like poplin, cotton broadcloth, and lightweight wools.Darker prints make it easier to hide imperfect seams.If you're using patterned fabric, go for a small pattern rather than a large one. A large pattern will need to be matched up at the seams, which is much harder to do., Detailed costumes are great, but if you're in a pinch, you can usually do something simple to make your costume distinctive or recognizable. Depending on your knowledge of anime, you may be able to think of ways to spruce up your look. Even if you only have a schoolgirl costume, adding a Pokeball (from the Pokemon universe) will signal to everyone that you're playing as someone from that world.

, Anime is a very distinctive animation style, and the most distinctive thing about it is arguably the way in which eyes are exaggerated. Cosplaying as an anime girl, you can get these bigger eyes with makeup.Pencil your eyes with a white eyeliner, and extend the frame of your eyes using a light-shaded eyeshadow. Eyeshadow should be used to create a new, wider shape for the eyes. Lightly smudge it where the eyeshadow ends for a blended look.


While this is more eyeshadow that you may be used to wearing, the rest of your eye makeup should be kept mild. This will make the bigger eyes more believable. Exceptions should be made if your character suits a different kind of eye makeup.

, Because eyes are so important to the anime drawing style, you want to bring as much attention to the eyes as possible. Contact lenses are a quick and relatively affordable way of spicing up your look.Study the design of your character's eyes, and make a judgement call whether you think coloured contacts would fit her loo.

, Female characters in anime tend to be very stylized. Many anime girls look like dolls, and makeup should be used to get that look. Blush can get used to get the reddened cheeks of anime characters. You may also want to make your face paler using foundation and concealer. Watch the anime your character is based in if you need specific inspiration for the look. The best cosplays are specifically based around the details of a character.


Makeup is a less important part of cosplaying, so you shouldn't worry about it too much if makeup isn't your forte.

, It is recommended that you try to style your hair based on a character. With that said, straightening your hair will give you a more Japanese look. Bangs are also a staple hairstyle in anime. It's recommended you find a picture of your favourite anime character and get a hairstylist to match your hair to it.


Wigs are also a possibility. Suitable wigs for your costume should be available at a costume store.

, Cosplay has a very passionate and inclusive community. If you don't already have friends that are into it, it's a good idea to meet some fellow fans. Because it's such a popular subculture, cosplay groups are quite easy to hook up with online.Look for public groups on social media sites like Facebook. If you join up with one of these groups, you can begin making friends by listing some of your favourite animes.

, Depending on where you live, some travelling may be required. Cosplay conventions range significantly in size and scope. At first, it is recommended you choose a smaller one. They're less overwhelming, and it's easier to make friends with people when there's less chaos.Conventions usually cost around $20-60 USD to attend per day.

, While doing a cosplay project on your own is perfectly fine, many cosplayers find it more enjoyable to go as a group. If you're planning on going to a convention with some friends, you might decide as a group to dress as characters from a certain anime. Theme groups tend to leave a much bigger impression at conventions than individual costumes.


Groups are also safer to go in. Conventions sometimes come with the risk of guys who harass attractive cosplayers. If you're in a group, it'll be easier to keep them at bay.

, Some of them may be interested in taking your picture. Although it's usually to be taken as a compliment if someone asks to take your picture, it's ultimately up to you whether you're comfortable for that or not. Politely decline and move on if you're not okay with it.


If you're worried about harassment, going in a group can help alleviate the pressure. It's usually recommended you have a friend there to look out for you in the slight chance there's an issue.

, You might not think so at first, but cosplay conventions can be physically exhausting. Walking around and posing all day can have an effect on anyone's fatigue. It's recommended you prepare for a convention day by doing 5-10 minutes of light stretches and warming up before heading in.Stretch out your arms and legs to make sure they're limber. Neck and arm rolls will ease the risk of strain throughout your day.

, The most important thing at any convention is that you enjoy yourself. Preparing for a convention can be stressful, and conventions themselves can feel overwhelming at first. Once you get past the worst of it however, they can be a ton of fun. There are many things you can do to maximize your enjoyment of conventions:


Take your own photos.Why wait for others to photograph you? Take photos of yourself and other cosplayers. It's a great way to immortalize the memory.
Check out anime booths. There's often a lot of interesting fan merch for sale. If you're a fan of anime, you'll find plenty to love. Taking some money with you to purchase souvenirs can be fun.
Socialize and meet people. Everyone at the convention is ultimately there because they share a love of the same artform. This can be the foundation to meet new lifelong friends. Even if lasting friendships don't come out of it, it can still be great to talk shop about common interests.

Ciel has a somewhat Gothic style, like his skull cane and pendant.,
Don't overreact.,
Read up on current issues and events in the newspaper and other legitimate sources.,Correct people often and/or talk back if somebody tells you you can't do something or you're too weak.",How to Act Like Ciel Phantomhive from Kuroshitsuji," This is the single most important step. Even before you get to characteristics, remember: you can laugh as much as you want over a joke by yourself in a quiet place, in your own mind, or at home, but when a person tells you a joke, or something funny or joyful, don't smile or laugh. (Although, an evil smile can make you look mysterious) Be nice; express your emotions by your words and not by your facial expression.;
, Ciel is an English noble, who must succumb to a higher standards of manners. Just keep it classy. ""Please"" and ""thank you"" are always a must.

, Honestly, Ciel could be cast as a boy or a girl. Nothing makes him distinctly one gender (and in one episode he wore a dress to sneak into a party). The haircut also plays a factor in his androgynous appearance.

, Ciel is very smart for a twelve/thirteen year old. He has to be in order to take over ""Funtom"" and solve crimes for the queen. First of all, read attentively. Nonfiction is even better. Second, pay attention in school and try to expand your education whenever possible. You never know when you will need your knowledge to apply to the current situation.

, This means that you need to shower daily. Wear deodorant and wash your face daily. When picking out your clothing for the day, know what looks good on you.

, Keep most colors dull and neutral. Save anything brighter for special occasions. Black is not necessary. Ciel normally wears a green blazer with matching shorts. On special occasions he wears a dark blue shorts-suit with a ruffled shirt and a matching top hat.

,, You must be courteous, but never bend over backwards to please others. Limit your time and availability and draw boundaries with others so that they are aware of your limits. Ciel is very aware of his limits but never lets anyone else remind him.

, He is into more subtle colors; black, blue, green, and grey-red are normally associated with goth. His style is mostly 'classy goth' or 'kodona/boy lolita', so those are ones to look up.

, Not ever, even if something happens to be funny to others; just watch them laugh and insult them under your breath. When something is surprising, pretend that you already knew about it.

, As an earl in the 19th century, Ciel has to be aware of current events.

Be familiar with Kuudere characters in anime and manga.,
Act uncaring, but still be caring.,
Be intelligent and knowledgeable.,
Don't show emotions.,
Be independent.,
Act high class, but don't be snobby or people will dislike you.,
Don't talk too much.,
Play pranks on your friends.,
Be mysterious.,
Keep your talents to yourself.,
Always remember to be nice.",How to Act Like a Kuudere," Use these characters for guidance and inspiration when creating your own Kuudere persona. For example, get to know Ciel Phantomhive from Black Butler and Mai Minakami from Nichijou.;
, Though this may seem like a contradiction, a Kuudere is at heart a caring and compassionate person, they just hide it. For example, do nice things for people, but don't let them know it's you, or don't let them think you've gone out of your way to do something nice. If someone needs something, say, a pencil, give it to them, but don't say anything, or mumble: ""...here.""

, Read harder books with new vocabulary. Non-Fiction is a good choice. Do remember to pay attention in school. You can even study a dictionary if you want to. Work hard to excel in school and be as smart and academically successful as you can.

, Keep a poker face on at all times. If someone insults you, don't lose your temper and fight back. Instead, use good comebacks. Always keep your cool. When someone tells you a joke, don't smile or laugh. You can laugh all you want at home or somewhere private, but a Kuudere won't ever show that emotion in front of other people.

, Don't rely on others too much. Do the things that you can do by yourself first. Then if you need assistance, ask someone close to you for help.

, Learn good etiquette and manners. Speak and act politely in public. For guys, be a gentleman. For girls, act like a proper lady. Don't use slang or profane words; use good and correct grammar. Be mature.

, Speak only when necessary, such as answering questions or giving speeches. If you want to answer, don't answer in a sentence. Answer in a phrase or as few words as possible. For example, say ""boring"" instead of ""My summer break was pretty boring,"" or ""nothing to do"" rather than ""I had nothing to do, since my parents didn't let me watch TV or go outside."" Don't elaborate or explain unless asked, and even then, do so in as few words as possible.

, This can be a great way to show off your playful spirit behind your cool exterior. However, when doing these pranks, be sure not to show any emotions or expressions at all. Have that ""cool vibe"" around you.

, Make people wonder what you're thinking about. Keep them wondering, that's the most important part.

, If you are multi talented or gifted, if you excel at everything, don't brag about it. If you want to show your talent to people, don't make it seem like you're showing off. Do it with a poker face, and try not to care whether they like or dislike your talents. Don't show any emotions when you're performing.

, Even if you're emotionless and cold, don't be mean to people. Remember that a Kuudere only acts uncaring and distant; in fact, you should care about others just as much as anyone else.


Remember to be nice to your friends. Don't get so into acting Kuudere that you neglect your friendships. Don't worry about keeping up the act with them, just be normal and be yourself.

Research anime conventions in your area.,
Select a convention based on your budget.,
Register early.,
Determine your transportation to the convention.,
Decide if you will need accommodations for the convention.,
Prepare a cosplay.,
Create a convention survival kit.,
Read the convention guide and make a schedule of events.,
Wear comfortable clothing and shoes.,
Arrive early.,
Split up if you have different interests than your companions.,
Socialize with other convention attendees.",How to Attend an Anime Convention," Before you can attend an anime convention or ""con"", you will need to find one that fits your interests and your budget. There are many anime conventions throughout the world and in North America. Some cons are massive events with thousands of people in attendance for several days of fun. Others are smaller events where you have a smaller crowd and can experience the con in a few hours. You should consider how much you can afford to spend on travel for the con and how much you want to take in at the con.Bigger conventions have a longer list of things to do but they can be overwhelming for first time attendees. You may want to go to a specific anime convention to see an anime celebrity or to experience a particular sub genre of anime with other attendees.
You can research different anime conventions at Animecons.com, which lists almost every anime convention in the world by region, country, and state. You can also look at the ten largest anime conventions in North America on Animecons.com.
Some of the largest anime conventions include the Anime Expo in Los Angeles, California, the Anime North in Toronto, Ontario, and Anime Central in Rosemont, Illinois.;
, You should determine how much money you, and any companions coming with you, can afford to spend on the anime convention. At the minimum, you will need to budget for the anime convention badge, buying food, purchasing anime merchandise, and preparing your cosplay, if you are doing one. If you decide to travel for an anime convention, you will need to budget for transportation to and from the con as well as accommodations.Smaller anime conventions usually cost around $30 for a pre-registered badge. Larger conventions can cost $50-$60 for a badge. You may also need to factor renting a hotel room or a home stay, as well as transportation, such as airplane tickets or parking and gas for a car.
You may decide to go with friends or a partner to cut down on the costs of the anime convention, especially if you are on a tight budget.

, You should always try to pre-register for anime cons, as it will cost you less to attend and you will get to wait in a shorter line to pick up your badge. If you decide to pre-register, you should make sure you are able to attend as most anime con badges are non-refundable and non-transferable.You should also be sure that you are able to attend all three days of the anime convention, if you are going to a larger convention, before you pre-register. You may need to request days off at work or clear your schedule on the convention days so you have enough time to experience the convention.
If you do not pre-register for the anime convention, you can still pick up your pass at the door. But it will likely be more expensive and you will have to wait in a longer line.

, Once you have your anime convention badge, you should consider whether you will need to travel to get to the convention and if so, how you are going to get there. Will you have to fly or can you drive to the convention? Driving may be cheaper, but you should factor in the cost of parking and gas to ensure it is a budget friendly option. You may have to fly if the convention is far from where you live, as you may not want to spend too much of your free time commuting to the convention by car.You should check for flight deals online in the weeks or months leading up to the convention. You may want to give yourself a buffer of one day before the convention or arrive the night before so you can get settled in your accommodations before the convention starts.
You should consider other transportation options like taking the train or the bus, especially if you are on a tight budget. You should factor in the travel time that will be required if you take the train or the bus and make sure it is worth the effort.

, If you are traveling outside of your home area for the convention, you will need accommodations. You may go for a hotel or a motel, especially if you are traveling with companions and you can split the cost of the room. Or, you may see if you have friends you can stay with for a few nights during the convention to cut costs.You should check with the anime convention to see if they have reserved hotel rooms for attendees close to the convention center. Some larger anime cons offer discounted rates to attendees. These rooms tend to fill up fast so try to reserve them right after you buy your badge or as soon as they become available.
Most hotels require you to be at least 18-21 years of age to book a hotel room. You are usually allowed no more than four people per a room. If you are trying to save money, you may decide to split the hotel room four ways.

, A cosplay is a costume in the style of an anime character. You may buy a cosplay or make your own cosplay at home. You should start making your cosplay costume early so it is ready in time for the convention. Get friends or parents to help you put together your cosplay and have fun making your own version of a beloved anime character.Make sure your costume is appropriate for a potentially crowded con if you are going to a larger anime convention. Try to avoid long trailing pieces of clothing that could easily be stepped on or large accessories on your back that could hit people as you turn around. Your costume should allow you to move around easily and see reasonably well. If your costume does limit your vision, recruit a friend to escort you around the con and try to stay aware of your surroundings.
If you're cosplaying, practice poses in costume beforehand. That way you'll be ready to strut your stuff when people ask to photograph you - and they will if your cosplay is halfway decent!

, You should make sure you pack the essentials for the con, or a convention survival kit, so you are prepared. You should include several key items in your convention survival kit, including:


A sewing kit, duct tape, and markers to make emergency repairs on your cosplay. This way, if your cosplay gets damaged, you can fix it easily and quickly.
Loose cash to spend on food and souvenirs. You may want to set a budget so you do not spend too much money on clothing, posters, DVDs, books, and other merchandise at the con.
A camera and extra batteries or a plug in charger. You will likely be taking lots of pictures of other cosplays and anime celebrities, so make sure your camera is always charged and ready to go.
Photo ID with you as well as loose cash and a debit or credit card.
Water and snacks for when you get hungry between meals, as well as sunscreen. You may end up lining up outside to get into the venue and you do not want to get a sunburn in the process., Most anime cons have a schedule of events on their website a few weeks before the con starts. You should read the convention guide and highlight events or celebrities you would like to see. You may collaborate with your companions to make sure you all see who and what you want during the con.You should also make sure you have enough time throughout the day to see everything. You may block off your schedule and make a plan day by day. You can then adjust the schedule once you get to the con, if necessary.
You should look at the list of food options on the convention’s website or around the convention. This way, you know what to expect for food options and can budget accordingly. You may end up bringing food with you or eating at your accommodations to save money.

, If you are not cosplaying, you should make sure you are wearing comfortable clothes and walking shoes, as you will likely be on your feet most of the day. The convention may be hot once you are inside the venue, so you may want to dress in layers to stay comfortable.You should make sure your cellphone is fully charged and your camera is fully charged. If you are with friends, you should exchange numbers so you can find each other in the event you get separated or lost.

, You should plan to arrive at least 30 minutes to 1 hour before the anime convention opens so you can get in the line. This will also give you enough time to pick up your badge in the convention and experience all the events at the con.You should also be sure to arrive early for events that you know are going to be popular, such as a meet and greet with an anime celebrity. Lining up early will ensure you use your time at the convention well and increase your chances of getting into popular events.

, You and your friends may end up having different events or booths that you want to check out. You may end up splitting up and agree to meet back later at a particular spot in the convention center. Make sure you all have each other’s contact information and an agreed upon meeting spot and time. The con may be very crowded so this will prevent you all from losing each other.

, You may be going to the anime convention to look at other people’s cosplay and get merchandise of your favorite manga. Or you may go to the con to show off your cosplay and bond with other cosplaying attendees. Try to socialize with others at the con and be friendly with other attendees.You may get pictures with anime celebrities or request a picture of someone’s cosplay. Try to give cosplayers room when you are walking around the convention so their cosplay does not get damaged. Have fun and try to experience the con to the fullest.

Watch ""School Rumble"" as this should be your door in becoming Harima Kenji, of course.,
Observe his hairstyle, clothing, hobbies.,
Improve your skills.,
Be More Anti-social.,
Mimic Kenji's Mannerisms.,
Illustrate how you wish your life was going in comics/mangas.,
Be strong!,
Be a fool for love.,
Learn how to fight.,
This step is optional, due to what age you are, but you could learn how to ride a motorcycle, but please earn your driver's license first.",How to Act Like Harima Kenji,";
, If you can't imitate his physical appearance because you think that you might look weird, then try to imitate his good attitude. Attitudes build the true body of a character.


Get some sunglasses, a nice black leather jacket or two, some boots and always wear a tee shirt. You can also mix it up with a turtleneck. Remember to keep your colors dark! Black, white, brown, etc...

, Harima Kenji has secret talents and he is being defined as a skillful man in School Rumble. People might also call you a Skillful Man.

, Don't cut yourself off from civilization, but where ever you go (be it school, the mall, whatever) try to distance yourself from others. Add in a comment or two once in a while, but don't be afraid to speak your mind out loud if someone opposes you. Also, try to find the balance of remaining friendly, but stern.

, Even if you can't physically look like Harima, you can still have his demeanor. Kenji is very dramatic with his movements, and he doesn't really care who sees, so let go of that whole ""what if someone sees me"" thought first. Try talking with your hands a lot, and ""thinking out loud"" which is basically talking to yourself. Be melodramatic with everything you do.

, Harima's greatest hidden talent is his artwork. If you can't draw very well, start taking classes or looking through art tutorials. Once your art skill is good enough to make comics, start drawing out and illustrating little stories about how you wish your life could go.

, Harima's not only physically strong, but more importantly, he is mentally strong. As he told Eri, Kenji Harima always finds the strength to get right back up if he fails and gets knocked down. He keeps on trying to achieve his dream, even if it seems impossible to come true.

, Even if you don't have your eye on someone special, try to become a little more romantic, but of course, don't make it obvious that you are a hopeless romantic!

, Harima Kenji's fighting style is street fighting, but it would be best to learn some martial arts.

, Kenji is known for always riding a motorcycle around town.

First things first, assuming you know basic skills of playing, a jazz mouthpiece will greatly help.,
Get jazz reeds.,

Learn to swing.,
Learn the seven modes.,
Listen.,
Join a jazz band.,
Take private lessons.",How to Play Jazz Saxophone," Otto Link makes an amazing ebonite mouthpiece for jazz, as does Meyer. Vandoren v16 and Java are specifically for jazz, while the V5, as long as it is open, is a great saxophone mouthpiece. Also check out Jody Jazz and the Selmer supper session, as well as the Selmer sd20 All the greats, Charlie Parker, Coltrane, Cannonball, Brecker... used a jazz mouthpiece. Remember, a jazz mouthpiece should be open, for basic jazz from size 6-8 or 9 should work, for big band music, 5-8 should work and for crazy funk and fusion, 7-11. Don't be deceived by players that you can use your classical mouthpiece for jazz.;
, jazz reeds are highly recommended and so is a good ligature. Rico Select Jazz reeds are really good, and Vandoren makes four specifically for jazz, The jazz ZZ, Java green, java red, and the V16. The v16 provides a very full sound. Vandoren traditional reeds also work decently for jazz. Hemke reeds are also great for jazz. Smooth jazz star Kenny G uses Hemke reeds. Many websites allow you to buy one reed of a certain type. Do this for several and find the one you like best. It should both sound good and respond easily.

Add the correct equalizing and other effects.",How to Mic a Saxophone1," This mic allows a sound engineer to raise the volume much higher when mixing the sound. In addition, a dynamic mic can handle a much higher sound pressure level (SPL).


An instrument mic, such as a Shure SM57 or an Audix i5, is ideal for live performances because their pickup patterns are very directional, resulting in less bleed from other instruments and amplifiers. ""Bleed"" is a term for sounds the mic picks up from the crowd or other instruments.
A SM58, which is traditionally used as a vocal mic, will work fine for a live saxophone performance, but you might experience some bleed from the side due to a wider pickup pattern.
You can also use a clip-on microphone. Many serious saxophone players and engineers have their own mic that clips onto the bell of the saxophone. This type of mic allows the musician to move about freely.;
, Place the microphone about 6 inches (15.2 cm) away from the bell of the saxophone, pointing down at a 45-degree angle.


When using a dynamic mic on a stand, the saxophone player has to be conscious of where the microphone is and play directly into it. Clip-on mics are a specific distance away from the bell at all times, depending on the model's clip size.

, Use your ear to adjust the sound.


You don't want the saxophone to be to abrasive and overpower the other instruments on stage. Saxophones tend to have a lot more high-mids and highs, so ""rolling off,"" or lowering, these frequencies may be beneficial.
You can also try adding a little low-mids around the 250 Hz range to achieve a more substantial, thicker tone. Adding some reverb can warm up the sound and tame some of its abrasive qualities.
You can also try adding compression if it's available. Compression will ensure that the saxophone can be heard consistently, especially if the player is very dynamic.

Look at Rini's wikipedia article.Study her character - how she looks, how she dresses, her personality.,
Try to figure out how you could make your own personality cuter, sweeter, and more innocent.,
Make sure you do the hair!,
Your clothing is important.,
Wear bright colours - Rini always stands out in the crowd.,
Since Rini is an anime and manga character, her skin always glows and she always looks in tip-top shape and really healthy.,
Make a 'makeup' decision'.,
Work hard and keep yourself cool.,
Understand that it's okay if not everyone is your friend.",How to Cosplay As Chibiusa (Rini),";
, Rini tends to accuse people of being a lot more immature than her, but everyone knows that she just says that to cover up the fact that she's an immature girl at heart! Being immature isn't a crime; but try not to over-do it. Here's a little guide to make your personality more like Rini's:


Don't swear. Rini never swears.
Your taste in music should be cute, but feisty(or just plain cute), like the song 'Sugar Baby' , an imitation of Eminem's 'Real Slim Shady'. This is Rini's song, sung by her. To check how your progress on becoming Rini is, compare yourself to this song.
Be innocent. Everyone knows that Rini is a little troublemaker, but hides it with her charm and cuteness to make people think she is completely innocent. This is quite a bad thing to do -- but, maybe you could tone it down a little? Let your charm shine, but be prepared to admit to serious bad things that you've done.
Rini's upbeat, extroverted and outgoing. A lot of girls are like this already; if you're not, try to get a bit more like that.
Rini is cute!! Or 'kawaii' as the Japanese put it. You should put that adorable little lisp in your voice and giggle a sweet little giggle. You MUST like pink and red and yellow. Bunnies are also a Rini-must. She's afraid of quite a lot of things - check them out on Wikipedia. Of course, you don't have to make yourself be scared of them. Rini is full of sugar and spice and everything nice!!

, The hair! We're finally on to the hair!! Rini's hair is pink and in big shiny bunches with two cones on top, representing bunny ears. Here are some hair tips:


You don't need to dye all of your hair bright pink. If you can, that's great, but if you can't/don't, you might want to consider getting pink streaks, or even just pink hair clips. Blonde hair is also quite Rini-like.
You don't need to do the complete hair-style, because the cones look almost impossible. You could just put your hair in big round bunches.
Keep your hair shiny and clean.

, Choose clothes that define your personality - in other words, clothes that are unique. Rini likes to wear pink, red and yellow, like a strawberry. Strawberry icons are a must.

, Mini-skirts and cute vest-tops are a must in the summer, and pink/white fake-fur coats are good for the winter. Rini wears a lot of ribbons and cute little pendants and kooky jewelry. Japanese characters/writing is great, especially in red. Last of all, your clothing should make a statement about YOU. Not your character!! Use Rini's style of clothing and adapt it into your own way of dressing. You'll get a unique, Rini-ish sense of fashion!

, Eat the right things and have a balanced diet to make your skin clear and fresh. Also, Rini isn't stick-thin. She's normal, really. Her face, arms and legs are maybe a little chubby in an oh-so-cute way, just to make her have more of an adorable character. Remember, to be like an anime character you don't have to have the exact shape! Don't make yourself super-chubby, because Rini's not like that!

, Rini doesn't wear make-up because she's just a little kid. If you feel like you need to wear make-up, make it natural and in safe, light colours.

, Rini has a goal to be a beautiful lady, and of course, help her mommy save the universe. Your goal might not be as major as that, but work hard on your ambition anyway. Rini does. She never gives up.

, Rini has her enemies: The Negaverse, the Negamoon, Queen Galaxia, all of the baddies from Sailor Moon. Everyone has someone that they don't like. But, Rini doesn't go and scream at them. She doesn't go and punch them in the face. She usually just fires her attacks at them, or, if she's about to die or something, she'd whisper, her eyes wide. You don't need to do either of these. Just breathe steadily, keep your cool, and try to work the problem out calmly. Rini would certainly not go and give bruises to the school bully. She'd just keep her distance from him. She'd make sure she was safe.

Given that you know the basics of saxophone playing, learn your major, minor, dominant 7th, and Pentatonic/Blues scales and arpeggios IN ALL 12 KEYS.,
After becoming comfortable in all twelve keys, learn how these scales and arpeggios fit into the twelve bar blues.,
Now that you've got some chord changes in your head, what are you going to do with them?,
Alright, now you have the scales, the chord changes, and the vocabulary; you just simply need to put it together.,
An extremely important aspect of Jazz is the conversation the soloist has with the rhythm section.,
Finally, be creative.",How to Improvise on the Saxophone," It is extremely important to be comfortable in all 12 keys (Not every song is in the key of C, G, or F). Although this may seem boring at first, it is the essential building blocks of improvisation(I bet John Coltrane and Charlie Parker were more than comfortable in all 12 keys).;
, Being the simplest and most common set of changes, the blues is essential for the beginning improviser. It might be easy to use only the blues scale for improvising on the blues, but don't you want more than one sound? Experiment with your scales over a play along cd--the most popular of these is the Jamey Aebersold series. After getting comfortable with the blues, start learning jazz standards. These are essential to any jazz musician looking for a job. You can purchase real books or fake books, or use the Aebersold books that come with the play along. When learning a tune, start with playing the scale in time along with the recording or a play along, then play your arpeggios. This should help with memorizing the changes so you can begin making music.

, Improvisation is quite literally composing on the spot, and it can be very intimidating in the heat of the moment. Listening to your favorite players improvise is a great way to get ideas--you can even transcribe(figure out for your own use) a cool lick you find in a solo and learn it in all twelve keys, and use it in your own soloing. Eventually, you will want to transcribe as much as you can to obtain a good vocabulary of jazz licks. This is the beginning to finding your own sound. Finding what you like about your favorite musicians will help you find your niche in music.

, You may find that you aren't playing well enough in time when you play passages of eighth notes or sixteenth notes or triplets. Work some time into your practice routine where you just play eighth notes with a metronome at a slow tempo in any given key or perhaps any given set of chord changes. Slowly speeding up your metronome will gradually put you right in the pocket, allowing you to play faster(but remember that the ability to play fast is not the ability to make a good solo, it is one of your tools to HELP your solo. You wouldn't want to throw a whole pepper shakers worth of pepper onto your food would you? It would overpower your meal as a whole. Use your fast technical stuff to spice up your solo, not to dominate it).

, You don't need to fill every beat with notes--give your audience some time to take in your last idea, and give your rhythm section some time to respond to you. Jazz is simply another language we use to communicate--and you wouldn't want to talk to someone who just talks and talks and never listens to you, would you? The same goes with jazz.

, Use different rhythms, syncopate, swing 8th notes to fit the style, build a sequence, repeat motifs, and just get into the music.

Choose a studio microphone.,
Position the microphone correctly.,
Choose the pickup pattern.",How to Mic a Saxophone2," In practice, this process is very much dependent on the mics your sound engineers have access to.


In general, you will want to use to use a large diaphragm condenser. Some high-end microphones include the Neumann U87, AKG C414, Mojave MA 200 and the Blue Bottle Rocket. Audio-Technical 4047, Shure KSM27 or a Rode NT1A are quality, affordable microphones that will produce good results, as well.
Some engineers like using ribbon microphones. But these are not only expensive, they are also at risk of being damaged due to the high SPLs that a saxophone produces.

,


Make sure the microphone is not too close to the bell. A general rule is that the mic should be about 3 feet (0.9 m) away from the bell, pointing down at a 45 degree angle between the player's bottom hand and the bell.
Don't center the mic over the bell. It's best if it is off-center by about 12 inches (30.5 cm), pointing inwards towards the instrument. This technique will produce a very rich, full sound even, if there is little room ambiance.
To achieve a larger, more open sound, move the microphone back and experiment until you achieve the desired sound.

, The standard cardioid pickup pattern is ideal for the studio. Some microphones allow you to switch the pickup pattern to a ""figure 8"" or an ""omni"" directional pattern. These patterns will capture the sound from the source and pick up room sound at the same time.

Stock the case, first, with the necessities to make noise come out of the instrument.,
Be sure to have the basic necessities to care for your saxophone.,
Be sure to be prepared for anything you may have to fix or replace on a moment's notice.,
If you wish, you can also keep a tuner/metronome in your case; you never know when you'll need one.

",How to Know What to Keep in a Saxophone Case,"



Reeds - it's best to have several on hand at any time as they don't last very long and can break or chip suddenly. They are best stored in a sturdy reed case with several reeds in it, as opposed to the individual plastic cases the reeds come in. To keep them in really good shape, you can even buy a nice case with a humidity insert to help your reeds last longer.

A ligature - You will most likely keep this on your mouthpiece when the instrument is stored, but you definitely need to make sure you always have it with you.

A neck strap - Unless you play the soprano sax (or something even smaller), or your saxophone is so tall that it sits on the floor, you will need a neck strap to be able to play comfortably. These are fairly cheap and attach to a hook on the back of the horn, and you will not be able to play the instrument without one.;
,



Cork grease - This comes in many forms, most commonly in a tube that looks like chapstick. It's used to grease the cork on the end of the neck of the saxophone so that the mouthpiece goes on easily and is secure.

A swab - This is a piece of cloth, probably colored silk, with a string attached to it that has a weight at the end. It is pulled through the instrument in order to remove spit. An alternative to a swab would be ""pad savers"", which look like big pipe cleaners. They are stored inside the saxophone instead of in the little storage compartment. You would have one for the body of the sax and smaller ones for the neck and mouthpiece, if you wish.

, Big problems should be dealt with by a repair shop, but sometimes simply fixing one screw can keep your instrument playable.



A screwdriver - Depending on the size of your sax, you will need either an extremely small one (made especially to fix your instrument, or you can use one that comes in an eyeglass repair kit), or a relatively small one that would be available at a hardware store. While you shouldn't try to do large-scale adjustments on your horn unless you've had the proper training, if you see a screw falling out, you can fix it yourself no matter where you are.

Teflon tape - This is usually used in plumbing, but it can also be useful for keeping the neck attached to the body of your saxophone if either piece is somehow damaged, a huge temperature difference causes the metal to change slightly and make the connection less snug, or if something happens to the screw that's supposed to keep them together. Some instruments can just be ""weird"", too, and have never quite fit together right. Now there's a fix for it. Teflon tape is not actually tape at all, and is easily applied and removed without leaving a residue.

Cigarette filter paper - Woodwind instruments, including saxophones, can not get wet. If the pads that seal the keys get wet, they can be seriously damaged to the point where they no longer seal the keys, which is expensive to fix. The best way to absorb water in the event that the sax does get wet is to use filter paper on each of the pads. A decent alternative to filter paper would be a (relatively clean) dollar bill, but many people feel that chemicals in them can harm your pads. Some places also sell paper that is specially designed to remove moisture from instruments.

If you have trouble with the higher notes, try saying ""q"" (queue) while still fingering low ""Bb""

, The higher the starting note, the more difficult it is to play the entire overtone range.

Be committed.,
Choose a type of saxophone.,
Do your research.,
Decide if you'll be going with a new or used instrument.,
If you are buying from a store, arrange an appointment (if necessary) to come in and play-test instruments.,
Buy your saxophone.,
Enjoy playing your new saxophone.

",How to Buy Your First Saxophone," If you're still unsure as to whether or not you're going to start playing, it's better to renting or borrowing before spending the money to own one. There's no reason to spend several hundred dollars on an instrument only to have it collect dust.;
, Beginners, especially in school programs, generally start on alto. Once you learn the alto, you can explore the Tenor, then the low tones of the Baritone or the high notes of the Soprano saxophones. Altos are the generally the cheapest and are a suitable size for all learners. They are also more common in performing ensembles. The tenor saxophone is larger and more expensive, but still fairly affordable. The Baritone saxophone is the biggest and most expensive of the common four (soprano, alto, tenor, baritone) with basic models costing over $5,000 and professional models costing over $7500. The soprano saxophone generally costs $2,000-$3500 for a basic model and $3500 and up for professional models.

, ""When in doubt, go with Yamaha."" Yamaha is known for making decent quality, affordable student models of most instruments. If you decide to purchase a Selmer Paris, make sure it is Selmer Paris not Selmer USA; they are completely different. Selmer Paris saxophones have a wreath in the logo, whereas Selmer USA says Selmer. Selmer USA has generic hard cases with there logo while Selmer Paris has a more soft case. There are also other brands that specialize in saxophones, such as Jupiter's 669 student alto saxophone, or Cannonball's beginner Alcazar models. You can research online, talk to saxophone-playing friends or relatives, or find a saxophone teacher and ask for their input. Shop around for prices, and consider buying used. Also, look for music stores in your area which may sell several different brands and types of saxophone.


If you can't get to a music store, you can also try shopping online, but it would be best not to go with eBay. If you do, be sure that you know what you're doing. Ask a more experienced saxophonist to take a look at the product you receive.

, Used saxes from a reputable store can be in great shape, but cost considerably less than new horns. Some stores offer ""levels"" of ""used-ness"", so you can get a really used instrument for a few hundred dollars, a slightly better one for a little more, and a gently used one for another hundred or so. Keep in mind that the most used ones might need more in repairs than you would spend on a slightly less used one, so try to go at least one ""level"" up from the worst of the bunch.

, Even if you have just started playing the instrument, play testing can't hurt, as you will be able to notice at least the worst of problems and you'll get a feel of which saxes ""feel"" best to you. If you want a second opinion, bring a more experienced player with you.

, Make sure that the sax either comes with, or you also buy, the following: a case, a neck, a mouthpiece, and a ligature (which will probably come with the horn), a neck strap, a swab, reeds, and method books. Your teacher or school may have specific requirements for these, so ask ahead of time!

Decide if you want to buy or rent your sax.,
Determine what kind of saxophone you want.,
Purchase or rent a well-known brand from a reputable music store.,
Buy the accessories you'll need to play.",How to Get Started with the Saxophone1," If you've never played before, consider your level of dedication and whether you plan on sticking it out for the long run. If you're just curious about the saxophone, then renting one from a reputable music store is cheaper and will ensure that it is in good working condition.However, long-term rental fees can become incredibly expensive, and the condition of a rented saxophone will be worse than buying a new one.The price of a new saxophone can range from $300 to over $3,000.If you are just starting off with the saxophone, buy a beginner sax that's less expensive before investing in a high-quality sax.;
, An alto or tenor sax are the best options for someone who is new to the saxophone. Alto saxophones are usually the starting point for most beginners because they require less air than the tenor, and have a smaller key scale which makes them easier to handle for young adults or children.Tenor saxophones are the most closely associated with jazz music.
The majority of classic music is written for the alto sax., A damaged saxophone won't produce a good sound and may cost you a lot of money in repairs. Make sure that you choose a reputable music store or saxophone shop in your area when you are looking to buy or rent. Avoid off-brand saxophones because you may have a hard time finding someone who can repair it in the future.


Some reputable brands include Keilwerth, Yamaha, Selmer, and Guardala.If you are still unsure about the brand, reach out to the music store and inquire about brands in your budget.
If you are purchasing a sax online, make sure there is a return policy or warranty.

, Other accessories that you'll need are a hard saxophone case, neck strap, extra reeds, cork grease, and music stand.The neck strap supports your horn and keeps it close to your body as you play. Reeds are necessary and can break easily, so it's a good idea to pick up extras. Cork grease is used to help move your mouthpiece on your sax, which will affect its pitch.Finally, the music stand enables you to sit sheet music upright, which is critical when playing a song.


Music stores will often offer a beginner saxophone with all the accessories included. Ask the salesperson if they offer these types of packages.

Identify all the parts of your saxophone.,
Put your reed in your mouth.,
Attach the mouthpiece to the neck of your saxophone.,
Slide your reed onto your mouthpiece.,
Slide the ligature over the reed.,
Attach the body of your sax to your neck strap.,
Attach the neck to the top of the body and tighten the screws.",How to Get Started with the Saxophone2," Before you assemble your saxophone, you need to be able to identify all of the parts. The main parts of the sax are the body, neck, mouthpiece, reed, and ligature.Your reed goes in your mouthpiece and is the part of the saxophone you blow into to play it.
The neck of your sax is the part that connects to the mouthpiece and to the main body of your saxophone.
The body of your saxophone is the large part that contains all the buttons you hold in order to play different notes.
The ligature is a metal sheath that fits over your mouthpiece and keeps your reed in place.
While you assemble your saxophone, refrain from pushing or pulling on parts because they may bend.

, Your reed needs to be wet when you play the saxophone. As you start to assemble your saxophone, keep your reed in your mouth to put the required moisture on it.You can also practice blowing through your reed as you put together your saxophone.

, Slide the mouthpiece about halfway over the cork. Make sure that the open side of the neck and mouthpiece are both facing up.You may need cork grease to slide the mouthpiece over the cork.A twisting motion may also help you attach the mouthpiece., Gently push the reed onto the mouthpiece, so the top of the reed and the top of the mouthpiece meet each other. It's important that your reed is wet, or it won't hold in place.

, Handle the ligature with care and make sure not to damage the tip of your reed. Slide the ligature over the reed and position it towards the bottom of the reed. Tighten the screws to hold the reed in place., Take the body of the saxophone and thread your neck strap through the hook on the back of the saxophone.You should hold the saxophone on the bottom with your dominant hand to keep it in place as you do this.

, Carefully twist the neck into the hole on the top of the body of your saxophone. After the neck is secure and facing towards your mouth, tighten the screws.There may be a plug in the top, so take that out first if you have one."

Learn how to read music.,
Take music lessons or join a band.,
Listen to professional saxophone music.",How to Get Started with the Saxophone3," Your right hand goes on the bottom of the saxophone with your fingers resting on three white buttons. Your thumb sits on a thumb rest closest to you.Your other hand rests on the top of the saxophone with your thumb on the thumb rest and your fingers rest on the three large buttons on the top.You will typically have a total of 5 buttons on the top. You rest your fingers on the larger ones or ones that have indents. Skip the very top button, which is usually smaller than the other ones.
Hold your saxophone close to you so that you have full control over it.
Practice stretching your fingers to the other buttons on the saxophone to build finger dexterity.

, Curl your bottom lip over your teeth and put your mouth halfway over the reed. To get the best sound you want to seal your lips to the mouthpiece when you blow.Make sure to keep in mind that air can escape from the side of your mouth as well.

, Notes on a saxophone are comprised of open and closed keys that are performed by holding down buttons on your instrument.If you want to read off sheet music or play with a band, it's important that you study and memorize a key chart, so you know which buttons to hold down.


A C note is played by holding down the large middle button on the top of your saxophone., To learn classic saxophone music or play with other musicians you'll need to learn sheet music. Sheet music is comprised of notes arranged on five lines called the staff. Sheet music will also designate the register in the form of the treble clef or bass clef, as well as the beats per minute in a song.


Notes on the lines in higher registers from top to bottom are, F, D, G, B, and E.
Notes in between the lines in lower registers on the staff from top to bottom are, E, C, A, and F., The best way to learn how to play saxophone is to take lessons from an instructor who can show you how to play. An instructor will be able to teach you music theory and can give you tips on how to improve your personal performance.

, To get a better understanding for what your saxophone should sound like, listen to professional saxophone music. The more you listen to different styles of saxophone music, the easier it will be for you play by ear.


Some of the best sax musicians include Sam Rivers, Joe Henderson, and John Coltrane."
"
Just because you have a case, it doesn't necessarily guarantee your saxophone will be safe.,
Therefore, always put your case down lightly and with care.

,
Try hard not to knock your case on anything as you walk from place.

,
If you are yet to buy a case, consider what you need.",How to Carry a Saxophone Safely1," Indeed, it will be quite likely you will be more aggressive, or careless, with it, because you believe you don't need to protect it as much. Depending on the hardiness of your case, this is, to a certain extent, true, but if you don't treat it with respect at all, it is extremely likely to break because of you.;
,,, Softer cases are usually cheaper- but, naturally, softer, and therefore it would be much safer to buy a harder one. Question whether you need a hard case for your purposes.

One of the best ways to carry your saxophone is to carry it by the horn, wrapping your hand around it with your right hand and supporting your sax with your left hand.

,
However, if you are wearing your neck strap, it is often safer to keep it on your neck strap and hold it away from you, so it does not knock against you and break the reed.

,
Always wear the mouthpiece cover when not playing.,
It is not a good idea to carry it by the thumb rest.,
Care for it as much, or more, than you would with a case according to the steps above.,
Buy a sax stand.",How to Carry a Saxophone Safely2,",, This protects the reed, which is vital if you are about to play.

, This puts a lot of pressure on your thumb, and doing this often will also weaken the thumb rest.It will also tire your right hand in general, and this will make it harder to play.

, Take care not to knock against anything as you carry, put it down lightly etc.

, This supports the whole weight of the saxophone, and doesn't put any of the saxophone's anatomy at risk.

Reassemble your saxophone.",How to Clean a Saxophone," Most saxophone cleaning kits come with a brush or cloth on a long string with a weight on the opposite end. Put the weighted end into the bell of the saxophone and turn the sax upside down. Bring the weighted end through the body and come out the narrow end. Gently pull the swab through the body several times.Swabbing helps dry the interior so that pads are not damaged, inhibits bacteria growth, and removes any build-up of foreign particles from foods, beverages or saliva in the instrument.It is not unusual to see a slight green color on the pad after a few passes. This is normal and does not indicate rust or metal damage.;
, Insert a flexible swab through the larger base opening on the neck, coming out on the narrow side to which the cork is attached. Brush out the inside thoroughly to remove any foreign particles.


You can run water through the neck as well — just be sure that no water comes in contact with the cork, or it may swell and deform.Soaking with vinegar or brushing with detergent can help get rid of excess build-up., If available, these are helpful for removing any residual moisture. Make sure to use them after swabbing. Insert the pad saver through the body's narrow end. Let it absorb moisture for a few seconds, then remove.Some manufacturers make similar items such as ""bell brushes"" or ""neck savers"" for other parts of the saxophone. These are fine to use similarly if you have them, but not necessary for regular saxophone maintenance.

, Check for sticky pads as you play the saxophone, and visually inspect under the pads for any wear and tear. Use wet cotton swabs or a thin piece of paper to clean where the pads meet the tone, removing any sticky residue. A little clean water should be enough to do the job., You'll want to clean the mouthpiece often, as it comes into contact with your mouth. Start out by removing the reed, then use a mouthpiece brush to remove any residue inside the mouthpiece. You can substitute a bottle brush or even a small toothbrush. Run cold or lukewarm water through the mouthpiece, then pull a clean, lint-free cloth through the mouthpiece to dry and remove any particles missed by the brush.Soaking in antiseptic mouthwash or detergent is helpful for particularly dirty mouthpieces., If you'd like to save a rubber or resin mouthpiece with light marks, use sandpaper or a fingernail sanding block. Start with the coarsest grit to remove the scratch. Progress to increasingly fine grits to smooth the mouthpiece out., The warm air you blow into it contains saliva, which provides a moist place for bacterial and fungal growth as well as food particles that damage the instrument.Wipe it down thoroughly after each use with a clean towel or cotten swab. This will stop bacteria and chemicals from congealing., Soak especially dirty mouthpieces in water and a small amount of detergent or malt vinegar.Reeds can be soaked briefly in antibacterial liquids such as alcohol, mouthwash, or mild hydrogen peroxide.Allow the reed to dry before re-using., You can use just a brass lacquer polishing cloth.If desired, add a small amount of spray furniture wax.Avoid washclothes, paper towels and any cleaning product not specifically made for brass instrument care., You can safely tighten loose rod screws, but be careful not to over-torque them., Specialty swabs, pad savers and bell brushes can be washed lightly by hand with a small amount of soap. Each should last years if cleaned regularly., It should look, feel, and play beautifully! When in doubt, consult a professional.

These concepts are essential to music and the kinds of pieces you’ll be playing in a performance setting. Once you become familiar and proficient in your scales, you’ll start to recognize patterns in your sheet music that’ll look just like scale exercises and you will have a much easier time playing them after extensively practicing your scales.


It can be boring, but it’s your job to make it fun! Play scale exercises in challenging octaves, borrow/purchase scale exercise books with entertaining etudes.
Once you can play your scales and scale exercises in every possible octave, evenly, and at high speeds, you’ll find challenging runs in your music a piece of cake.

, Once you know what needs improvement, all you need is persistence. After practicing your scales, do not hesitate to spend large amounts of time on what needs work. If it’s a difficult passage in a piece of music, count and sing it out. Use your metronome and play the excerpt at a slower tempo. Once you’re proficient at that tempo, speed it up by about 5 clicks and continue until you reach the desired tempo.


It’s okay to get frustrated; that just means your desire for improvement is strong and that ambition will help you get there. Make sure to also briefly go over your strengths; after all, you don't want to lose them!

, For many, the lowest and highest notes of the range of the sax are unfamiliar. To improve your ability to play the whole range well, you have to keep at it. Scales that can be played in multiple octaves really help with this. A fun exercise for fingering the higher and lower notes quickly is to play a velocity type exercise.


For fun, you can start on the low Bb (on alto), then play the next note up chromatically and come back down, go up again adding another note on top, and then come back down. It would read something like this: Bb-B-Bb-B-C-B-Bb-B-C-C#-C-B-Bb etc.
This can also be applied to the upper octave. Remember that playing the exercise evenly is more important than playing it quickly. Quality over speed.

, You could be the best musician technically, playing the hardest passages at incredible speeds, but without good tone, it all goes to waste. In the best bands, tone is valued above all else. As a saxophonist playing classical music, the saxophone sound isn’t always desired. You may often be asked to sound either like a clarinet or French horn. Long tones are the most effective method of developing your sound in this way.


It’s easiest to play a chromatic scale and hold out every note for an extended amount of time. For starters, hold it out for maybe 5 seconds. As you develop your skills, hold it for as long as possible, and you’ll find that you’ll also be improving your lung capacity!
A big factor in your tone is your embouchure (or the way your mouth is placed around the mouthpiece). Embouchure can make or break your playing. Make sure you understand how to achieve a good embouchure.
You may find that once you can “whistle backwards” and apply it on the mouthpiece, you’re set. Whether you can whistle backwards or not, make sure you play with your best tone at all times and you’ll improve in no time.

, When you’re bogged down by drab scales, it can be tempting to break into your sexy sax man persona, belting and thrusting “Careless Whisper”, but it’s important to consider how goof-offs will affect your skills. You can joke around every once in a while, but if you play with poor tone or technique, remember that practice makes for permanence. Make sure not to learn bad habits if you can avoid it. Just take a break instead.


On the reverse side, if your lips are quivering with excruciating pain and you’re feeling weak, then maybe it’s time to put the sax down and drink some water, crazy. Know your limits and know when to take a break!
Sometimes it’s good to practice while doing other things, like during commercials while watching TV. It might seem a little weird, but you won’t become bored or burn out from concentrated practice.

, If you’re a beginner, try to practice as much as you can. Your lips will begin to hurt if you’re applying a good embouchure that you’re not used to. Take it easy and progress in a way that works for you. As a casual student, it’s important to maintain what skills you have acquired.


That means at least half an hour a day of practice. It might seem like too much, but there’s so much to practice! Half an hour barely allows you enough time to go over everything you need to know.
If you feel ready, gradually increase your practice time each day and simultaneously increase your endurance until you feel you’ve reached a convenient amount of practice time that suits your lifestyle. Just remember that it’s vital to practice every day, even if it’s just for five minutes. After all, “for every day you don’t practice, you lose three days of practice!""

, Technology can improve your musicianship immensely! Metronomes and tuners are a must and should be with you and turned on whenever you practice. There is an endless amount of iPhone apps that you can use.


For a metronome, tuner, and tone generator, you can try the Tonal Energy Tuner; it's not free, but worth it. There are plenty of other (free) tuner apps out there as well as apps that will help you with ear training, sight reading, and rhythms! You just have to explore and find what works for you.

Sterilize the neck.",How to Clean a Saxophone Mouthpiece," Loosen the ligament, then remove the mouthpiece, its reed, and the saxophone’s neck. You’re going to want to clean these parts often since they come in contact with your mouth. The reed is the part of the mouthpiece that produces sound from vibration and is sensitive to bacteria, fungus, heat, and pressure.;
, The warm air you blow into it contains saliva, which provides a moist place for bacterial and fungal growth as well as food particles that damage the instrument.A reed that is cleaned often requires at least a wipe down with a clean, dry towel or specialized swab after every use. This will stop bacteria and chemicals from congealing.Specialized swabs and brushes for saxophone cleaning can be bought at music stores or online.

, A wipe will only remove the immediate moisture. To kill germs and prevent buildup, a more thorough cleaning is recommended.


At least once a week, soak the reed in a cup of two caps of vinegar and three caps warm water for 30 minutes. Afterwards, rinse the reed with warm water to remove the vinegar., Any moisture can reintroduce bacteria when it is sealed inside the saxophone case. Place it on a paper towel. After about 15 minutes, replace the paper towel and flip the reed. Once it is completely dry, store it in a reed bag inside your saxophone’s case., Once a month, or weekly, if the saxophone is used daily, remove the mouthpiece and begin treatment. Saliva collects in the mouthpiece, causing buildup of a substance called limescale that affects the sound and makes the mouthpiece difficult to remove., If the limescale has thickened, an acidic substance such as vinegar or hydrogen peroxide works for the purpose of removal. Exposure to these acids can hasten discoloration, though, so you may wish to brush off the limescale by hand if possible.With a vinegar of 4-6% acidity, soak two cotton wads. Let the first rest on the window of the mouthpiece. After ten minutes, remove it and gently rub off the limescale with the second. Repeat a second time for tough cases.
With hydrogen peroxide, submerge the mouthpiece for two hours. The chemical will begin to dissolve the limescale on its own.

, Avoid hot water and harsh detergents, as these both damage the instrument. A gentle detergent and lukewarm water is enough to remove vinegar, eliminate most bacteria, and still allow you to get at the limescale., This can be done with a small toothbrush or a specialty mouthpiece bottlebrush.Specialized swabs can be pulled from the neck and through the mouthpiece on a string. This offers some bacterial and saliva removal, but a more thorough cleaning is recommended., Sterisol is a germicide readily available for use on instruments, but bathing the mouthpiece in household mouthwash for a few minutes is also effective. This step is not mandatory but is useful in eliminating any leftover bacteria.

, This will prevent the mouthpiece from reintroducing dampness that allows bacteria to grow. Once all moisture is gone, store it in the saxophone case.

, Saliva and build up collect in the neck. Put the swab in the bell and then pull it through the neck on a string., This is the same process you used on the mouthpiece, requiring warm water, soap or detergent, and a bottlebrush or toothbrush to be used weekly.


Dip the brush into the warm, soapy water and use it to attack the limescale. Rinse out the remainder under a faucet with lukewarm water., Again, this is optional, as the soap and water takes care of the bacteria well enough. Any leftover bacteria or odor can be finished with certainty here.


Pour Sterisol germicide into the neck so that it coats the inside. Let it dry in a clean place on a paper towel for a minute, then rinse it under lukewarm water. Either let it air dry or dry it by hand with a swab or towel before storing.Vinegar can be used here, too. After loosening the limescale with soap, water, and brushing, stop the mouthpiece with a cork. Surface cover any holes, prop the neck upright, then add either cold or lukewarm vinegar. After 30 minutes, rinse out the vinegar with soap and warm water, then dry it in air or by hand."

Keep practicing.",How to Play the Alto Saxophone," You probably want to borrow or rent one from a school or music store unless you're absolutely sure you're going to stick with the instrument. Many beginners prefer models like the Yamaha student alto (YAS-23), or a Conn New Wonder that has been overhauled but on a beginner level, but anything available from a respectable source like Sam Ashe or eBay should work. The best way to find a saxophone that's right for you is to go to a saxophone warehouse where you can try them out to see which is best for you. You'll also need the following accessories, if they don't already come with the instrument:



A mouthpiece Don't buy the cheapest one available, but don't splurge on a professional one yet, especially if you may not even stick with the instrument. You'll probably want one made of plastic or hard rubber.
Claude Lakey 6*3 Original, Meyer 5, Selmer C* and S-90 series are still popular with instructors and all levels of players from beginners to professionals. Many other brands offer good beginner mouthpieces as well. The Yamaha 4C is also popular.
Generally, a good hard rubber mouthpiece will run around $100-150 US. When starting off don't worry about getting a good mouthpiece, a decent student model will suffice.
Metal mouthpieces are not suggested for beginners. The worst mistake a beginner can make is to buy an expensive mouthpiece because of advertising, including endorsements by the pros. Preference in mouthpieces is very personal. What a professional like Dave Koz uses might not be suitable for a beginner or novice player. Unfortunately, you just have to try a bunch to find something you like and metal mouthpieces are expensive!
To find the best mouthpiece for you, do some research. Learn what the shapes and sizes do to the response and sound. Large bore mouthpieces react differently than smaller bore ones. This is easier to understand after you've played both kinds. Some mouthpieces are made to achieve certain tonal qualities, and if you don't know what you are looking for yet, you should look for mouthpieces which do not lean too far into the classical and jazz, or dark and bright genres. Rousseau, Selmer, Vandoren and Meyer all make good products.



A ligature, if not included with the horn/mouthpiece. The ligature is the device that holds the reed to the mouthpiece. A metal one is fine. Some performers prefer the sound of a leather ligature, but these cost more than the metal ones.

Reeds: As a beginner, you'll probably want to experiment with reeds a bit, but start with anything between a 1.5 to a 2.5, which shouldn't be too easy nor too hard to get a sound with and should produce a decent tone. Good brands to start with are Rico and Vandoren.

Neck strap: Alto saxes aren't usually back-breaking, but you'll need something to help support it while you play. Neck straps come in a variety of styles, and you should choose the one that's most comfortable for you.

Swab: A swab is a piece of fabric (often silk) on a long string with a weight on the end that is pulled through the instrument to remove moisture that has ended up in the horn from playing.

Fingering chart: A fingering chart shows how to play all the notes in the range of the instrument, and you'll want to have one when learning to play.

Method book(s): While not required by any means, if you're learning on your own or would like some extra help, they are an excellent investment.;
, Attach the neck (the short, slightly curved piece that's angled wider than 45') to the top of the body of the instrument (the part with all the keys), which is the smaller end of the body and secure with the neck screw which is right next to the top of the body. Remember that your octave key (the long triangular thing along the top of the neck) is sensitive; take care when assembling the neck. Place the wooden reed on the mouthpiece so you can see a very tiny bit of the mouthpiece showing up top. Place the ligature (the small, open metal cylinder) with the screws on the side on the mouthpiece over the reed. If it doesn't seem to fit, turn it upside down and try again. You should be able to see the screws when you're putting it on. Attach your neck strap to the loop on the back of the instrument, put it around your neck, and stand up., Your left hand should be on the top and your right hand should be on the bottom. Your right thumb goes under the curved thumb rest towards the bottom of the instrument. Your right index, middle, and ring fingers go on the mother of pearl keys that should be easy to find. Your pinky will move the other keys at the bottom of the sax. Your left thumb should go on the round piece at the top of the instrument. You will see five mother of pearl keys at the top. Your index finger goes on the second one down, and your middle and ring fingers go on the fourth and fifth, respectively.

, There are many different variations of embouchure. Beginners are sometimes taught to curl both lips over their teeth (like grandpa). Most people curl their lower lip over their bottom teeth slightly, and rest their top teeth on the top of the mouthpiece. Some people even press firmly with their lips without curling them over their teeth. Each method produces different tone quality. Play around with what works for you. It's important to make a good, firm seal around the mouthpiece, so that when you blow the air goes through the instrument and not out the corners of your mouth. However, the embouchure does not have to be extremely tight.

, If you've done this right, you'll hear a C# (concert E). If you're not getting a sound or you're making a squeaking noise, adjust your embouchure until the tone improves. You may need to put more or less of the mouthpiece inside your mouth. You can also try playing just the mouthpiece: it's sometimes easier to make your first sound with just the mouthpiece. Then just do the same thing with the mouthpiece on the neck!

,


Press the second mother of pearl key down with your left middle finger, leaving the others uncovered. This produces a C (concert Eb).
Press the first mother of pearl key down with your left index finger. This produces a B (concert D).
Press down the first and second mother of pearl keys. This produces an A (concert C).
Continue covering more holes, going down the scale. Three covered is a G, four is an F, five is an E, and six is a D (concert pitches Bb, Ab, G, and F). You may have a little trouble with the lower notes at first, but it'll improve with practice.
Add the octave key (the metal key above your left thumb) to any of these fingerings to produce the same note, but an octave higher.
With the help of a fingering chart, move on to altissimo (really high) and really low notes in the range, as well as flat and sharp notes. In time, you will be able to play every note your saxophone can reach from bottom Bb up to top F#.

, If you're learning for a school band, you'll definitely get something to learn from there. Otherwise, visit a music store to buy sheet music and/or method books to begin to play from. Once you get more advanced, it's fun to buy books with pop songs that you recognise, or to play along with a CD.

, With a lot of hard work and dedication, you'll get better and better at playing. You can branch out into all kinds of specific types of music, especially jazz.

Set your tuner to “A.” If you have a designated rehearsal space, or don’t mind lugging an extra piece of equipment around, purchase a standalone digital tuner.,
Play the A note.,
Play an F#.,
Move on to other notes.,
Play scales.",How to Tune a Saxophone1," Otherwise, download a tuning app to your smartphone. Once you are ready to test your sax, select concert note A to begin tuning.If your tuner or app doesn’t have any presets for specific notes, tune it to to a frequency of 440 hertz (Hz) for concert A.If possible, purchase or download a tuner specifically for saxophones. Most others are meant for the piano or guitar. Because those instruments are in a different key than saxophones, a standard tuner may read your sax’s notes incorrectly. For example, an A note played on an alto or baritone sax may read as a C on your tuner, while the same note played on a tenor or soprano may read as a G.Tuning apps for saxophones include Cleartune (iPad) and Easy Saxophone (Android).;
, Watch the needle on the tuner. Aim to make it stay exactly in the middle of the display for as long as you sustain the note. If the needle indicates that your note is either too flat or sharp by falling to the left or right, adjust your mouthpiece accordingly, roughly one millimeter at a time, and try again. Repeat as needed.If your note is too sharp, pull your mouthpiece out along the neck cork.
If your note is too flat, push your mouthpiece farther in along the neck cork.

, Once your A note is in tune, test your F# (F sharp). These two notes are the easiest to tune on the saxophone. Start off with this easy pair before moving on to ones that may need more coaxing. Use the same technique of adjusting your mouthpiece to correct sharpness and flatness.A tuner meant for piano or guitar may read your F# as an A if you are playing an alto or baritone, while an F# on a tenor or saxophone may read as an E.
F# = 370 hertz (Hz)., Once you have a handle on A and F#, continue the process with other notes. Alter your embouchure (the way you apply your mouth to the mouthpiece) to play notes sharper or flatter. Add more pressure to make a note flatter. Loosen your mouth’s grip to make it sharper.Run through the notes again once you have them all properly tuned. Close your eyes and listen to each one as you play. Develop your ear so you’re less dependent on the tuner.
Mouthpiece designs vary greatly, so even if you master your embouchure on one mouthpiece, those same techniques may not work on the next.Play with the way you set your lips, chin, and posture until you settle upon a combination that seems to work.

, Start with the lowest note in the scale. Work your way up to the highest and then work your way back down. Aim to alter your embouchure as little as possible while still coaxing out the correct notes. Keep an ear out for notes that consistently sound wrong no matter what you do, which may indicate a problem with your sax.If your saxophone isn’t giving you any trouble, repeat scales with your eyes closed to further develop your ear, since relying on your tuner while playing scales, long notes, and arrangements will work against you in the long run."

Use the right mouthpiece.,
Be consistent.,
Check the temperature.,
Check your sax’s age.,
Adapt to your sax.",How to Tune a Saxophone2," Mouthpieces vary in design. Make sure your saxophone is compatible with the mouthpiece, since older saxes may not work well with more modern mouthpieces. Check the baffle, the size of the chamber, and the width of the tip, all of which may effect your sound. Baffles in particular make a tremendous difference in sound,so sample various kinds to find the right one for you.



Straight baffles are known for their steady sound. They are ideal for older saxophones and sopranos.

Roll-over baffles, which are popular with jazz players, add a bit of a bang with growl effects and a suggestion of brightness at the beginning of a note, while still maintaining a loud, steady sound throughout.

Step baffles may be the easiest barrel to work with. Their ability to project sound makes them popular with R&B and rock performers, who have to pierce through a lot of other noise in order to be heard over their bandmates.

Concave baffles lack projection and are hard to hear unless you’re right up close. Because of this, they're hardly ever used except to produce very specific effects.

, Choose a type of reed to play with: hard or soft. If you are a beginner, consider using a soft reed. Although they tend to produce flat sounds at first, you will have an easier time manipulating the sound between sharp and flat than you would with a hard reed. Whichever one you choose, stick to it, since switching from one to the other will result in drastic changes in sound.Along the same lines, if you tend to use a lot of vibrato when you play, be sure to add vibrato when you tune your sax, as well.

, The colder the sax, the flatter the sound. If your sax has been stored in a cold area, move it somewhere warm so it can reach room temperature before you start tuning. If you don’t have time for it to warm up on its own, use your body heat and blow warm air through it.Be sure the whole sax is of an even temperature. The top of the sax may feel warm over time, thanks to the body heat from your hands and fingers, while the base remains cold. If the temperature between top and bottom is inconsistent, play long notes to circulate warm air throughout the whole instrument.

, If it refuses to play the correct notes no matter what adjustments you make to the mouthpiece or your embouchure, find out how old it is if you don’t already know. Low-pitch saxes are considered standard these days, but before that was established, manufacturers made high-pitch saxes as well. Unfortunately, there is nothing you can do to tune the latter precisely to other, more modern instruments.If you are unable to find out for yourself as to whether your older sax is high- or low-pitch, bring it into a music store. A repairman should be able to tell the difference, as well as repair the sax if it turns out to be a standard low-pitch model that simply isn’t working right.

, Saxophones are known to be very temperamental in terms of tuning, since the slightest imperfection or deviation in design can alter its sound. Relax. Strive less for perfection and more for proficiency with each individual sax. If one or more notes sound incredibly off, take it in for repairs to make sure everything’s where it should be. Otherwise, alter your technique to produce the right notes (or close enough) rather than stubbornly demand your sax to work the way you want it to.Rest assured that you’re in good company even if you can’t quite coax perfect notes from your sax. Several jazz legends famously had the same trouble.

Of course, if you really struggle in school, then you may just not be able to imitate Light Yagami in this area.

, Exercise regularly and keep yourself fit and healthy. Try sports like tennis such as Light did, or try other sports like polo, swimming, horse-back riding, etc. Light wasn't the sort of person who would intentionally get dirty, so sports like football or rugby might not be what he would do.

, Light said himself that less sleep would dramatically affect his concentration and performance.

, When your health declines, so does your thinking power.

, Don't let any situation get the better of you. Even if you are panicking inside, try not to show it on the outside.

, The pre-Kira Light would never think of bending people like Kira did, but he possessed the power nonetheless.

, Try to make your own out of an old notebook or see if you can buy one online. Choose whether you want the title to be written in Latin characters or katakana.

, The best way to know how to imitate Light is simply to rewatch the anime.

Try to get a tea with matcha infused in it. Matcha is a Japanese green paste that is used in traditional Japanese tea.

Hook the neck strap into the small loop on the back of the saxophone's body, below the octave key.",How to Assemble a Saxophone," You only need to put the thin side in your mouth, but be very careful. Moistening both ends will stop the reed from warping (bending). Also make sure not to cut your mouth as reeds sometimes have sharp edges, especially new ones.;
, Make sure the hook is hanging at the front.

, You can get this at a music store, they look like tubes of chapstick.

, Take the reed out of your mouth and place its flat side on the flat part of the mouthpiece. The thin, curved end of the reed should line up with the thin end of the mouthpiece. Leave a small amount of room in between.

, Make sure that the wider end of the ligature slides on first to match the shape of the mouthpiece. The screws should be on the thick bottom part of the reed, facing you. Tighten the ligature.

, If it's difficult to slide on, do not add cork grease. This a problem amongst beginners, the grease will act as glue and make small particles stick to it and when the neck goes on the body and the neck is twisted, the particles may act like sandpaper and do more damage. The best way is to use a bit of tissue and clean both contact points until they are dry and dust free. The neck should go on very easily.

, Picking up your horn by the upper body can cause damage to the mechanisms that make your horn work properly.

,


Do not force the neck on and be careful to not damage the octave key (on body or neck) when assembling.

, The last step is to have fun playing!! And remember practice makes perfect!

Get the clothes.,
Style your hair.,
Do the face.,
Pay attention to your posture.,
Lose the attitude.,
Learn his habits.",How to Cosplay Death Note Characters1," To start off your Lawliet cosplay, you will need a basic pair of blue jeans and a plain white, long sleeved shirt that doesn't have too tight a neckline, and is basically round cut. V-neck shirts will not work properly if you wish to be L. The jeans can vary, as long as they fit your body comfortably with the waist band resting just above your hips or in that general area.;
, If your hair does not qualify to suit L at the black and ragged shoulder length cut with bangs, you have two options. One, you can cut and dye your hair, or two, you can buy a wig. With either option, the hair you need must be black, and slightly longer on the left than it is on the right. Not too much difference, only about a half inch to an inch or so. Keep the parting of the hairline to the left and the bangs in the front over your eyes. Make sure you can still see though, because L doesn't walk into stuff.

, As everyone knows, L has black bags under his eyes. It is not suggested that you stay up for long periods of time to obtain these bags, but rather get black eyeliner and smudge it under your eyes to give the appearance of bags. Try to avoid sparkly makeup. Also, if you have prominently dark brows, try an eyebrow pencil in a slightly lighter shade to help make them less prominent. L practically has no eyebrows. Also, if you have a uni-brow, it is highly suggested that you pluck or wax it.

, To obtain L's posture while walking, try to be slouched and always look at the ground. Walk like you have back problems and can't quite stand up straight. Keep your hands in your pockets, but only while walking or standing. When sitting, sit in an almost crouched position with your hands resting palms down on your knees. Again, keep slouched, even in the chair.

, L is very passive and doesn't have many strong emotions to exclaim to the world, so to be L, you have to keep your emotions in check. Only smile slightly when you are pleased about something, and if someone insults you, just be passive or respond with a question regarding the insult. Do not take offense. If you do, do not show it in any way. They're just words, there's no need to get all upset over them.

, L has a few habits that make him especially unique. To be L, try to make a point of chewing on your thumbnail and touching your lips often. Lawliet also itches his right leg with his left foot, while standing. It takes practice to get it right. To pick things up, use a maximum of three fingers unless it can't be avoided (example; cell phone, book, paper. He writes with holding the eraser side of a pencil or marker, but most people can't do this and write fancy too.) both hands right in front of your face. Remember, L eats a lot of sweets and strawberries, but try not to get too carried away with that, because you could get a stomach ache or a cavity.

, It should be white but any colour is fine. It shouldn't have anything written, drawn, or made on it. Nothing.

, They should be denim-styled and a faded blue. Keep them a bit loose but not too loose! They shouldn't fall off! Also, despite them being loose, try not to appear overweight. L as a character stated that using his brain keeps him thin. It's a fine line, but as long as you keep it natural, it's totally fine.

, Only wear a pair of white sneakers if you're going outside. Don't wear socks either (he dislikes socks).

, This means no accessories! No watches, rings, bracelets or anything like that! Keep it simple and only wear the items mentioned above.

, Whenever you find yourself in a seated position, start noticing the different things happening around you. This is for work that may require detail.

, If someone asks why you're sitting like that or why are you so weird, just tell them it's your way of doing things.

, Be it small snacks like chocolate, a piece of cake or coffee. Or even just eat sugar cubes straight-up.


When eating cake with strawberry on it, (it seems to be his favorite) finish the cake first before eating the strawberry.
Drink sweetened coffee (adding milk is optional) often but make sure it's not too much caffeine for you! Black tea is acceptable too, but make sure you add a few sugar cubes.

, You can also hold a book/Death Note upside down only if you can read it upside down.

, Don't raise your voice until it's something unexpected.

,, Put one foot on the other and keep doing it with both of your feet. In other words, rub one foot on top of the other.

, If someone asks you your name, say ""You can call me L"" (it helps if your name has a significant ""L"" in your name such as the first, middle, or last letter of your name).

, You can darken your eyes with eye makeup.

, While using it, sit in the same position and if possible, place it on the floor.


Be rather secretive about your laptop; this means have a secure password and general protection from prying eyes.

, Call him Watari. It can also be a sibling who's interested.

, L hates losing, no matter how small the contest. Be very suspicious by nature.

, This can go from stacking up sugar cubes or other sweets and eating the wrapper along with the rice cake (maybe L didn't want to get his hand dirty?). Be able to knot a cherry stem with your tongue. Another fun thing you could do would be to make origami with the wrappers of your sweets (although this was not something that L is seen doing).

Get the clothes To be Light Yagami, there are several clothing options you can make, the most common being the white shirt with a red tie and a brown coat.,
Style your hair.,
Do the face.,
Pay attention to your posture Light stands up straight and never slouches.",How to Cosplay Death Note Characters2," Pants may vary according to what you can find, but keep them as a more dressy pant like the pants from a suit. Always make sure you look preppy and fresh from the dryer. Light doesn't wear wrinkled or dirty clothing.

, Light's hair is a simple style. If you don't already have short brown hair, again, there are two options. One, cut it, or two, buy a wig. For either option you must make sure that the hair is a medium to light brown colour with possible red tints to it, and the cut must be even all around. It has the appearance of slightly messy, but is still well kept and tidy, just as everything else Light owns.

, Light's face is simple. Clear of blemishes and flaw free, but that doesn't mean you have to be that way entirely. Light is seemingly flawless in how he presents himself, but as long as you don't have any obscene amounts of makeup or facial tattoo's you should be good to go. Basically, just have a clean face.

, He's completely different from L, so remember your posture!

"
"
Get down your appearance.,
Get down your personality.,
Have pride.,
Be intelligent.,
Be crazy.,
Always have a plan.,
Be confident but cautious.,
Be independent.,
Try to be quiet and reserved, yet have the necessary social skills to get you around in any circle.",How to Cosplay As Light from Death Note," Light is particular in that he looks calm and collected, almost all the time. Choose a mellow hairstyle. Try to make your face look calm most of the time too, not angry but not particularly happy either. Also become fit and maintain a BMI (Body Mass Index) of 16.7 to 17.0. It's essential that you do not go below 16.7 or above 17.0 range, as you will not be athletically fit if you do so.;
, You'll have to be capable of constantly thinking of the most intelligent decision (that is, the decision that will get you the desired result.) Never leave anything unaccounted for, and try to always be in control (but do not show it. Bragging or revealing yourself to be a leader isn't good, it attracts attention.) If you intend to be KIRA, you'll also have to be capable of deceit. Get used to doing things that are morally wrong for the sake of ""the greater good."" Also, don't feel sorry about what you've done, even if it's eliminating people*. They were obstacles. You'll have to be the exact opposite, however, if you want to be just Light. Never do anything morally wrong, for any reason. Look out for anyone around you, even if you don't like them.

, Although it may be contradictory to step 2, you do still have your pride. When given the choice, go for the win. Also, don't accept losing, ever. If you lose, make sure you intend to get even. Naturally, don't show that you're flustered or angry, but feel perfectly fine with wrath. Get even later(secretly, of course, or in a way where nobody can link what you've done to you specifically (i.e. an alibi)) If you're going to be just Light though, express your pride openly (never deceive or manipulate!) and maybe even get violent when someone deals a grave hurt to your pride (just enough to get your point across, never aim to maim, just snap some sense into who you're talking to.)

, Remember how Light got perfect scores on his entrance exam to To-Oh? What about all the plans he made that went off so well? Your reasoning, knowledge and judgment must all be in peak condition, and you must be able to know yourself and anyone around you exceptionally well. Predict the actions of others and of yourself in both real and hypothetical situations. Increase your ability to do math and Try to gain more charisma. Having a wide array of abilities at your disposal is also quite good. Furthermore, also train the mind. Try to solve puzzles and chess games. (i.e. hacking, Light can hack*.)

, Light has his moments of insanity (or rather, KIRA does, but you get the point.) Learn to do an incredibly creepy smile. Also, learn to chuckle and sneer without looking stupid. Let's face it, most people with an evil laugh sound stupid when they do it, but Light doesn't. This goes in with his charisma. However, if you plan on being only Light and not KIRA, learn how to make your eyes shine. This helps with charisma too, but in a sort of a different way (and this has nothing to do with insanity, but instead persuasion. I'm putting this here so that you understand the difference between Light+KIRA and Light.)

, Light plans every move he does extensively, making sure that there are never any gaps in anything he might plan. It's always good to have a backup plan as well, just in case the first goes wrong.

, Remember the precautions Light took to find out whether anyone ever went into his room or not? Even before he found the Death Note, Light still would slip the piece of paper between the door, and place the lead on top of the door as well. And the thing he did with the handle as well? Genius. It may not seem like much, but it was. Always take these types of precautions for anything. This shows that you're always prepared, no matter what.

, Light is only dependent on someone once he's sure he's manipulated them enough to actually trust them. Everyone is human, so we all make mistakes. But Light can't afford any.

, Try to also be easygoing when around people, yet provide insightful comments. Above all, think before you speak your mind or act.

Apply mascara onto your eyelashes and/or smear some eye shadow under your eyes.

,
If you're not going outside, don't wear any shoes.",How to Cosplay As L Death Note," You will have to make the wig more messy and crazy after it comes. Suggested places to buy your black wig is eBay. Otherwise, you could probably find one in the stores.


Alternatively, if your hairstyle is similar to L's, you could also just dye your hair black. Use temporary dye if you don't want to walk around with black hair for longer than a couple of days.;
,, Buy one at Walmart, Target, etc. They shouldn't be expensive at all.

Get a black wig that preferably goes down to your lower to mid neck and barely touches your neck.,
Get a baggy pair of blue jeans.,
Find a long sleeve, baggy shirt.,

It should look similar to that of a ""L"" wig but less messy. Also make sure the wig is comfortable and fits with out being excessively itchy.;
, Make sure they are worn and a pale shade of blue especially around the knees. Make sure you can move freely and that your bottom isn't hanging out.

, In the book, he wears a clean white one, but it's not uncommon to wear a black one or a bloody white one. It's all up to you if you want people to know your BB then go with the black or bloody one. Chances are that if you wear a clean white long sleeve shirt, people will mistake you for L. Try wear a shirt 2 sizes bigger or more than your normal size, but don't let it be revealing.

,, Dark non-sparkly eyeshadow works too.

,, And always have an extra jar with you.

, If you don't have pale skin, make-up is an alternative.

,, If you're not then baggy clothes will help.

Pick a name for yourself.,
Have an addiction to fruit.,
Get shinigami eyes.,
Figure out what your shinigami looks like.,
Round up some supplies.,
Write Shinigam-ish.,
Adhere to the shinigami customs.,
Hang out with other shinigami.,
Have fun and be realistic!",How to Become a Death Note Shinigami (Cosplay)," Every shinigami goes by an exotic name. It's the only way for other shinigami, or even humans, to identify you. Try using Japanese adjectives to give your name a unique, shinigami-esque sound, while describing your personality. Try names such as Daku (dark) or Kandaina (generous) to comply with your shinigami's tastes. If you want, make up your own words!;
, The most well-known shinigami, Ryuk, always had a taste for red apples in the human world. Other shinigami, such as Midora, also seem to take a liking to humans' fruits. In her case, bananas. Try picking your favorite fruit, and be sure to pick one that you wouldn't mind eating very often. Shinigami that are addicted to fruit, as Ryuk explains, experience withdrawal symptoms if they don't eat that fruit in a while.

, Okay, so you don't actually have to get shinigami eyes, you just have to pretend you have them. Wear contacts to change your eye color to red, yellow, or maybe even purple. The purpose of shinigami eyes is to see the full name and remaining lifespan of a human, to enable a shinigami to write that human's name in their death note and thus extend their own lifespans. However, be warned that shinigami eyes do not work on death note users or other shinigami, so if you're cosplaying alongside a death note user or shinigami, be careful as to not acknowledge the fact that you can use your eyes on them-because you can't.

, All shinigami look different. They can take on an almost human shape, such as Ryuk, or even a completely odd and non-humanoid form such as in the case of Nu. Some shinigami may even meet in the middle, having almost an even split between human and non-human features, such as Sidoh. This is the aspect of creating a shinigami OC where you have the most freedom, because shinigami can look very different from each other. Start by drawing some various designs and pick your favorite to develop on. Keep in mind that all shinigami have wings, and it's up to you to decide how you want them to look.

, You're going to need quite the assortment of supplies to make your vision of becoming a shinigami come to life, er, un-life. To begin, a death note is for certain required by all means! Without a death note, a shinigami has no means to survive whatsoever. You're also going to need costume materials to make yourself look like a shinigami, including the contact lenses mentioned in step #3. The amount of costume accessories and materials needed varies, depending on the complexity of your shinigami's design. For wings, try wrapping fabric around a wire rig, but letting it hang freely at the bottom.

, Although some shinigami are able to read, write, and speak human languages fluently, all shinigami understand the shinigami's basic alphabet. This language is what is written on Misa Amane's death note, due to the fact that her shinigami, Rem, has difficulty writing Japanese. It is not expected that you would actually understand this fictional language, but writing in various scribbles may give the impression of a foreign alphabet.

, Believe it or not, the shinigami do have a strict code of law, enforced by the King of Death and Armonia Justin Beyondormason. Death Note Wiki can provide a good look into the shinigami's rules as well as the typical behavior of a god of death. Some shinigami choose to disobey the typical customs proper for a shinigami, such as apathy and content, but it's rare to find a shinigami willing to break the rules set for them. If these laws are disobeyed, shinigami may be punished on a 9-1 rank, with 9 being the weakest form of punishment, and 1 being the most severe. Any rank from 3-1 will result in the shinigami's death.

, Or maybe even a human! Have a shinigami get together and decorate your house like the shinigami realm. Invite your friends, tell them to dress as their shinigami OC! Going to anime conventions as an OC is never recommended, but it can be attempted by anyone willing to do so.

, Remember, this is only cosplay. You will not ever become a shinigami or a killer! But warnings aside

,
Have a love for apples.",How to Act Like Ryuk from Death Note," Ryuk has a rebellious way of dressing. He wears completely black, including several chains and studs. If you want to dress like him modestly, you could incorporate black, grey, navy, dark purple, and other dark colors into your wardrobe. He also wears black boots, which you could wear too. If you don't want to wear boots, especially in hotter weather, try wearing combat boots, flats, flip flops, or even black Converse or Vans, if you wanted. Footwear isn't crucial as long as it's in Ryuk's color scheme.


Wear a lot of black. Find a way to make it look as if your shirt is sewn into your skin.;
, You could wear multiple belts, like Ryuk. Wear dark colored skinny jeans, patterned leggings, or even leather leggings or pants. Wear black skirts with ripped up black tights or pantyhose underneath.

When dressing like Ryuk, keep in mind that anything that's dark-colored goes.

, Ryuk wears a lot of metal, like his earring. Wear some chains and a heart attached to a chain on your left ear.

, It pulls the whole thing together.

, Make up is key. Since most people aren't born with blue skin, you'll need a lot of blue makeup to get the look you want (that's not even starting with the lips or eyes). It's best if someone helps you with it.

, Unless you want to go for his look at the end of the series (in which case, buy some blank contacts), Ryuk's eyes are necessary. They're haunting to someone who stares into them, like a Shinigami should be.

, Since you've read or watched Death Note, you probably have noticed that Ryuk doesn't care much about Light Yagami, correct? After all, Ryuk is a Death God and he doesn't care much about humans or their opinion of him or other shinigamis. If you wish to act like Ryuk, it's best if you adopt an ""I don't care"" attitude. Wear what you want, do whatever you want, and so on and so forth. Ryuk is creepy and doesn't play for any sides.


Ryuk doesn't truly care about Light. While Light digs his own grave, Ryuk sits back and watches. For example, if someone were to spread stupid rumours about you, just laugh it off and carry on. That's what Ryuk would do. He doesn't dwell on dumb stuff that has no effect on him. In addition to your ""I don't give a damn"" attitude, however do give a damn about friends, family, your grades in school, etc.

, Ryuk is very opinionated, sarcastic, and snarky. Keep in mind that some people don't like these qualities in a person. Yet, some do. Try cracking dry humour jokes. If someone is doing something wrong, give them your opinion on how they can do better or try harder. Being opinionated doesn't mean acting like an ass to people. Think of it as a ""friendly suggestion."", Last but not least, Ryuk is loyal. True, he isn't fond of humans or of Light, but he remains loyal to him. He wouldn't necessarily risk his life for Light, as Rem, Misa's Shinigami did. For an example, he told Light that Raye Pen-bar was following him. He also was willing to help Light Yagami find out Raye's ' real name when Ryuk followed through Light's plan during the bus jacking.


Follow around a guy who acts like Light. Talk to him and tell him how to work the Death Note.

,, Like the other characters of Death Note, Ryuk has strange habits. For one, Ryuk is addicted to apples. He complains the apples in the Shinigami Realm are dry and disgusting. If you want to establish your addiction to apples, always be snacking on an apple or apple slices.


Ryuk's second ""habit"" is he goes through withdrawal if he doesn't eat an apple. Become irritable and loopy if you don't eat one for sometime. But don't make yourself or others miserable around you, and don't make yourself look like an idiot. Be slightly loopy and irritable, yet enough so others will comprehend that it's apples that cause you to become that way.
Eat apples all the time. Say, ""It's worth going to the human world for these apples."" or something along the lines. Pretend to go through withdrawal symptoms if you can't eat apples.

(Optional, but recommended) Get an InuYasha.",How to Act Like Kikyou from Inuyasha," Kikyou NEVER becomes wild or shows out unless she is very upset (which is rare). If you do become angry, calm down and curse under your breath.;
, You could also try going to Academy (the store) and buy a few arrows and a bow. Also, Kikyou is shown as being quick and able to sense bad things, so build up your endurance and sixth sense.

, Kikyou wears red hakama pants and a white kosode. You can buy these from eBay, CosplayMagic, etc. Or you can be adventurous and make your own. The designs are simple and you can find patterns from folkwear.com. Kikyou goes barefoot, but plain sandals are fine too.

, If your hair is fairly a dark enough brown that's fine too! Hair extensions are good if it would take a very long time for you to grow you hair. Or a good wig will do wonders.

, In other words, a loose ponytail with a white bow to hold it in place. If needed, a little hairspray to keep flying hair in place.

, Kikyou has a cool, collected personality, and therefore tends to stay away from doing unnecessary things. She's precise in her ideas and does not waver. Neither should you.

, Kikyou LOVES children and heals the elderly. A way you can be kind is to help the old lady carry her bags, visit an animal shelter, be polite to adults, and give friendly smiles to young children. Your InuYasha will be impressed :)

, As you may know, Kikyou wears no (known) makeup. In the first episodes Kikyou is seen putting on lipstain/colored lipgloss so you can put lipgloss on. A little eyeliner and foundation to hide blemishes and you're done!

, Talk in a low yet loud enough to hear tone of voice. Kikyou is not one to raise her voice unless yelling at InuYasha or being mean (which is seldom shown). If upset, raise your voice to a clipped tone and try to use words/phrases like her such as 'insolent, fiend, fool, idiotic, damn you to the fiery pits of hell, is that all you have to say, etc.' Don't be too mean, but let the person you're talking to know you don't care enough about them to argue for hours. Also, be blunt if asked your opinion.

, This is a bit tricky, but don't worry! Steps 1, 6, and 7 will help for just the the batter of this cake, but you're going to need the icing. The icing is; being cold. Kikyou is stoic and unreadable almost all throughout the series. She is also very mysterious to most people, as she is the undead but looks alive.

, Doesn't really matter who plays as hum, as long as you know him and can interact with him and keep a level head and way of thinking. You could also substitute with a Naraku and have fun battles all over the place. But this is all optional. Kikyou is often a lone wolf, so going it alone is okay too.

Emulate L's obsession with sweets.,
Be open about yourself as a human being.,
Increase your understanding of human emotions.,
Practice facial expressions.,
Practice vocal delivery, and tone of voice.,
Try to remain unaffected by others' opinions.,
Look into martial arts.,
Be in shape.",How to Act Like L Lawliet (from Death Note)," It may almost seem impossible but you have to try.;
, Most articles demand the use of the same clothes, hair and, well, everything L wore/looked like in the series. Since everyone lives in different areas, from terribly cold (where they wear jackets most of the time) to awfully hot (warm clothing may result in heat strokes!), the costumes etc are not always achievable.


Wear whatever you're comfortable in. Whatever suits you. It doesn't have to be exact, but exact is an option. Suggestions include a tee shirt and sweats, or something that will blend into your surroundings. To be realistic, if you were L you'd want to blend in. So, if it's fancy, wear something fancy.
Choose a natural color for your hair. If you must have some color in your hair, use black. Blue is the color that represents L in the anime to contrast Light's red, however, his hair is black and messy.
Don't do anything exhausting to achieve bags under your eyes. Get your rest. You're not all like L as you do need sleep to maintain your deduction skills.

, Even though L is almost superhuman in intelligence, try to achieve a broader topic of knowledge. The more you know, the smarter you'll seem. Being in school is one way to seem smart, as well as get smart. At least know what each precise word you say means. Also, correcting grammar and punctuation as well as spelling really doesn't hurt. The easier you make this for yourself, the more easily you will be perceived as smart.

, Experiencing L's typical stress level (when you have too much on your shoulders, such as oh the Kira case) will give you aging lines, acne, and other skin and/or body disorders. It's important to pay attention to these things. You need to know when to just slow down and relax. L is never stressed, so it shouldn't show in any way upon you.

, L is a Forensic Psychologist as well as a lead homicide detective. In order to seem like someone important to the world, one must have a background knowledge in the subjects relating to that person. You can find a good online set of lessons in basic Psychology for free. The things you can learn from programs are phenomenal. Plus, if you are looking to pursue a career as something like L's, it's great to be ahead of your studies. A background in law is also a good thing.

, If this is uncomfortable to you, either shift your weight to your butt instead of your feet like L does, or find some other odd way of sitting. Just sit however you find comfortable and make it your own.

, L walks in a very slumped and bent over manner. You can achieve this by sitting over a keyboard your entire life, or you can just pretend. It takes a lot of effort to remember full time to slump over. It also takes at least a month to train yourself to slump full time. The easiest, and best thing for your back and neck is to not do it at all, but develop some other odd way of walking. L is an individual. No one else is like him. Consequently, be yourself.

, L is constantly informed of everything. You can give others the same impression by being friends with everyone on a social networking site. You can also follow or ask to receive email updates from any important website like your local news website, court records or anything else that might report something worthy of an L-replicated mind's knowing. Try to check everything out twice a day.

, That makes it seem like you never slept. The Task Force Investigators said so themselves that they have never seen L sleep. That is near impossible in some households, though. Consider sleeping on a different time zone, the one behind whichever time zone you are in. Like L, keep that a secret.

, Have a sweet tooth if you like. Eat your sweets when everyone is watching. If you like, to make more of an impression, bring sugar cubes with you and eat them like candy. If you are doing this part, tone it down a bit. If this kind of behavior affects your health negatively, or you don't like sweets, find a food you like and eat it all the time.

, L will talk about someone with his own personal experience. His reasoning seems to serve to make his theories of someone's behavior more believable, or better yet explain it. When Light is looking at the porn magazine, L notes that he did strange things like that when he was young. Back to how he said he was childish and he didn't like to lose. He was very open to telling everyone that, treating his experiences as a warning to others.

, Meaning, you must look at someone with trouble, from their point of view. Try to understand how they feel, without pouring your entire heart into it. Emotionally L is a very stable, calm person. The idea of not connecting your emotions to everything will be easier and easier with time.

, L's most common one is a bored face. He has no smile, big, black eyes. Watch his face next time you see the anime. Grab a mirror and try replicating them without looking like a freak. L never looks - well, that's not true, everyone has their moments.

, L's voice is very quiet and soothing. He enjoys bringing attention to him so that his point will come across smoothly, plainly and without needing to rephrase or repeat. L is a significantly lazy person, as a person alone. He has a servant (Watari, though his service is voluntary) and always gets what he wants, no questions asked. You must master the same effect with tone of voice, body language and bargaining.

, If someone says you are weird, do not let it get to you. L has a low tolerance for being wrong. He remains calm on the outside, but on the inside, he resents the fact you might have been right. He is, in this way, very childish. So when someone tells you you're weird, pretend to take it into consideration with a blank face.

, When Light punched L in the face for being depressed, L kicked Light straight in the face claiming ""either way, an eye for an eye"". L knows martial arts to protect himself. You need some basic defense courses as well. In the final manga it was stated that L was a master at Capoeira; that may be a good martial art to look into. As much as you won't believe it, some people dislike smart people. Be ready, someone might lash out physically or mentally at you. Have your weapons on guard!

, Even though L doesn't look like it, he is actually pretty athletic.

Get pants that match.,
Wear a pair of black dress shoes - preferably wingtips.,
Don't forget his hat (which is, again, optional).,
If you want, you could also wear a tie or cravat.,
Make sure you have a scarf.,
Gather his (many) accessories.,
Add a wig or style your hair like this.,
You're done.",How to Dress Like the Doctor from Doctor Who4," He dressed as a bohemian man with a long scarf and a large personality. Look at his unique dress style and decide what season costume you want.

, For his first season, you'll need a red blazer or red Levi denim jacket. Either one works well. You'll also need elbow patches (preferably black or brown). For his second season (season 13), you'll need either a brown duffel coat or a replica from hellocosplay.com. It's the exact same thing for seasons 14 and 15. In seasons 16 and 17, you'll need a long brown wool trench coat . For season 18, you'll need a burgundy trench coat that goes to your ankles.

, Tom Baker also wore vests, pullovers, and waistcoats in his 7 year run. For season 12 he wore an argyle v-neck cardigan in brown and red, with white diamonds on it. In seasons 13-16 he wore a yellow tartan waistcoat with a little bit of red or brown in places. In season 17 he did wear a waistcoat but it was unbuttoned, so if you are going for this look you could easily go without one. In season 18, he wore a burgundy coloured waistcoat with a paisley pattern.

, For seasons 12-17 he wore a pair of baggy grey tweed trousers. An accurate substitute would be a pair of dark gray open-bottomed track pants (make sure there is no logo on it, or you take it off somehow). Alternatively, a pair of grey jeans will work nicely. In season 18, he wore burgundy coloured pants (I'd recommend some sort of dress trousers, or chinos). In seasons 12-17, he held his pants up with black braces, and in season 18, the pants fit well around his waist. However, he still held them up with black clip on braces with an x shaped back.

, He also sometimes wore a pair of riding boots instead., The Fourth Doctor also wore three different hats. He mostly wore a brown wide-brimmed fedora (like the ones in those 1930s detective movies). Sometimes, he wore a green/brown fedora with a wide brim and a dark brown band. In season 18, he wore a burgundy colored wide-brimmed fedora.In the story 'The Terror of The Zygons' he wears a balmoral (a certain type of Scottish hat) instead of his usual fedora (in this story, he also wore a tartan scarf, which was equally as long as his regular one)

, In season 12, he wore a green, white and blacked stripe necktie (which was not tucked into his cardigan), seasons 13 and 14 he wore a cravat usually in orange, blue or burgundy. In season 15 he wore a conventional necktie for the first time in burgundy, with dark blue polka dots. Season 16 he wore a white cravat tucked into his shirt, and in seasons 17 and 18 he went open neck with no tie or cravat., This accessory, along with the coat and pants will either make or break your costume. For an accurate scarf, find the pattern for your scarf and begin knitting. Each season had a different length for the scarf. In seasons 12 and 13, the scarf was 12 feet (3.7 m) long. In season 14, his scarf was 13 feet (4.0 m) long. In season15, the scarf was about 15 feet (4.6 m) long. In seasons 16 and 17, the scarf was over 19 feet (5.8 m) long. By season 18, the scarf had grown to about 24 feet (7.3 m) long! Take this into account when you knit your scarf. If you just want an affordable scarf, try the scarf from the Elope costume company.

, You'll need a sonic screwdriver and a white paper bag full of Jelly Babies (or a suitable substitute). Optional accessories include a small telescope, a solid blue yo-yo, and some poker cards.

, For the hair, you'll need a brown afro. However, if you wear the hat the whole time, this won't be necessary.

, Now go have fun, because ""There's no point in being grown-up if you can't be childish some times."" - Tom Baker (Robot, 1974)

Try out Peter Davison's look.,
Get a coat like his.,
Add a jumper.,
Be prepared to sew the pants.,
Get a slim fitting white dress shirt.,
Wear some braces beneath the jumper (the button on variety).,
Get the shoes.,
Top it off with a panama hat - specifically, an optimo colonial panama style hat.,
Accessorize.,
You're done!",How to Dress Like the Doctor from Doctor Who5," His costume is very Edwardian and easy on the eye. It also gets the ladies. Take notes, gentlemen.

, His coat was a beige colored frock coat with red piping on the edges of his lapel, the outside of his pockets and around the cuffs.

, Davison also wore a white cricket jumper. Make sure you get it with red/navy trim near the opening, the cuffs and around the bottom of the jumper. The pattern was different in season 21 to seasons 19 and 20. However, in some stories he would wear a white waistcoat with a paisley pattern, however the jumper is more recognisable. If you plan on wearing this in hot weather, it would be advisable to get a vest instead (sleeveless jumper).

, They are a pretty unique beige and red pinstripe design, so you may need to get creative and make them from scratch. However, if you are pressed for time or money, you could get away with a pair of khakis or chinos with red pinstripes (you could easily apply these with fabric paint).

, You'll need to put question marks on the collar (one on each side). Depending upon the season or episode, the question marks look different. Again, these can be painted on with fabric paint (or take the shirt to a tailor). Look at the different serials and choose which style you like the best. He also had the piece of fabric behind the buttons coloured red, as well as the inside of his collar and the underside of his collar, although in season 21 the underside of the collar and the button placket changed to a medium green colour.

, Remember to colour the fasteners brown and put question marks on the straps and look at ""Planet of Fire"" for the correct pattern. However, should you be wearing the jumper the whole time, these won't be necessary.

, Davison wore white cricket trainers. If you can't find an exact match, try white Chuck Taylors/converse.

, It could be rolled up and put inside his pocket, and it was sexy enough to get the ladies.

, An important part of his costume is the signature celery in the lapel. You'll need to get a stick of fake celery and pin it to your lapel. You could use real celery, but you'll need to take it out to water it every now and then (also, it could stain your coat a little bit).


Really the only other accessory you'll need the Sonic screwdriver (even though he didn't use it very often, as it was destroyed very early in his run and wasn't seen again until the 1996 movie).

, Go off and be adventurous, and remember ""Dreams are important. Never underestimate them."" - The Fifth Doctor (Terminus, 1982)

Travel.,
If you set your mind to something, don't give up on it.,
Make your own rules.,
Get his swagger down.,
Finally, get his look.,
Find a companion and protect your pal.",How to Act Like The Eleventh Doctor," The eleventh doctor is a little bit quirkier than the tenth doctor so act a little quirky and random. For example, in the middle of a conversation say some completely random fact or reveal an interesting piece of information.;
, Know a little bit about everything, especially science history and math. Learn phrases in different languages. Use a big vocabulary. Of course, this all means you'll need to read a lot––and widely!

, The Doctor stands by his friends through thick and thin. Be someone who listens and cares, and also be someone who learns from your mistakes with friends and do your best to patch things up when needed.

, Never stay in the same place. The Doctor hates staying in one spot for to long. Develop your wanderlust by visiting nearby towns and cities, then going further afield until you're traveling to other countries.


Learn to travel on a budget. The Doctor isn't about being a travel snob, he's all about the experience and about learning all you can about other cultures. Again, read widely; travel novels and stories are a good place to start, such as Eat, Pray, Love by Elizabeth Gilbert.

, Being persistent is a trait of the eleventh Doctor, even when it seems like he's stopped pondering something, it's often still bubbling away underneath everything.

, Doctor Who often winces at the conformity of those who are sticklers for the rules and regulations that have long outlived their usefulness. Be a sensible thinker when it comes to rule making and breaking.

, This Doctor usually walks with very long strides. He is flexible and comfortable with his style, so like him, stand tall and straight and look people in the eye.

, You can buy the suspenders, tweed jacket and bow tie. Or, you could wear button-up shirts and overcoats ( not trench coats). Matt Smith also wears his hair parted in the right but you don't have to be a mirror image of him; a hairstyle that suits you and isn't the latest fad is a good choice.

, Don't assume that your companion is helpless though. The Doctor is all about uncovering the hidden strengths and brilliance in everyone.

His waistcoat changed in the Trial of a Time Lord chapter ""Terror of the Vervoids"".

, For the hair, you'll need a blonde afro.

, You'll just need to throw something together like a DIY weapon. You'll also need a sonic lance like the one from Attack of the Cybermen, Remember, ""What's the use of a good quote if you can't change it?"" -Sixth Doctor (The Two Doctors, 1985).

With the season 24/25 costume, remember to wear a necktie, preferably in red with a blue pattern on it.,
He wore a hat that was very similar to the Fifth Doctor's, but with a smaller and upturned brim.,
You're done.",How to Dress Like the Doctor from Doctor Who7," Take a look at his comical sense of style.

, McCoy wore two different jackets. In seasons 24 and 25 he wore a light grey colored blazer with two buttons. In season 27 and the 1996 TV movie, he wore a dark brown two-button blazer. He also wore a silk scarf beneath the jacket lapels (you could easily find a replica one online).

,, It shouldn't be slim fitting and the arms should be slightly baggy.

, Sylvester McCoy wore a vest in the TV series and a waistcoat in the 1996 TV movie. In the TV series it was his signature question mark pullover and in the movie he wore a red paisley single breasted waistcoat with no question marks whatsoever.

, You'll need McCoy's signature umbrella. You'll also need a pair of spoons cut down to resemble the ones from the show.

, In season 26, however, to reflect the darker tone of the show he wore a dark brown one - again, with a pattern on it. A pocket square would also be appropriate, with a similar pattern to the tie. You could easily use it as a hatband also., If you plan on making both costumes you could easily get two uses out of the same hat - however, for the Seventh Doctor's costume, remember to turn the brim up as well., ""There are worlds out there where the sky is burning, and the sea's asleep, and the rivers dream; people made of smoke and cities made of song.

Try the ""Night of the Doctor"" look.,
Accessorize.,
You're done!",How to Dress Like the Doctor from Doctor Who8," He was definitely the most handsome of the classic series Doctors, and dressed very well too. You can find his costume online, or if you want to put it together yourself, you'll need navy pants and a beige double breasted waistcoat, with a darker, long jacket. A fob watch would not go astray either.

, For the hair, you'll either need to grow really long, sexy hair and curl it, or get a rockstar style wig.

, If you want to dress like the Doctor from the Big Finish Audio series Dark Eyes, first off you need to listen to it. It's awesome, and secondly, you'll need a leather pea coat, with gold colored buttons.


Next in the Dark Eyes costume, you'll need a white crew neck t-shirt. Any white crew neck shirt will work as long as it has no graphics on it.
Get some well fitted black jeans.
Add a bag You'll need a brown messenger bag with a shoulder strap. Even an Indiana Jones bag could work easily.
If you have short hair, you're good.

, For the ""Night of the Doctor"" costume, you'll need to dress very similarly to the 1996 movie costume.


You'll need a green frock coat (preferably single-breasted but double-breasted works too)
For the belt, you'll need a regular old brown belt. You should cut it appropriately and add an S-link chain for the buckle.
You'll need beige colored pants (khakis work).
Brown boot spats/gaiters are also required, as this Doctor has a more steampunk look.

, You'll need a sonic screwdriver. Character Options has recently released a replica of the Eighth Doctor sonic for a fairly reasonable price. For the Dark Eyes sonic, you'll need to build your own as there are no replicas or models for sale - however, should you be desperate, you could simply use the Character Options replica.

, However, khakis are recommended.

, You should get them in brown suede. Amazon is a good place to get these

, It may sound silly, but it's the most accurate thing you can find at an affordable price. Tie it accordingly like they did in ""Day of the Doctor."" However, there is a replica at Magnoli Clothiers - however, it is rather expensive.

, You'll need to have it in the sort of sticky-uppy style (not unlike David Tennant's). If you don't feel like dying it white, you can always buy a wig and dye that.

, For fake ones, go on Amazon and search for rapper goatee. you should dye it white like the hair.

, Any brown leather bandolier works as long as it can hold a sonic screwdriver.

,, If you're dead-set on accuracy, get some prosthetic make up (like the kind for the Hartnell costume).

, It should have big lapels and go down to the top of the hips.

, Black jeans or work trousers will do the job just nicely.

, You'll need a burgundy, navy blue, dark purple, black, or forest green long sleeve v-neck t-shirt, with a reasonably small v (in the show, he actually wore a jumper, but a t-shirt works equally as well).

, Then all you need is a quirky personality and you're done.

Take a look at David Tennant's dress sense.,
Get either a blue or brown pinstripe suit with four buttons (preferably blue pinstripes for the brown suit, and rust pinstripes for the blue suit).,
Add a tie - the different ones he had varied, so you have a few choices.,
Add a shirt.,
Get the right shoes.,
Style your hair just right.,
Alternatively, if you have a black tie event you are attending and would like to dress like the Tenth Doctor, I'd suggest getting a black, single button tuxedo with notch lapels, and wearing a white dress shirt with a black bow tie and black high top converse/Chuck Taylors (with a white sole, laces and stitching).,
Amp it up with accessories.,
You're done.",How to Dress Like the Doctor from Doctor Who11," A suit, a tie, and sandshoes. He's the charming bloke in a tight suit who taught me how to get the ladies.

, You'll need to make this suit tight on you. Only allow about one or two inches of space when sizing it. For example, if you've got a size 36"" chest, you need a 38"" chest on your suit. He never buttoned all four buttons, usually two or three - except in the two part story 'Silence in The Library/Forest of The Dead', which was with the blue suit.

, You basically want something thin, in a colour palette of blue and either brown or burgundy (for the brown or blue suit respectively), and not overly patterned. Alternatively, you could go without one - if you're going to go this route, spread the collar over your jacket lapel. An undershirt would complete the open neck look.

, He always wore slim fitting shirts. With the brown suit, he usually wore solid dark blue or light blue coloured dress shirts (he has also worn a light grey, tan, and brown shirt on occasion) (his dark blue shirts are not navy, as navy blue is far darker than the dark blue shirts he wears). With the blue suit, he wore either wine, dark burgundy, or light blue coloured dress shirts. It should be noted he never wore a white dress shirt with his pinstripe suits, as Louise Paige, the costume designer for David's whole run, felt that white was a very high contrast, given the nature of his suits, so if it looks white (such as in a promotional image), it's actually a very light blue.

, With the brown suit, he wore cream (not white!!!) Chuck Taylors (they looked like they were falling apart a little bit, so try to give them that look, or actually beat up a pair of Chucks). With the blue suit, he wore maroon (again, not red!!!) Chuck Taylors (These were also kind of dirty and beaten up). However, in the episodes 'Fear Her', 'Love and Monsters', 'Rise of The Cybermen' and 'The Impossible Planet', he wore black converse with his brown suit.

, The hair is a little bit messy. Try for a fringe, or the more common sticking up hairstyle.

, The bow tie was quite wide on the ends (more so than in the middle) and was self tie, however a pre tied works just as well. He wore this outfit in the episodes ""Voyage Of The Damned"", ""The Lazarus Experiment"", and ""Rise Of The Cybermen/The Age of Steel."", This guy has more accessories than Tom Baker! You'll need a pair of 3-D glasses (from the episode ""Doomsday""), a clear green plastic water pistol (from ""The Fires of Pompeii""), a weird ""Timey-wimey"" detector (from ""Blink""), a pair of rectangular plastic frame glasses (like the kind hipsters use), psychic paper (multiple episodes), and a sonic screwdriver.

Start with the hair for Matt Smith.,
Put together his series 5 look, if desired.,
Copy his series 6 look, if you prefer.,
Mix it up with a series 7 look, if you want.,
If you want to find a cheap suit for the 11th Doctor, go to Value Village.,
Add a hat.,
You're done.",How to Dress Like the Doctor from Doctor Who12," You'll need to have long hair. Your hair should come down to about the tip of your nose. You need to wash your hair with shampoo and conditioner. After that, on a cool setting, you need to dry your hair with a hair dryer and brush it with a round brush as you do that. After that's done, and your hair's still a tiny bit wet, use straighteners to straighten your hair. After this, apply product to your hair. Only use a little bit. After that, use industrial strength hairspray. You should use the hairspray upside down so it gets in your roots. Then, put everything in place and spray, then you're done with that.

,


Get the right jacket. You'll need a brown tweed blazer with two-button closure.It's a good idea to check thrift stores for a match.
Add the shirt. The shirt is an expensive one. You could try a regular slim fit dress shirt in either burgundy or cerulean depending on which bow tie you're planning to wear (in series 5, the shirt matched the bow tie and braces).
Use black slim fitting dress pants or black jeans.
Try to get matching x-back braces and a bow tie. These either come in burgundy or blue. In series 5, the bow tie was a pre tied variety.
Try your best to match the boots. The boots are All-saints layer boots. If you can find a cheaper alternative, go for it. Black Doc Martens work nicely - however, they look like they are beaten up and dirtied, so I'd recommend going for that look.
Get a brass wrist-watch, with the face on the inside of your wrist. It completes the series five costume.

, You'll need to start with his iconic brown tartan jacket, with elbow patches. Alternatively, you could get the green coat he wore in ""Let's Kill Hitler"", ""The Girl Who Waited"", ""Closing Time"", and ""The Wedding of River Song"". It works for those extra cold days.


The shirts are all in shades of sky blue with white buttons, or white, with a check pattern on the white shirts, and still all fit relatively tight and slim.
There are more bow ties, in either burgundy, blue with a horizontal bark pattern, or an Aztec key pattern bow tie. The bow ties are usually self-tie, so learn how to tie a bow tie. There are links to the series 6 bow ties in the tips section.
You can take liberties with the boots as long as they're black, however make sure they are clean. Not necessarily shiny, but the whole series 6 outfit was a lot more put together than the series 5 costume.

, In series 7, the Doctor's wardrobe changed dramatically as he abandoned his tweed, his braces, and his old TARDIS interior.


His new coat is a purple frock coat.
His waistcoat is usually either in light purple, black, or in tweed gray.
The boots. Smith's new boots are tan boots that come up to his ankles and lace up, and were light brown in colour.
He also wears what appears to be a fob watch (Ah! Remember ""Human Nature"" and ""The Family of Blood"" two-parter? Thank you David Tennant-era!)
If you want the costume from ""The Snowmen"" and ""The Time of the Doctor,"" go with a long purple trench coat. They might be hard to find elsewhere, but if you search for actual replica costumes, you can get your hands on one!

, They have a lot of things you could use for the 11th Doctor, If you want, get some weird headwear. Go for a fez or a stetson (preferably a fez). Stetsons are cool.

, ""Didn't anyone ever tell you? There's one thing you never put in a trap if you're smart. If you value your continued existence, if you have any plans about seeing tomorrow, there's one thing you never, ever put in a trap...Me."" - Eleventh Doctor (The Time of Angels, 2010)

Experiment with Peter Capaldi's look.,
Get the coat.,
He wears a blue cardigan with his white dress shirt, however from the episode ""Flatline"" onwards, he started wearing a black waistcoat (only with his white dress shirt).,
Get a dress shirt, in either white, navy blue or purple.,
Add black or charcoal black dress pants.,
Wear black boots.,
He sometimes wore a long sleeve black jumper with holes in it, over what seemed to be a white undershirt.,
You're now ready.",How to Dress Like the Doctor from Doctor Who13," He's the new boy on the block.

, Like Matt Smith, he has a frock coat. His is more of a black or navy blue coat.

, This is really a matter of opinion on what you want to use.

, The collar should be big, preferably narrow with no buttons on the collar points, and every button should be done.

, They also may just be suit pants.

, Dress boots may fit the bill (the official ones are black Doc Martens, yet again).

, He would also sometimes wear a plain black hoodie over it in cold weather (see ""Last Christmas"" for reference) with the hood over the coat., We have all twelve Doctors (and the debatable John Hurt/War Doctor). It's time for adventure and mystery. Now, ""Shut up"" - 12th doctor, multiple episodes, and have fun.

, Knowledge is power, and since the Doctor does not carry any weapons, you will need a lot of it.

, The TARDIS does this for him, but you don't have one and learning different languages is really cool and useful. You can also try learning how to address people in different social situations. Don't get worried it you mess up a bit, because it's all part of learning. This also helps with the whole travelling thing - if you are travelling in a country that doesn't speak your first language, it's often good to know the main language.

, Make your own up. However, if the established rules make sense and are there for a reason, don't go breaking them for no good reason. The key is to think; are those rules sensible for safety and well-being or are they just a case of authoritarianism and blind allegiance gone wild? Hone your critical thinking skills!

, Make sure you know what the words mean, and preferably how to pronounce them!

, If you don't, then don't be insulted if someone corrects you! It's always good to get more information and you can impress people with your new knowledge. Thank people for helping you to better understand things.

, Be nice to friends (and enemies!) if they're having a bad day, and make sure you compliment people. Don't be tactless, though!

, It doesn't matter what kind, long distance or to a shop you have never been to before, just travel. Always be well informed about the places you are travelling to, but don't think you know everything about said place, because you probably don't.

, You don't have to look it, but do try. Running is a great way to exercise and burn off steam, and it is very Doctor Who.

, If you need to run, run. Always be ready to run.

, The Doctor is known for helping/saving people and planets. Don't be afraid to show a little tough love as you do it though.

, The Doctor is a great believer in second chances; he even gave the Daleks a second chance. Find the redeeming features in others and seek the good. Realize that some people continue to misbehave precisely because they feel that other people have given up on them. Let them know that's wrong.

, If you see someone being picked on, beaten up, attacked or upset help them. if there is a large group shout, if not then go to the person and get them out. If you can't do anything without getting hurt yourself, then get reinforcements.

, Protect your friends and others around you. Never desert your friends. They need you in hard times, even if you have fights, stick together. Don't leave them; if they forget you, remember them and safeguard them. Do everything you can to ensure they are safe.

, Try combining the two and trying out technobabble (which is talking very fast about technology, mixed in with a little nonsense).


Be sure not to overdo your enthusiasm and glee. Make sure you act appropriately to the situation - the Doctor quickly switches between this and complete seriousness depending on the situation.

, The Doctor is. Dress well too, simple and well-cut always works, but add a little odd touch, like the 5th and 10th Doctors' glasses which he doesn't need.


That said, don't boast. Remain modest to the core.

, The Doctor does it all the time and it makes you and other people laugh. You may not be the class joker, but try making a sarcastic or witty comment from time to time.

, However, when you are justifiably angry, there may come a time when it is appropriate let it loose if innocent people are suffering. Be a pacifist but don't neglect the need for justice to end unfairness. Some things, like starving children and slavery, are worth being angry about.


The Doctor tries not use harmful weapons, the most deadly thing he usually does is to use his sonic screwdriver on them (of course, his reputation helps a little). No killing required, by all means give them an electric shock and knock them out but don't harm them. If you feel you may get in a fight, try to talk your way out of it. With practice, you should be able to thwart someone simply by talking to them.
If you can't talk yourself out of somewhere, put your physical skills to good use and run. If there's nowhere to go, then you may have to fight back but never seriously injure anyone.

, Never give up.


Don't let go of everything––hold on to it and carry on, try not to fall apart.

, Sure it can be lonely at times but there is a difference between loneliness and fruitful solitude. Plus, being able to be alone shows that you don't fear the things to come and that you're willing to reflect deeply.


Don't purposefully ditch your friends to be alone all of the time, otherwise you won't have any. If you are more sociable, spend time with a few close friends as well as with a big group.

, Be ready for anything!


This might include having a first aid kit in your bag, on your bike or in your car; a tissue for a sobbing friend; a rain poncho for a downpour; a secret language to communicate in; a tiny flashlight for when the lights go out; and so forth...

, If you're scared of something, try getting over your fear (if you have a serious phobia, don't shock yourself though) or facing it with someone else.

, Don't worry about backup plans, or plans at all. Think as you go-why stop and plan when you can run and do? It doesn't hurt to have some idea of what you're doing. That way you can plan ahead a little, but be prepared for anything and don't have a specific plan that will fail if one thing goes wrong.

, You just need to realise that. You are who you are and nobody can take that away from you––it is your choice, not your friend's choice, not your parents' choice, it's yours, completely yours.

, Talk to anyone and everyone with no concern for what they might think of you. Be nice to people, though. Going up to a stranger, saying 'I hate your hat', and walking away isn't polite and it's not very Doctor-y either.

, When somebody asks you a question about yourself, give vague answers and change the subject. You could also use this as an opportunity to find out more about the other person - give a quick answer and ask their opinion on the same subject. Make sure you listen, as well.

, A person you can trust, who enjoys travelling and living as much as you do. This could be a best friend, a family member or a pet: basically anyone who you get on with and can talk to.

, If you have lost something, then you know how others may feel. Only share intimate detail with friends and people you trust, everyone else you need to be vague with because nobody knows what people you don't trust can use information to do, they can use it against you at the best and worst of times.

, You never know which detail might save your life and your conversations will always be interesting.

, Try to look on the bright side, but when things get serious, be defensive. Look for the good things in situations, but don't just ignore the bad things because you don't like them: try to change them instead!

"
The first step is to do your homework.,
Once you think that you know what you want, set your budget.,
Make it yourself: There are two paths to this, either you can go thrift shopping, dollar store hunting to put together the elements you want, and restitch your findings accordingly.,
Buy it straight up: Research Ebay, amazon or cosplay dealers sites, find what you like in your budget and buy it.,
Have it commissioned: This is the best option if you can’t sew, but you’ve got the time to wait and the money to burn.,
If you are not buying it, pay close attention to details.,
Work with what you have.,
For accessories you have her silver teardrop earrings that are about an inch long, and either her red boots and gloves, or her converse-style boots and black leather gloves.,
Get the personality.",How to Cosplay As Tifa Lockhart," First you have to decide which Tifa outfit you want, one from the games, or the one from advent children. When you’ve decided this, start researching. Look up pictures, get screen shots of her clothes from various angles that highlight the different elements you want to incorporate into your piece.;
, This will keep you from going overboard when you aren’t really ready to commit $200 into this. You have a variety of options for making the outfit.

, Or, you can find the patterns you need, and sew it yourself, only buying accessories such as earrings, shoes and gloves.

, The pros to this are that it usually saves time and money. However, it tends to look fake.

, Find someone you know that sews. In some cases professional tailoring services may do this as well, but will be more pricey. Find the fabrics you want, threads, etc. and offer to pay for your friends time spent. Those that love to sew usually are just thrilled with the opportunity and the free fabric and may do it as a service. Don’t count on this though.

, You can make the difference just by getting realistic and varied fabrics for each part of the outfit. For example, in FFVII AC you should notice that she has a sort of woolen apron in the front, with 6 buttons, attached by a belt to her back skirt that is made of a stiffer, smoother fabric. It cannot be stressed enough how much it helps if you really look like the character. With that said, we’ll turn to the second part: Details.

, If you have short blond hair and blue eyes, reconsider. You’ll end up with a wig and contacts. Though you can’t do any thing about your facial features, see if you have a triangular face, but if not, find a way to create that effect. For makeup, Tifa has thick eye shadow, and medium long lashes, with a pale brown shadow across the eyelids. Her lips are very pale, and not glossy at all, so don’t try lipstick. If you have brunette hair, try a dye that only darkens it, but for paler hair, go with a brownish-black dye or a long wig with that color. The style of it is a side-sweep bang across the left eye, and longer bangs on the right that are half tucked behind her ear. The rest of it can either hang down, or be put into a red ponytail that is towards the end.

, It should be noted in your research that her Advent Children boots have white heels, and a significant tread. (They are best seen during the fight scene)

, Tifa is a mature young woman who does care a lot about her comrades and beloved ones. Besides her revealing appearance, you will never hear a bad word from her. She is very gentle and shy, and speaks with her doings rather than her speech. Also, she takes problems much to heart, and often feels grief or sadness. She has difficulties showing her feelings to others, and because of her taciturnity she doesn't get well along Cloud, who is very withdrawn, too.

Series four is the best to watch for this as it features Donna, Martha, and Rose, and you don't have to watch through three series. Amy Pond appears in series' 5 and 6, and Clara has just recently debuted in series 7.;
, Talk to people and help them out - even if you don't know them all that well.

, Be prepared to do anything and everything. All four companions are very adventurous, and it changed their characters' lives!

, Rose was very fast-thinking and witty, Martha is funky, sarcastic, and sad sometimes, and Donna is funny with a soft side. Amy is independent, strong-willed, and stubborn. Clara is brave, sweet, and flirty.

, Rose was known for her strong eyebrows and blonde hair, Martha for her spiky hairstyle, Donna for her pale skin and auburn hair, Amy for her green eyes and orange/red hair, and Clara for her layered dark hair, and large, brown eyes.

, Like both Rose and Amy clicked with the Doctor because they were curious, Martha because she was smart and hungry for life, and Donna because they picked up on each other's humour. Clara and the Doctor clicked due to the fact that Clara continually helped him out, and he wished to know more about her.

, The companions have to face lots of scary and tough stuff, and being strong is an essential quality.

, It's the drive to save people that makes the companions very popular.

, Martha was the companion most recognised for her clothing, with her iconic spiky hair, pink top, jeans, and red leather jacket. Donna has a lot of clothes on board the TARDIS, so you could approach it from that direction too.

, Who didn't love the 'new' Martha in The Sontaran Strategem?!

, Sarcasm, drollness, wit, sometimes even be funny about things you don't know about! But remember, don't be too rude.

, Bring your friends to meet them, but you don't have to tell them everything. As Martha said in the The Sontaran Strategem, sometimes if you don't tell your family stuff, they can be taken advantage of or your actions can get you and them into trouble.

, Concentrate on their good points. It was great to see Martha and Donna getting along in The Sontaran Strategem.

, Companions generally have to do whole a lot of running.

, The jacket comes down to about his ribcage. It's sort of like a bomber jacket, except it's a half-jacket.

, For the fur, it is best to find fake fur at a store. It should be glued on to a piece of black leather long enough to fit around the neck of the jacket. Sew this piece onto the jacket and the fur-collar is finished.

,

, Yeah, they sell them online, but avoid the ""real silver"" ones because they can be really expensive.

, These are optional.

, If you need a belt, don't hesitate to get one.

, One belt has a light brown/red tint and silver buttons on the front. The other is a plain black belt with silver buttons. The black belt should be slightly larger.

, To make these, find three regular belts and cut each part in half. These can be sewn on or glued on with hot glue.

,, If you think of Cloud's hair, Squall's is similar, except it's not going in every direction. You can find tons of wigs online, or if you have long brown hair, grow it out to about chin-length and keep it straightened. You can style it by looking at the reference pictures of Squall.

, Red paint should do the trick. Use a small paintbrush, and have someone paint it on for you.

, The actual blade has a distinct shape to it. The handle is a revolver, so finding a fake gun is the best idea. To make the blade, find some wood, and cut it in the shape of the blade. Alternatively, I used one single block of wood as the inner part of the sword, then used cardboard to create the blade's shape around it. Attach the blade to the revolver using hot glue or Gorilla glue, which can get messy. Don't apply too much of the Gorilla glue if you choose to use it.

Make sure you have a ligature.,
Decide on a reed.,
If you wish to wet your reed, wet it only in water.,
Slide the ligature over the mouthpiece until it's almost in its final position, with the screws loosened a bit.

,
Carefully slide the wet reed under the ligature.,
Slide the ligature down to about the bottom of the reed and tighten it just enough to hold the reed snugly, but not enough to hold it too much (which can stifle the vibrations of the reed), or to break the ligature.",How to Put a Reed on a Clarinet1," Ligatures can be made of metal or leather - metal ones are silver colored and usually tighten with two screws. Leather ones are more expensive, are usually black, and normally have only one screw. They usually come with the instrument, but can also be bought separately. Ligatures are universally designed for right-handed players: the screw you turn will point to your right side.



Metal ligatures are cheaper, and can work just fine, but tend to have a tendency to ""bite"" the reed (create indentations on the bottom where the clamps are that make it difficult to change the positioning of the reed after being played once)

Leather ligatures are more expensive, but often can create a better sound, and do not bite the reed. The system with one screw is easier and quicker to adjust, and the pressure on the reed is more evenly distributed. They usually come with more expensive instruments, or can be bought separately.;
, Look at color (a green looking reed will not play well, but a yellow or golden brown one will), condition (check for cracks or splits), and the grain of the cane (it should all be going the same direction and should be relatively smooth). The article here will detail this further. Also, be sure that the reed is the strength you're used to, or, if you play with different ones, that it fits the current playing situation.

, The saliva and acids in your mouth deteriorate the reed. Constantly dry the reed once warmed up because remember, saliva is constantly distributed on the reed as you play. Also, dry by sliding the tip of your finger along the length of the reed toward the point. Reeds are essentially thousands of little straws, so sliding along the reed allows all the straws to point the same way, allowing smoother playing.

,, Line it up so that it is perfectly centered, the edges are in line with the rails on the mouthpiece, and you can just barely see a tiny sliver of mouthpiece over the tip of the reed.

, Many reeds have a vibration line visible on them. Try to get the top of the ligature below this line to allow the top of the reed the full range of vibration.

If you have curly hair, it´s best to straighten it or over-thinking your idea of being like Rinoa. If desired, get her light brown highlights. If you want your hair to look a little spikier (for the bangs), use hairspray or hair gel to spike them a little, but just a little. Note that her hair flips inward at her back.;
, And - yes - Rinoa is seen wearing make-up. Line your eyes with a dark brown eyeliner (as black is too heavy), apply mascara, and definitively stay away from cat eyes!

The first one consists out of a blue sweater with white wings painted on the back, blue gauntlets, a spaghetti-strapped black camisole, a black ribbon on her left biceps, black shorts with zippers under a dark blue denim skirt with three metal buttons, dark-grey combat boots with belts, and a silver necklace with a ring. Her second outfit consists of a white knee-length neck holder dress with a satin strap and a chiffon layer at the edge, white high-heels, her silver ring necklace and a small silver cuff bracelet.

, Rinoa always wears her silver necklace with the wedding ring of her mother on it - you have to wear one, too (this is absolutely recommended)! As she is a very angelic character, wearing jewelry with angel wings on them will let you look A LOT more like her!! As her favorite colour is pink (not blue) and she is often seen standing within pink flower petals, you might want to wear pink flower jewelry, too!

, Rinoa is upbeat, cheerful, strong-minded, stubborn and openhearted. It´s very difficult for her to hide her feelings or keep secrets, and her straight-forward attitude often annoys other people. Nevertheless, she´s very sweet and kind, even by acting unconventional and irritating. Rinoa depends very much on her friends, without them, she feels lost.

, Rinoa often creates cute new words from old ones, such as ""Oharo"" (from ""Hello"" and ""Ohayou""(Japanese greeting)).

, If Rinoa runs, she runs very clumsy. Rinoa often brushes her hair aside, clutches the rings on her necklace, puts her hands on the back, or pulls her knees to the front while sitting at the floor. When talking to Angelo, she crouches onto the floor, and when taking charge of a situation, she puts her hands on her hips. When flirting with Squall, she bends closer to him to look in his eyes. She often jumps up while throwing her arms in the air or puts her hands together when she is happy. Her best-known motion is her index finger pointing in the air, but also shaking in a ""no, no"" motion.

Unscrew the ligature slightly, and carefully slide the reed out from underneath it.

,
Take the reed off and wipe it (if necessary) gently to dry it.,
Put the reed into a reed holder until you use it again.,
Take the rest of the clarinet apart and put it back in its case, leaving the screws on the ligature a bit loose, to make it easier to put a reed on the next time.

",How to Put a Reed on a Clarinet2,", You can let it soak in clean water for a while (which will extend the life of the reed).

, A reed holder gives the reed a safe place to sit while it dries, and lets you carry more than one reed at once.

  This is the key signature for the E flat Major Scale (the Db scale for the clarinet, as it is a transposing instrument).,
Get a feel of how a scale sounds.,
Begin by learning the B flat major scale.,
Next, learn the other ""basic"" scales (the ones that occur most often in music you will play).,
Learn the next few scales, that some directors might call the ""intermediate"" scales.,
Finally, you will learn the last 5 major scales.,
Learn to play scales two octaves.,
Work on playing them 3 octaves, once you've mastered two.,

Try different types of scales.",How to Play Scales on the Clarinet,"

Recognize flats and sharps, and understand key signatures. Flats make the notes sound a half step (semi-tone|) lower and sharps make them sound a half step (semi-tone) higher. Study your fingering chart, and refer to it if you come across a note you are not familiar with. Also be aware of notes that have two names -- for example, F# and Gb are the same, G# and Ab, etc. This will be important to know on that harder scales.
, A good musician can tell if they've played a wrong note immediately, even if they've never played a certain scale before. There's a pattern or half and whole steps that you should be able to recognize without even thinking about it., Since the clarinet is a transposing instrument, it actually starts and ends on C (to play it one octave, start on below-the-staff C and end on third space C). All the notes in this scale are played natural. This is also a good scale to learn if you're just learning to ""cross the break"" -- get from the second space A to B natural and above., These are the Eb scale (starts on F, one flat, the one octave scale is just a matter of lifting fingers), the Ab scale (starts on Bb, two flats), and the F scale (starts on G, one sharp)., These scales are often played for auditions, if the requirement is to play 7 scales, so they're important to know. These are the Db scale (starts on Eb, 3 flats), the C scale (starts on D, 2 sharps), and the G scale (starts on A, 3 sharps). Starting to see a pattern here?, These are the most difficult, and they are as follows -- the Gb scale (starts on Ab, 4 flats), the D scale (starts on E, 4 sharps), the A scale (starts on B, 5 sharps), the E scale (starts on F#, 6 sharps), and the B scale (starts on Db, 5 flats)., This will definitely increase your chances of doing well in auditions, and is also a good way to work on high notes. Most scales can be played two octaves without any of the highest notes (above-the-staff C# and up), with the exceptions of the C and B scales., This is a great way to work on the highest notes on the clarinet, and again, octaves make all the difference in auditions. Some scales are very difficult (almost impossible -- that would be the C and B scales) to play a third octave, so it's best to start with the ones that start the first octave the lowest -- the D, Eb E, and F scales., This is also an important part of auditions, and is very useful for getting your fingering chart into your head. A chromatic scale can start on any note, and it covers the whole range. Typically, clarinets start on G, but any note is fine. The scale pattern would be G, G#, A, A# (Bb), B, B# (C), and so on. It's basically just playing every single note on your fingering chart in order. Work on learning this scale 2 and 3 octaves as well. Another common pattern is from E (the lowest note on a standard clarinet) to E 3 octaves higher., Now that you can play all the major scales, try learning natural minor, harmonic minor, and melodic minor scales, or even more bizarre scales, like gypsy scales. You can also work even more on your major scales by learning scales in 3rds, or purchasing a method book with scale exercises in it."

Assemble your clarinet and make sure your reed and ligature are positioned correctly.,
Place your two top front teeth onto the flat surface opposite of the reed, about 1 centimeter (0.4 in) to 1.5 centimeters (0.6 in) from the tip.,
Place your bottom lip so it goes over your bottom teeth - don't put too much of your lip into your mouth - and put your lip onto your reed.,
Wrap your lips around the mouthpiece in a ""closing the drawstring"" fashion to make sure the air is locked, but don't squeeze the reed too hard, or you'll squeak.

,
Position the mouthpiece so it points down.,
Sit up straight, and don't let your back slouch and touch the chair.,
Close your eyes, think happy thoughts, and blow into the instrument.",How to Make a Correct Clarinet Embouchure,";
, Experiment with this as you get to playing, if this placement doesn't work for you.

, Try to stretch your lower lip out as if you are putting on lipstick, which will flatten your chin and help you to produce a better tone.

,, If you point it forward, it won't create as great of a sound.

, Scoot forward slightly in your seat. This helps air flow and tone quality. This is very important because if you slouch the noise won't sound right

, Start softly, so you can barely hear it, then start increasing the volume by blowing more air in the clarinet. If you've done it right, it should make a nice sound instead of a squeak or a weak noise. If not, try adjusting how much mouthpiece is in your mouth.

Count through the music, by saying the numbers out loud, using the pie game, tapping your foot, or any other method you know.,
Look for areas that you can play.,
Start slow.,
Work on the music one section at a time.,
Work from both the beginning and end of the piece.,
Don't be afraid to ask for help.,
Try to find a recording of the piece you are working on.,
When you finally master the music, play it for an audience or a judge and be proud of your accomplishment.

",How to Learn a Hard Piece on Clarinet," If you come across an unfamiliar rhythm, try to figure it out, or ask someone to explain it to you.;
, Even in a very difficult piece of music, there's bound to be a half note or two. Even playing those will give you somewhere to work from.

, Figure out how fast you can play the hardest section of the music and practice the whole thing at that tempo. Continue increasing tempos until you can play the whole piece at the marked tempo. A metronome may be helpful for this.

, You're likely to find themes and rhythms that repeat, which will help you a lot once you get them down.

, Since most people practice starting at the beginning and slowly learning the rest, the beginning ends up being great, but the piece deteriorates as you play through it. If you learn from both ends and work to the middle, any parts you don't know as well might be more easily overlooked, because of your solid beginning and ending.

, If you take lessons, get your teacher to help you with the piece, or enlist the help of a band director, friend, or other person with more musical experience than you.

, A professional performance may add great insight into how the piece should be performed.

Understand that these notes are pitched squeaks and probably won't be the most relaxing sounds to your ears for a while.,
Finger a top space E. Then lift your top finger.,
Finger a top line F. Now, do the same thing for this note, except for intonation reasons put your pinky on the key used in low G#.,
Follow this pattern until you get to the high F#.,
Finger the D you learned earlier.,
Finger the E you learned earlier.,
Press the register key down without the thumb down.,
Cover the top two holes on the upper joint with the thumb and register key down.,
Cover the top hole on the upper and lower joints, keep the thumb and register key down, and keep the pinky key down.,
Notes above this can be produced using overtones.,
Remember that playing above a high A is largely a matter of overtones and not so much an exercise in fingering.",How to Play Altissimo Notes on Clarinet," As you get used to the fingerings and air intensity, you can shape the sound to create a warmer tone.;
, This will be your first altissimo note. Meet C#!

, This is D.

, Now, only cover the middle hole on the upper joint, the two bottom holes on the lower joint, and keep the pinky key down. This is high G, exactly one octave above the top of the staff.

, Now you will perform an overtone. Try blowing into the clarinet harder and aim for getting a half step higher than G, G#/Ab. This note can also be done by playing G from the previous step and lifting the 3rd finger on the lower joint, so only the 2nd hole on both the upper and lower joint, and the upper left pinky key as normal are being covered.

, Now perform an overtone on this for an A. This note can also be played by pressing the 2nd and 3rd holes on the upper joint, like playing the high E, but instead of using the upper left pinky key, use the lower left pinky key, the same one used for 3rd space/middle register C#. This is more of a standard fingering that could be called an overtone, but the C# key makes it much more of a defined A.

, Press the key used for the G# on the staff. Finger the rest like the high F you played earlier. Now aim to play the overtone and get A#.

, Cover the top two holes on the bottom joint and make sure you haven't forgotten the pinky key for any of the altissimo notes(excluding C#). Now try to make the pitched squeak on this note and if you can get it out, you have accomplished playing a B over an octave from the staff.

, This is high C, on top of the 5th ledger line over the staff! This is an accomplishment!

, It is advisable to use the altissimo fingerings you just learned, because then you don't need to try as hard to get the right note, you're in the range already.

, The best way to prepare yourself for this is to play the mouthpiece. To do this, take the clarinet mouthpiece and using only changes in your throat play different notes. You should (with practice) be able to play an entire octave on the mouthpiece alone.

Understand what a chromatic scale is.,
Understand enharmonics.,
Be familiar with the clarinet's register system.,
Warm up.,
Choose a starting note.,
Play the scale one octave using a fingering chart (you'll play every ""box"" until the you reach the top note) or written copy of the scale.,
Work up to two, and even three octaves.",How to Play a Chromatic Scale on the Clarinet," Unlike the major scales, which follow a pattern of whole and half steps, a chromatic scale is played by starting on one note, playing every single note in between in chronological order, hitting the same note on another octave, and then doing the same thing in reverse until you reach the original note. In case that doesn't make sense, take a look at this picture of a written chromatic scale, starting on C:;
, Enharmonics are notes that sound the same, but are written differently. If you're familiar with the layout of a piano keyboard, you should have an idea of how this works. A sharp raises a note one half-step. A flat lowers it one half-step. The white keys on a piano are the natural notes, and the black ones are flats and sharps. The black key between the D and E is the Eb/D# key, as it's one half-step below the E, and one half-step above the D. Hence, enharmonics. Many notes have two names, and when reading music to play a chromatic scale, you will likely encounter this.

, On most instruments, a low D and a high D are fingered the same way, with an octave key on the back to change octaves. However, because of the clarinet's design, the key on the back of the clarinet is called the register key, and pressing it bring the note up a twelfth, not an octave (eighth). Because of this, most fingerings on the clarinet have two names. For instance, the thumb hole and the first three tone holes covered produces a C, and when the register key is added, the note becomes a high G. Especially if you switched from a saxophone or other instrument with an octave key, this will be important to know.

, To play a smooth, clean chromatic scale, you'll need to have your reed and your hands warmed up and ready to play.

, Remember that whatever note you choose, you'll need to be able to hit the one at least an octave above it. A good note to try would be low G (the one below the staff), especially if you're a relatively new beginner. Usually, when a chromatic scale is requested as part of an audition, it's supposed to start on low G or the E below that. Keep in mind that you may see these notes referred to as Concert F and Concert D, respectively.

, If you started on low G (concert F), you'll play low G, low G#, A, Bb, B, and so on, until you reach the next G up (in this case, the G on the second line of the staff from the bottom), and then you'll start on your way back down to low G -- G, F#, F, E, Eb, and so on. Practice this in whole notes, half notes, quarter notes, etc., and see how quickly you can play it cleanly. You should be able to hear each note clearly defined, even if you're playing in sixteenth notes.

, If you've been playing for a year or two, the second octave shouldn't be a problem at all. If you start on low G, you'll just keep going until you reach the second G above that, which would be the G on top of the staff, and then go back to your starting note. The third octave will take more time to master, but if you make a habit of practicing and really work on your altissimo notes, you'll be able to play that in time, as well.

Periodically use a q-tip and wipe it around the inside and outside of the mouthpiece to remove the gunk that will collect.

,
Place the mouthpiece cap over the mouthpiece, then store the clarinet in its case.,
Finished.

",How to Clean and Maintain a Clarinet," Put the rest of the clarinet in a safe place that is not too hot or too cold. Don't stand it on end, unless you have a clarinet stand (it holds your clarinet upright, and can usually be folded and stored in the bell), since it can fall over.;
, Then, carefully place the cloth back in your case. Don't use any kind of metal polish (unless the clarinet is all metal, ie: silver) or other substance on your instrument, except for key oil and cork grease. Key oil makes the keys move more easily, and cork grease makes assembly go smoother and keeps the corks from drying out.

, You may have to do this several times. Take the pieces apart and dry the tenons (these are the places where the joints of the horn fit together.) Then, let the swab dry before putting it in the case, otherwise your keys will be discolored.

, Grease the corks by rubbing cork grease on them with your fingers. Cork grease comes in many different forms, but the most common looks like lip balm. However, lip balm is not an appropriate substitute for cork grease, and cork grease can be poisonous if ingested, so do not confuse the two. You don't need to do this EACH time you take your clarinet apart, or even very often, as too much cork grease will weaken the corks and make them prone to breaking apart. Just examine your corks regularly and apply cork grease as needed depending upon the dryness or wear in the cork. You may need to grease them more often in the dry winter months. If the instrument is difficult to put together or take apart put cork grease on the corks.

, Then you may, if necessary, take out your dusting stick. Dusting sticks are long, twisted, thin, wire, with a small, broom-like thing at one end, and a little thing that looks like a tooth cleaner at the other end. Gently clean between and under the keys with the mouthpiece-brush end, and brush the dust off with the broom end. Pay close attention to the tone holes that your fingers cover as they often collect gunk and grime from your fingers. You may wish to polish the instrument again after doing this. This would also be a good time to oil the keys, if necessary.

,,, Put the case in a safe place. Also, if necessary, take just the mouthpiece itself, and run it under warm tap water then dry thoroughly.

Wipe the mouthpiece dry.",How to Clean Your Clarinet's Mouthpiece," Loosen the ligament. Remove the mouthpiece and the reed inside of it. Also undo the barrel joint that connects the mouthpiece to the joints that contain the keys. It’s a good idea to do this cleaning every time you play in order to remove moisture that can damage the clarinet.


If you want, you can separate the lower joints in order to individually clean those parts of the instrument, but most of the time this isn’t necessary.;
, When you play your clarinet, you leave saliva on the reed, which leaves behind food particles and creates a moist place for bacterial and fungal growth. After playing, take a soft cloth and use it to dry the reed before storing the reed in its case.Remember to wash your cloth on occasion. A dirty cloth will put germs and saliva back onto the reed.

, Cleaning of the bell and joints can be done with a specialized swab on a string. Run the string through the bell and out the other end, then pull the swab through. Make sure the swab is spread out to reach as much of the instrument as possible. If you separated the clarinet’s joints from one another, you can swab them individually this same way.Specialized swabs can be bought online or at music supply stores.

, During your regular cleaning, you can put the mouthpiece under cold or warm running water to remove saliva and debris beginning to form. This will make later deep cleaning easier.

, Before you reassemble the clarinet or store the pieces, make sure the mouthpiece is dry. Use a swab on a string by running the string through the mouthpiece and pulling the swab through. Leave the mouthpiece out in the open to dry in air for several minutes to half an hour to ensure all moisture is gone.

, Always use a clean swab on your instrument to avoid reintroducing moisture or harmful substances. Throw your swab in a washing machine with the rest of your clothing before you forget to clean it, then hang it so it can dry for the next use., The container needs to be big enough to house the mouthpiece and cover it in liquid. Place the mouthpiece tip down inside the container. The container itself can rest inside a sink.At least once a month but preferably once a week, deep clean the mouthpiece.

, Use a solution of half water and half white vinegar or hydrogen peroxide. Either one will work to deeply clean the mouthpiece. These substances are not strong enough to damage the instrument. The water should be cool or warm, never hot.A typical dish soap is also capable of cleaning the mouthpiece in cool or warm water.

, After the mouthpiece has soaked for several minutes, scrub it with a gentle brush to remove any buildup. Stores sell specialty mouthpiece brushes that won’t scratch your instrument.A baby toothbrush can also be used to remove limescale.

, Put the mouthpiece under a faucet of cool or warm water. The water washes away the soap, vinegar, or hydrogen peroxide and helps remove any remaining limescale. Repeat previous steps for a mouthpiece that is still dirty.

, This isn’t required, but germicide ensures that all the bacteria is removed from the mouthpiece. Sterisol is regularly sold for instrument cleaning, but mouthwash can also be used. Soak the mouthpiece in a small container of the solution., Use a paper towel or soft cloth to remove all moisture before reassembling the clarinet or storing the parts. Leftover moisture can damage the pads in the clarinet or create a breeding ground for bacteria inside your instrument case.


You can leave the mouthpiece to dry on the paper towel or cloth to make sure all the moisture is gone.

Try some breathing exercises.",How to Hold a Clarinet," From bottom to top, there's the bell, lower joint, upper joint, barrel, and mouthpiece. The silver band that holds your reed to your mouthpiece is called the ligature.






;
, You can begin with any portion, but I find it easiest to put together the joints first. Remember that the joints have a silver button and ledge that interlock to help you to play certain notes. Be sure that these two parts are interlocked properly.








, It attaches to the lower joint fairly easily, be sure to push with enough force to get it on properly, but not enough to break it. Most people will twist the bell as it goes on.








, This can be the hardest part to put on the clarinet, and if your clarinet is new, be sure to use plenty of cork grease on the upper joint. This will allow you to easily remove the barrel when you're done playing. Push down the same way you did with the bell, twisting if you think it's necessary. Remember, it's okay to leave a couple of millimetres between the lip of the barrel and the upper joint for tuning purposes.








, The mouthpiece is very delicate and can be expensive to replace, so always grip it around the bottom, not the top. Twist back and forth to get onto the barrel, but make sure the flat top is in line with the keys. If it's not, you'll get lopsided when playing,








, Hopefully you've had your reed in your mouth and have been wetting it. This lets you get a good sound on the clarinet and avoid chipping the reed. If you haven't, give yourself a couple minutes to suck on your reed until it's nice and wet. Unscrew your ligature so that there is room to tighten. Then, put the reed against the mouthpiece so the flat side is against the opening. Cover the reed with the ligature and tighten the screws. If the reed is crooked or too high or low on the mouthpiece, unscrew slightly to adjust.








, Let your fingers firmly press over the holes on their pads, but be sure to give yourself the ability to move from note to note. Your first second and third fingers should be covering the front three holes. The pad of your thumb should cover the back hole.

, Hook your right thumb underneath the silver hook that is designed to help you hold the clarinet easily. Similar to the upper joint, your first second and third fingers should be covering the holes with their pads. In the case of this half of your clarinet, your pinkie finger will be dealing with the other keys below the basic holes.

, Hold your arms at a little less than 90 degrees so that the clarinet comes up to you and not the other way around. Allow the bell to be pointed out slightly, but avoid the Kenny G position.

, Think of your airway as a straw. If it kinks or bends, you won't get good airflow and your sound will suffer. Bring your clarinet up to you, and set your stand so that you have to look up ever so slightly to see your music and conductor. Keep in mind however, that a little bit of a chin tilt is a good thing. Find a happy medium.

, No crossing your feet or legs. This makes your hips twist and can alter the way your breathing works. This is a guarantee for bad sound. Try to avoid this as much as possible to keep away from forming bad habits.

, If you breathe through your nose, fill up as much as you can. Do the same through your mouth if that's your preference, but try to take discrete breaths. You don't want to be in the middle of a performance and look like a guppy in a fish tank. Remember to keep your shoulders down at all times!

, To be sure you're getting good breaths, do some breathing exercises before warm up or whenever you can. Sit with your shoulders still and in proper playing position, but with one hand over your stomach. Think about filling your stomach up like a water balloon, and focus on making your gut expand so your hand moves away from you. This allows you to take in more air than ""pillar breathing"" where your stomach doesn't move. Practice this way of breathing until you can get as much air as you can in one beat, then less. When you're beginning to master this, apply it to your playing.

Know if you're ready to try to conquer the altissimo register.,
Consider private lessons, if you aren't taking them already.,
When you first try to play altissimo notes (which start with the C#6, or the first C# above the staff), just relax.,
Try taking more mouthpiece in your mouth.,
If you are still having trouble, consider investing in a new mouthpiece and/or ligature, different reeds, or even a new clarinet.,
Keep practicing.",How to Improve Your Tone Quality in the Altissimo Register of the Clarinet," Ideally, you should have been playing for a while (at least a year, give or take some depending on how dedicated you are and how quickly you've progressed) and have a decent grasp of the chalumeau (lower notes) and clarion (what you previously considered to be ""high notes"") registers. If you take private lessons, ask your teacher before you attempt to advance into the altissimo notes.
, While not required, a teacher can help you advance more quickly on your instrument and will help you spot problems and fix them, possibly saving you from a lot of frustration and/or spending a lot of unnecessary money on new equipment., Don't change anything major about your embouchure, but use more and faster air. To ""warm up"" your air, try saying the ""E"" syllable when you play. You will probably feel compelled to pinch your face or bite down harder if you have trouble, but don't do this. It creates a very bad habit that will only hinder your progress. Only try a few notes at a time, only advancing when you're comfortable with the previous notes., If doing this improves your tone in the altissimo register, chances are, you haven't had enough mouthpiece in all along, and should continue to do this regardless of how high you're playing. You should hear a good change in the tone quality of every note you play., If you're serious about playing clarinet, the money this will initially cost will be well worth it. Once you find a clarinet, mouthpiece, ligature, and reed combination that works with you, it will last a lifetime.

Try using different brands and/or strengths of reeds. If you're using relatively soft reeds (2, 2.5, or 3 in some brands), that may be part of your problem. Harder reeds, while a bit more difficult to play on, will support your high notes and improve your tone. A better quality (read: more expensive, but it's worth the investment) brand or a different type of reed may also help. For instance, Vandoren makes three popular types of reeds, each with a slightly different cut that makes it play differently. Try out many different kinds of reeds until you find a brand and strength that works for you.
Consider using a different mouthpiece. If you're still using the mouthpiece that came with your instrument, it may be time for an upgrade. Especially if your mouthpiece has no markings or brand names on it at all or says ""Made in China"" (meaning that it is a very cheap stock mouthpiece), there's a good chance that's what holding you back. Like reeds, all mouthpieces have very subtle differences that can make a huge difference in the quality, sound, and ease of your playing. Go to a music store and try several different mouthpieces, and choose the one that feels and sounds the best to you.
Try buying a new ligature. If you're still using the metal ligature that came with your clarinet, you definitely need to try a leather ligature. Rovner ligatures are relatively cheap, very popular, and last for quite a while, or you can go for an even more expensive brand. Some ligatures have interchangeable plates or other features that give you more control over your sound. Try several ligatures and pick one you like that is within your budget.
If all else fails, consider a new clarinet. This is a much more drastic step than your other options, but if you plan to continue in music, it will become necessary at some point. If you're playing on a plastic student model, a newer horn could make a lot of difference. Wooden clarinets have a much warmer, prettier sound, and a more expensive instrument will be designed specifically to sound better, be more consistent, and be easier to play. If your budget doesn't allow for a brand new wooden clarinet, consider buying a used one. There are lots of perfectly good used wooden clarinets available, if you know where to look. As always, try several clarinets before buying one and pick the one that's best for you.

, It takes years to fully master the altissimo register of the clarinet, but hopefully you're well on your way."

Choose a good reed.,
Have the best clarinet that you possibly can.,
Practice the open-throat tones.,
Make sure your embouchure is correct.,
Similarly, make sure you are filling the clarinet with air.,
Practice and play often.,
Keep working at it.,
Don't give up all your practice.",How to Get a Good Sound on the Clarinet," Most beginners start out on a 2 or a 2 1/2, but if you've been playing for a while and are moving into the higher register and/or altissimo notes, try a 3 or 3 1/2.;
, If you're still playing your 20-year-old hand-me-down Bundy, it's time for an upgrade -- go for a good plastic or wooden clarinet. Wood generally has a very nice tone quality, but plastic clarinets can sound good as well, and they're cheaper. If you already have a good clarinet, be sure to keep up with its maintenance. A COA (Cleaning, Oiling, Adjusting) once or twice a year is very important.

, The F, F#, G, G#, A, and Bb in the staff are the open throat tones for the clarinet. This means that when playing these notes, you are plugging very few (or no) holes, and are usually only opening more. The air in the clarinet is going to travel less and with barely any resonance in the clarinet. Sit up straight, and, using the diaphragm, push air out playing the open G. Try to relax the throat so it's nice and open while not losing the embouchure. This takes years of practice and muscle training.

, Many players who are just starting or have never had correct instruction will make the mistake of ""smothering"" the reed with too much bottom lip, closing the throat to limit airflow, or any number of other mistakes. To form a correct embouchure, you should flatten your lower lip against your bottom teeth (as if you are putting on lipstick), which will flatten out your chin. Place the mouthpiece on your lower lip, rest your top teeth on it, and close up the ""gaps"" with your lips, in a drawstring fashion. This prevents you from putting too much pressure on the reed and should make it easier to produce a rich, full sound.

, While it is a small instrument, it does take some work to get the most sound and volume potential out of it. When breathing, fill up your lungs from the bottom up, and blow from your stomach, not your throat. Be sure to sit up straight and have correct posture while playing. If this is done correctly over a long period of time, you'll notice your lung capacity gradually increasing and you'll strengthen your abs. If you are having trouble feeling what this kind of breath support should feel like, try standing up with your feet together and putting your weight on your toes, to the point where you are almost leaning forward. Play something. Once you see how this should feel, you should be able to transfer the same breath support to playing while seated.

, Your tone quality will only get better the more you practice, and it really helps with the highest and lowest notes.

, Good tone quality doesn't happen overnight, and in the end, it all comes down to skill and dedication to the instrument

, It will definitely be worth it!

Choose a brand.,
Decide what strength you'll need.,
Decide on a cut.,
Go to the music store and buy a box of reeds.,
Take all the reeds out of the box, and get ready to evaluate them.,
Play-test the good reeds.",How to Choose a Reed for a Clarinet," There are many to choose from, and all brands make and sell their reeds a little differently. Rico, a US brand, is popular with all clarinetists, and is often recommended for beginners. It also makes reeds under the La Voz and Mitchell Lurie names. Vandoren (which also makes mouthpieces) is a popular French brand. Other French brands, some lesser known than others, include Selmer (which also makes clarinets), Rigotti, Marca, Glotin, and Brancher. Some other (and more uncommon) brand names are Alexander Superial (Japan), Reeds Australia, Peter Ponzol (also makes mouthpieces), RKM, and Zonda. If you're still relatively new to playing, Rico and Vandoren are both highly recommended brands.;
, Most reed manufacturers sell reeds in strengths from 1 to 5, often in half-steps. A 1 would be the softest, and a 5 would be the hardest. Some brands use ""soft"", ""medium"", and ""hard"" instead. For a beginner, a 2, or 2 /12 would be the best starting point. Keep in mind, however, that what one brand calls a 2 1/2 may be another brand's 2 or 3. Also, a box of 2 1/2s will have some variants... some that are closer to a hard 2, or a soft 3. A reed comparison chart such as this one (PDF) can help you see how different brands compare to each other on a strength scale.


A harder reed gives a heavier, thicker, and fuller sound. It's more difficult to correct the pitch with a harder reed, but it also means that changing dynamics won't result in pitch variations as easily. It's also more difficult to play low pitches softly with a hard reed, but altissimo notes are easier to reach.
A softer reed makes playing easier - the reed speaks more easily, and gives a lighter, brighter sound. However, there is a greater chance for pitch variations as you play, though it is easier to correct the pitch with your embouchure. High notes can be difficult to achieve with a soft reed. Also, fast tonguing (16th notes at 90 or more BPM) can be harder on softer reeds.

, Reeds come in either ""regular"" or ""French file"" cuts. Cut won't matter to a beginning student, but file-cut reeds generally have a faster response time, and the few extra bucks to buy them are definitely worth it. You can identify a regular-cut reed as having the cane on the bottom meet the sanded part in a clean U-shape. On a file-cut reed, part of the ""U"" has been shaved down a bit to create a flat edge on the thick cane (see image). Players with darker-sounding mouthpieces may prefer filed reeds, while ones with brighter-sounding ones will stick with regular-cut ones.

, It's okay to buy one or two, but the more reeds you have, the more good ones you have, and buying in bulk will save you a lot of trips to the music store. A box of ten should last you a few weeks, though you can choose to buy more.

,


Check for splits and cracks. Throw away any broken reeds - they're beyond hope already.






Hold them up to the light, one at a time. You should see an inverted ""V"" shape. A good reed has a perfectly centered and symmetrical ""V"". A ""crooked"" V will be hard to play, and there is a risk of squeaks.

However, if the ""V"" is only slightly off-centered, you can remedy the problem by shifting the reed slightly so that the ""V"" is centered on the mouthpiece (not centered on the reed)


An uneven grain (where the little vertical lines in the reed are pointing towards the V instead of running straight through it) will not play well, either.
A reed with knots (little spots or dark areas in the grain) will vibrate unevenly, and is also a dud.
Take a look at the color. A good reed is yellow to golden-brown. A green reed is too young, and will not play well, if it plays at all. Take green reeds and leave them somewhere for a few months - sometimes they improve themselves over time.







, The duds can be thrown away or left to sit for a few months, depending on what was wrong, and you should be left with a handful of good ones. Test them to make sure they play well, and always have at least 3 good reeds on hand. You can purchase a special reed holder for this.

Obtain a soprano saxophone to practice on.,
Check the case for the following: Clean out rag on a weighted cord, cork grease, mouthpiece and ligature, and possibly a polishing cloth.,
Check to be certain the instrument is in good working condition.,
If purchasing, shop around online.,
Practice the new fingering.,
You will need to practice playing the saxophone, especially the upper register notes, to get used to the fingering when your eye falls on each note in the music.,
Your lower lip may be sore for a few days with the new mouthpiece and reed on the saxophone.,
Enjoy the versatility of the saxophone!",How to Change Instruments from Bb Clarinet to Soprano Saxophone," They're generally more expensive than a clarinet, so you may want to rent one at first., If these items are absent, you must purchase them separately., The pads should be clean and soft with no age cracking and each note hole must seal airtight. Those pads are the substitutes for your fingers so be sure they are in good working condition., Some nice instruments can be had at significant discounts from what you'll find in a music shop that sells only new instruments., Fingering on a saxophone is the same for the upper register as it is for the lower register. The only thing you have to do is remember the register key by your thumb. The Saxophone notes run (all fingers down and all valves closed) C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C in both upper and lower register. This is the same as the lower register on your clarinet, so you have, in effect, already learned saxophone notes.

Note: All saxophones have identical fingering, so once you've learned soprano saxophone, you know the fingering and can play any saxophone so long as you have music for it. (Transposed into the correct key signature by the music company or composer.);
, This can take a while, so plan to spend an hour a day doing this for at least two weeks before attempting to sit in band and play the saxophone instead of clarinet. It may help to abandon the clarinet for this period of time to help retrain your brain in the new fingering., Generally speaking though, the only difference here is that you will be blowing your tone into a metal tube instead of a wooden one, which produces a ""metallic"" sound rather than a ""hollow"" or ""wooden"" tone., With practice, you can make it sound like a horn, a clarinet, or an oboe. Or play it for it's own unique reed/brass hybrid sound that we've all come to love."
"
Decide how much you are willing to pay for your mouthpiece.,
Decide what type of music you want to play on your new mouthpiece.,
Consult your private teacher (if you have one).,
If you have a good idea of which mouthpiece you want, you can just order it on Amazon or Woodwind & Brasswind.,
If you don't know what you want, pay a visit to your local music store.,
Try each potential mouthpiece on your clarinet.,
Make sure you stick to reputable brands like Vandoren, Selmer, and Yamaha.",How to Choose a Clarinet Mouthpiece," While some mouthpieces go up to $200, others are only $30.;
, This can usually be split into two groups: classical and jazz.


Usually, classical mouthpieces will have less space between the tip of the reed and the tip of the mouthpiece. This allows for a straight, pure tone. Examples include:

The now-discontinued (and somewhat vintage) Selmer HS** (HS double-star). It can still be found in eBay (if you trust that kind of thing).
Many people also like the Rico Reserve mouthpieces.
Ebonite (hard rubber) is the preferred material for classical mouthpieces.


On the other hand, jazz mouthpieces will have more space between the tip of the reed and the tip of the mouthpiece, allowing the player to ""bend"" the note.

Vandorens (especially B45 and B44) are very good jazz mouthpieces.
Jazz mouthpieces are usually made of ebonite (hard rubber) if projection is not necessary (i.e. large jazz band) or crystal, which is very bright and projecting (but also fragile)
This usually requires a softer (lower-numbered) reed.



, They can often provide invaluable tips about your mouthpiece based on your playing ability and style.


If you have the mouthpieces in question with you, they can be your ""musically knowledgeable person"" mentioned in step 3

, (To be safe, make sure you get a return policy, just in case you end up not liking it)

, They might have mouthpieces that you can try. Make sure to bring:


Your clarinet (in good working order). Not all good mouthpieces will necessarily work on your clarinet.
(Optional) A musically knowledgable person (other than yourself). Your playing sounds different to you than it does to an outside listener. Ask them their opinion on which one sounds better.
A metronome and tuner.

, Rate it from 1-10 on (in order of importance) intonation, tone quality, security from squeaks, and response.


To test intonation, play long tones into the tuner and see if you are in tune (you are in tune if the needle is centered, or close to centered on the tuner).
To test tone quality, play long tones on each mouthpiece and judge by how good it sounds.

A mouthpiece is even better if you can change (consciously, of course) between a bright and mellow sound.


To test security from squeaks, play octaves (low __, high __ low __, etc.) in varying tempos.
To test response, play a piece or scale and see how much you have to try to get a sound out (but make sure it's not too easy, or it will sound when you don't want it to)

, If it doesn't have a logo printed on it, be skeptical, as it usually will be of poor quality (or so badly worn that the logo is rubbed off).

Make sure that you are interested in a student clarinet.,
Buy a reputable brand.,
Save your money and do not spend more than around $1000 for this level.,
If you live near a reputable music store, play some instruments before buying.",How to Buy Your First Clarinet," This is an investment, so you'll want to spend your money wisely. The good news is that quality instruments appreciate in value: you can usually resell the instrument for at least the amount of the original purchase.;
, Remember that as a beginner a plastic clarinet (and resin and resonite) as it is more durable than wood and is much cheaper. Remember when it comes to clarinets, plastic is good, not bad. Do not think that plastic in clarinets is the cheap plastic, it is meant for the clarinet, and are practically indistinguishable to most listeners. For new or used clarinets, try Buffet-Crampon, Yamaha, Selmer Paris, or Leblanc for top notch clarinets. Selmer USA, Vito, and Jupiter make decent quality clarinets also. The best Student clarinets include the Buffet B12, Leblanc LB320, Yamaha YCL-255. As for intermediate clarinets the Buffet E11, Yamaha YCL450N, Leblanc LB210N, and Selmer USA CL211. Do not get tricked into buying any of these brands as they are extremely cheap and will hold you back as a student: Mendini, Cecilio, Merano, Conductor, Legacy, and Lazarro and brands on eBay that are from China with no name; some of those instruments are ok but ask an expert. You can also check out Orsi and Ripamonti, and Lark, which are lesser-known foreign brands that are mainly active in the lower price range. As for older brands, a great one to look into is Bundy - many music stores have fairly cheap secondhand Bundy clarinets. These companies make reputably sound clarinets for a decent price.


Look around at the different music stores that sell instruments in your area. Different stores have different prices and specials, so shop around.






Search the internet. There are no major tuning or tonal problems with the mainstream student clarinets, and you can pick up a used Bundy 577 or Vito Reso-Tone, as well as the Buffet B10 and B12, and Yamaha YcL-255 (or YCL-250 as its discontinued) for a good price on the internet. As long as there is a good exchange policy for those rare cases that there are missing pads or such, internet should be no problem with student models. You might start by searching the instrument brands' websites, but sites like eBay and Craigslist may also be an option.







, If you quit, then you won't have wasted too much money.

, Most large music stores, that sell mostly instruments will welcome having you test them.

Explore possible problems and solutions.,
With some of this in mind, take a trip to the music store.,
Make some adjustments.,
Practice.",How to Avoid and Remedy Squeaking on the Clarinet," Many things can cause squeaking, some of which are easy to fix, and some of which may not be. Ask someone else with more clarinet experience to watch you play, perhaps a music store employee repair tech or band director. They should be able to help you figure out what's wrong. If you want to try to evaluate yourself first, see this list of common problems:



Clarinet: If you're playing on a beginner model or your instrument has suffered a lot of wear and tear, that's likely the problem. You could have damaged pads (or they may even be gone), messed up keywork, cracks (if it's a wooden clarinet), or any number of other things. A COA (Cleaning, Oiling, Adjusting) will probably fix this, unless your clarinet is in such bad shape that it would be better to just get a whole new one. Ask someone at a music store to help you.

Embouchure: If the problem isn't the clarinet itself, it's extremely likely that it's your embouchure, as there are many ways to form an incorrect one. First, you can try a simple test to see if your embouchure is correct: Finger a high G (the one sitting on the line above the staff), and then hit the G# key. If you don't hear a clear altissimo E (the one above the staff), you're doing something wrong. If this happens, ask someone else to watch you play and critique you or play in front of a mirror. Some things to check for...

Amount of mouthpiece: You may not be taking in enough mouthpiece (thus not giving the reed enough room to vibrate), or you may be taking in too much. Adjust your mouth until the squeaking stops.
Air leaking: Make sure your mouth is forming an airtight ""pouch"" around the mouthpiece. It's possible that air may be escaping out the sides of your mouth, which makes playing difficult and can cause squeaks.
Biting/Pressure: You may be clamping down too hard with your top teeth (which isn't good for your teeth, the mouthpiece, or your sound), biting into the reed with your bottom teeth, or just applying too much pressure overall. Try to loosen up a bit, but not too much... experiment a bit. To protect your teeth and the mouthpiece from damage, you may want to buy a mouthpiece cushion -- a little piece of rubber that cushions your teeth and protects them from the vibrations of the instrument. They're available for a reasonable price at most music stores.
Tonguing: Certain (wrong) tonguing techniques can put too much pressure on the reed and cut off the air flow unevenly for too long, which can cause squeaks. All you need to do is practice tonguing, and this should get better in time, with proper instruction.



Hand Position: Especially with young children, hand position can present an issue. The child's fingers may not be large enough to cover the toneholes, or they may not be able to support the weight of the instrument. When this happens, players develop bad habits like using the bottom trill keys for additional hand support, which can cause some strange sounds, or placing their thumb incorrectly on the thumb rest, which will be a very difficult habit to break later. There are a few options to deal with this:

Neck strap: A neck strap can be purchased for a reasonable price that hooks onto the thumb rest of the clarinet, taking some of the instrument's weight off of the arms and transferring it to the neck.
Smaller clarinet: If the fingers are still too thin or too short, a neck strap won't help much. Some teachers start younger children on the Eb clarinet, which is like a smaller, more ""condensed"" Bb clarinet. However, this does have its drawbacks. Eventually, the student will have to get used to the Bb clarinet, which plays slightly differently, and Eb clarinets are usually very expensive. One exception is the Kinder-Klari, which is designed for children. Some brands also sell clarinets with plateau-style keys so that even small fingers can close them.
British Lyons clarinet: This special clarinet is designed for kids ages 5 or 6. It has a plastic mechanism, is pitched in C, and looks very different from a regular clarinet. It weighs a third of a regular clarinet and is also very easy to maintain.



Air Flow: The key to a good sound on the clarinet is to have ""fast"" air, but that doesn't mean ""loud"" air. Bad air, in addition to a bad instrument, reed, or embouchure, can produce some pretty awful noises. This is something that will get better in time. Practice, or you may even wish to take private lessons for additional guidance.

Reeds: Many factors in a reed can cause squeaks. First, check and make sure none of your reeds are cracked or chipped. A damaged reed is guaranteed to always produce squeaks. Next, evaluate your reeds more closely. This article will explain how to do that by examining the ""V"" shape in the middle of the reed for flaws. If your problem is still persisting, you may wish to try a harder reed (if you're playing on really soft ones), or a softer one if you're playing on a harder one. You may also want to try experimenting with brands -- better quality cane and cut may make a huge difference.

Playing Experience: Realistically, if you just started playing last week, you're probably going to squeak for a while. It'll get better eventually with dedicated practice and perhaps a better instrument or higher quality reeds. A one-on-one lesson with your band director or a private teacher may be able to help you, as well.;
, Explain that you've been squeaking a lot, what you think the problem might be, and ask for their input. Whatever you should decide to do, the staff will be happy to help you out.

, Have your clarinet repaired/overhauled (or buy a whole new one), re-learn your embouchure, start buying a different brand of reeds, or anything else it takes. This may end up being a bit expensive, but it will definitely be worth it in the end, especially if you plan to move forward with music.

, It's true that practice makes perfect, and music is no exception. Keep in mind that you will still squeak occasionally, but you should see a major improvement. Congratulations, you're well on your way to becoming a great clarinetist.

Be sure that you really want to switch to tenor sax.,

A used tenor saxophone in its case with all the things needed to play and clean it.]],

Assemble a Tenor Saxophone|Assemble the saxophone]].,
Familiarize yourself with the keys and fingerings, and see how they relate to the clarinet's mechanism.,
Play a few notes -- you'll need a fingering chart for this.,
Adjust your embouchure.,
Once you've gotten good at the tenor sax and made the commitment to stick with it, ask your director for tenor sax music and start practicing.",How to Switch from Clarinet to Tenor Saxophone," If you plan for this to be a total switch, keep in mind that you may go from the first chair clarinet player and one of the best players in your band to the last chair tenor and weak link of the band for a while, and you'll be learning everything but reading music all over again. If you think you're up for it, though, go ahead and proceed.;
, Purchase or borrow a tenor sax in decent condition and all the things necessary to play and maintain it. If you're in a school band, the school will probably have an instrument that you can rent, or you can rent one on a rent-to-own program at your local music store. You will also need a method book or two, preferably the same one you used to learn the clarinet., Put the neck strap on, pick it up, and just walk around with it to get a feel for the weight, size, and different angle of the mouthpiece. Figure out where your fingers are supposed to go. The right hand should be obvious, but there are 5 mother of pearl keys on the upper part of the instrument. Your fingers go on the second, fourth, and fifth ones, in the same way they would on the clarinet. Think of the first one as the A key on the clarinet, and the third one as the little lever that you use to play low Eb and high Bb., If you study a fingering chart for the tenor sax, you'll see a lot of similarities to the upper register clarinet fingerings. For instance, thumb, register (octave, on the sax), and five tone holes produces a high E, just as it would on a clarinet.


The key above the thumb key is the octave key, which makes notes higher, just like the clarinet's register key, except it takes them up a whole octave, hence the name. If you finger an E and hit the octave key on the sax, you get a high E, unlike the clarinet, where all the fingerings have two names.
The three keys at the top of the instrument are operated by your left hand, and are mainly used for notes above the staff (D, D#, E, and F).
There are four keys with rollers between them that are operated by your left pinky finger, about the same place as the 4 ""left pinky"" keys on the clarinet. On saxophone, this is commonly referred to as the ""table,"" or ""spatula keys.""
L - R: Two bottom keys with rollers (see below), offset key, three aligned keys. View from in case.]]There are four keys on the side of the bottom of the sax that are operated by your right hand. Three are in a row, and one is nestled further in. The top key is used in conjunction with the left hand side keys, and plays high E. The middle one is used as a trill fingering for middle C, and the bottom of the three aligned ones is used for one fingering of Bb.
There are two keys at the bottom of the sax with rollers between them that are operated by your right pinky. The top one makes an Eb, and the bottom makes a low C. Think of them as the equivalent of the top two of the four keys at the bottom of the clarinet.

, You'll soon pick up on the many similarities and will be playing simple music within just a few minutes. Different methods start with different notes, but most suggest starting with the higher notes. As a starting point, you might want to try the notes below. Many simple tunes can be played with only E, D, and C, and F and G just add to the fun. You'll notice how most of these fingerings are the same as the ones for the upper register of the clarinet.


Top space E: Octave key and first five mother-of-pearl keys.
Fourth-line D: Octave key and all six mother-of-pearl keys.
Third space C: Only the second mother-of-pearl key (covered by your left middle finger)
Top-line F: Octave key and first four mother-of-pearl keys.
G on top of the staff: Octave key and top three mother-of-pearl keys.

Releasing the octave key on the G, F, E, and D fingerings produces the same note, but an octave lower. Pressing the octave key for the C sounds a C, but an octave higher.



, As you experimented with the fingering chart, you may have noticed that the octave key doesn't seem to be ""working."" When you finger a D, the sound is the same with or without the octave key. This is common with clarinet players switching to tenor. It'll take some practice to be able to play low notes well, but it's also considerably due to your embouchure. A clarinet requires a tight embouchure, but a tenor saxophone requires a looser one. Adjusting the position of your tongue in your mouth is crucial to gaining full range on the saxophone. The tongue placement varies based on the range, for example: when playing low notes, your tongue will be low in your mouth. The tongue rests in the middle part of the mouth when playing in the middle and high ranges. When teachers say ""Drop your jaw for low notes,"" this is really what is going on; the placement of the tongue and the jaw coming off of the reed permits it to vibrate at a lower frequency. You may also need to adjust the amount of lip you have rolled over your teeth. Saxophone experts generally say that about 2/3 of your bottom lip should be rolled in. Experiment and practice until your low notes sound as good as your high ones.

, Over time, you'll be just as good at the saxophone as you are at the clarinet.

Play your instrument regularly to maintain the action.",How to Assemble a Clarinet," Open the clarinet case and make certain all of the components of the clarinet are in good working condition, clean and ready for use. A basic clarinet will consist of four major pieces that connect by cork-lined joints, as well as a mouthpiece, which is made up of several smaller components.










The bell refers to the very bottom, cone or bell-shaped part of the clarinet.

The lower joint stalk is the biggest piece of the clarinet. It should have metal keys on the right side of the instrument when oriented correctly, with a bridge key pointing up toward the upper joint. The best way to distinguish between the lower and upper joints is that the upper stalk will have two cork connections, called tendons, while the lower will have one lower cork joint and a metal ring around the upper joint, which marks the center-point of the instrument.

The upper joint stalk will have keys on the left-hand side of the instrument and should be slightly shorter than the bottom joint. Oriented correctly, there should be a bridge key hanging over the connection point at the bottom, and some space between where the keys end and the top of the upper joint, where it connects to the mouthpiece. In other words, you'll know you have the pieces lined up correctly because there should be no keys at the very top or very bottom of either piece.

The barrel is a short section of the instrument that basically connects the top joint to the mouthpiece. There are no keys on the barrel, and the barrel will often be stamped with the brand name of the instrument.

The mouthpiece consists of the black mouthpiece housing, as well as a metal ligature, which is used to hold the reed in place on the mouthpiece. Many clarinets also come with a metallic mouthpiece cover, used to protect the mouthpiece in the case.;
, First, you'll want to attach the bell to the lower joint. Holding the lower section, gently but firmly push and twist the bell back and forth while you hold the lower joint securely in your other hand.









Generally, clarinet players will assemble the clarinet by starting with the bell, then attaching the lower joint, the upper joint, the barrel, and the mouthpiece, in that order, although there's no wrong way to put it together. The clarinet won't sound better or worse if you start by assembling the barrel and the upper joint, then start on the bottom and jump around.However you assemble the clarinet, you'll probably want to assemble the mouthpiece last, because the reed needs some time to moisten before you play it. For this reason, it makes the most sense to start with the bottom.

, This will make your clarinet easier to put together and take apart. Most of the time, cork grease comes in a tube that looks like lip balm. If you don't have any cork grease with your clarinet, petroleum jelly can be used as a substitute, though using actual cork grease is recommended.








, Hold each piece parallel to the ground, with the large bridge keys facing toward you, and line them up. Make sure the bridge keys, two little metal pieces under the long keys on the side of the upper joint, are perfectly aligned, then use a gentle pushing and twisting motion to attach the two sections, aligning the bridge keys, and lowering the upper tab over the lower to fit them together securely.









Grip the lower joint with your right hand on top of the piece, just below the cluster of keys in the center of the piece, and over the two large keys toward the bottom. These keys are relatively flat and can be pushed down safely while you grip the instrument without risking bending anything.

Grip the upper joint with your left hand underneath the piece by wrapping your fingers under the instrument and around the large ring key, which should raise the bridge key when you depress it. This will be necessary to get the two pieces fit together properly. Carefully line up the bridge keys and fit the instrument together.

To make sure you've aligned the instrument properly, look at the metal bar that runs the length of each section of the instrument, supporting the keys. Both segments of that rod should be perfectly lined-up. This means the bridge keys will be lined up as well.

, Now comes the easiest part! Attach the barrel onto the top of the horn. The bottom end, which attaches to the upper joint, should be slightly larger than the top end, which attaches to the mouthpiece. Push this small piece down onto the upper joint, twisting gently, and make sure it goes all the way down and fits snugly.









The barrel is pulled out or pushed in to tune the clarinet, by making the instrument slightly longer or slightly shorter, depending. When you're first starting out, though, push the barrel all the way down until you've got some sense of your horn and the way it needs to be tuned.
It's common to prepare the mouthpiece and attach it to the barrel, then screw on that assembly to the top joint of the clarinet before attaching the barrel, as well. One way is not more wrong or more right. It usually just depends on the size of the hands of the clarinet player: some players find working with the tiny mouthpiece too small and prefer having the barrel to hold onto while attaching the reed.

, The thicker half of the reed is called the stock, and to moisten the reed you need to submerge that part of the reed into 1⁄2 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) of water. It's usually best to start the assembly process by soaking your mouthpiece, so it can work while you do the rest of the job.









The capillary action of the reed will pull water from the base to the tip. As the water reaches the middle of the reed, where the slice begins, take the reed out and quickly wet the end into which you blow.
Experiment with how saturated you let the reed get, and see what produces the best resonance for you. Two minutes before band practice starts is not the best time for this experiment.
Many reed players will moisten their reeds by sucking on them. For lots of players, it's a hassle to prepare a tiny glass of water to soak their reeds in the band room. While this is a common way of moistening your reed, you do risk mangling the reeds on your teeth. Some players likewise aren't thrilled about the idea of sucking on a bitter slice of cane. Soaking in water is a more uniform way of moistening the reed.

, Line the tip of the reed vertically with the tip of the mouthpiece. You should ideally try to see a fingernail-width of mouthpiece above the reed, for optimum placement. Hold the reed in place with your finger, moving it around a little with the other until you've lined it up perfectly.









Different reeds have different ""sweet spots."" Perfect alignment with the table (hole) in the mouthpiece is not always best. Some players like to hold it in place with their thumb and try to blow through it, to check the action before attaching the ligature.
Never tap the thin top edge of the reed, and never try not to touch the front, because the sensitive pores may get dirty and lose playability. In general, handle the reed as little as possible.

, Place the metal ligature over the top of the mouthpiece, being careful not to chip your reed. There should be two lines or sets of lines engraved on your mouthpiece, line it up evenly between these. Tighten the ligature over the middle of the base, which is the unsliced half of the reed.









If you have a metal ligature, the screws go on the same side of the clarinet as the reed. If you have a leather one, the screw goes on the back with leather against the base of the reed. Tighten the screws, but leave them somewhat loose for the best vibration and tone. You want it tight enough to keep the reed secure, but not tight enough to dent or warp it.
Some clarinets, rather than metal ligatures will have bands of fabric or leather used to hold the reed in place. These will sometimes attach on the back side of the instrument, opposite the reed.

, Oriented properly, the reed should be facing the opposite direction as the keys of the clarinet. Gently but firmly, twist the mouthpiece onto the barrel of the clarinet, completing the instrument.









Again, some players have different philosophies about when to attach the mouthpiece to the barrel. If you want to attach the mouthpiece to the barrel, and then screw the barrel onto the instrument as the last step, that would be perfectly fine.
Likewise, some players like to attach the mouthpiece bridge and barrel to the instrument before putting on the reed. It's your choice.

, When removing the individual pieces of the clarinet from the case, it's important to handle each piece with your fingertips, touching the tendons of the instrument to remove each section, not grabbing it around the barrel and mangling the keys. Hold it like you would a vinyl record, touching the edges.








, Keep your clarinet well-maintained and lustrous by using a soft cloth and wiping down the instrument gently after handling it. Gently work your clean cloth over the metal keys as well as in between the keys around the barrel.









Even if your hands are clean, the natural oils from your skin can break down and stain the instrument over time. It's very important to always wipe down the instrument, after each use, if you want to extend the life of it as much as possible.
Use a clean dry cloth to wipe down your instrument. Never use any type of metal polish or liquid on the instrument, which can damage the finish and ruin the horn.

, Most clarinets will come with pull-through swabs that you can use to clean out the inside of the instrument as well, or you can make your own easily. A swab is basically a string with a small weight (you could use a paperclip) on one end, which is dropped through the barrel, and a small piece of clean micro-fiber cloth tied to the other end.









After removing the bell and mouthpiece of the horn, drop the weighted end of the swab down through the horn. Grab the end and gently pull it through. Run it back through 3-4 times, until the inside is dry.
Cleaning a clarinet is more a drying process than a cleaning process. Moisture breeds bacteria, bad smells, and can break down the pads on the instrument over time. Clarinets don't like the moisture that will remain in the instrument after a long playing session, making it important that you swab the inside of the clarinet thoroughly after playing it.
Every now and then, leave the clarinet's case open overnight to let the instrument dry out more thoroughly. It's probably best to do this at home, in a safe place, not in the band room at school.

, Some players like to use the swab, while others prefer using Q-Tips or cotton swabs to wipe down the mouthpiece more gently. After removing the reed, thoroughly dry down the mouthpiece, then leave it to air dry for five or ten minutes before putting it in the case. This, in particular, is a piece you don't want to smell gross when you get it out to play next time.








, The most dangerous threat to the life of the clarinet? Human error! It's important to be very careful with your instrument when it's assembled to make sure you don't accidentally damage the horn.










When carrying the horn, hold the bottom of the bell in one hand, and cradle the barrel in your other hand. Never carry it one-handed like a baseball bat, or shoulder it like a rifle. If your tendons are loose, the instrument could potentially slip apart and cause serious damage.

When setting the horn down, never set it on your chair, the floor, or anywhere else unless you're setting it on an upright clarinet stand. Never set the clarinet upright on it's bell, which can tip over easily and risk damaging the instrument.

, A horn needs to be played to make sure it works properly. If you leave it in the case for too long, especially if it isn't dry, the keys can start to gum up, mold can grow, and a nasty smell can develop. Even if you're not planning on playing for several hours, open up the case and the let the instrument breathe every now and then. Assemble it, make sure everything is in good working order, and clean it to maintain the life of the horn.

Make sure you have a good mouthpiece before you buy a new clarinet.,
Get an idea of what you want.,
If you're a very seasoned clarinet player, take smaller things into consideration.,
With that in mind, visit your local music store when you have some time.,
Get a second opinion.,
Once you're pretty sure you've made your decision, ask about some of the following:


How much would it cost to rent this instrument?,
Make your final purchase, and enjoy your new clarinet for years to come.

",How to Buy a New Clarinet," The mouthpiece and reed setup is the most important factor of sound production and its best to have a professional level mouthpiece (Vandoren or Selmer) before you even think of upgrading your instrument.
, There are many things to consider, some of the most important of which are listed below.


Material -- Most clarinets are either wooden or plastic. It depends on your intended use for the instrument and what kind of tone you need as to which one you buy.

Plastic -- A decent plastic clarinet can have a good sound, doesn't crack, weighs less, and needs less maintenance than a wooden clarinet. Since they don't crack when the weather changes, they're more ideal for marching bands and outdoor groups. They are also great for beginning school band and orchestra.
Wood -- More expensive than plastic. Has a generally better, richer sound, and a slightly more expensive instrument may also have a better mechanism, which will last longer. Wooden clarinets are better for indoor groups, because they're easily damaged when exposed to the elements. Most wooden clarinets are made for intermediate to professional players.


Brand -- While even no two ""identical"" instruments sound the same, if you'd had good luck with a particular brand, or you can get a wooden version of your current plastic clarinet model, you might want to stick with that brand. Otherwise, there are plenty of decent brands to choose from. Some well-known ones are Buffet, Selmer and Yamaha.
Price -- The price is usually a good indicator of how well the clarinet is made, how it'll sound, and how long it'll last.

300 - 400 dollars -- You can get a decent, new plastic clarinet in this range, or a fairly nice used one.
400 - 600 dollars -- Nice plastic clarinet, decent used wooden one.
700 - 800 dollars -- Very nice plastic clarinet, or a decent new wooden one.
1000 - 2000 dollars -- This will get you a very good quality intermediate clarinet, which will play much better and last longer than the cheaper ones.
2000+ dollars -- Be sure that you really plan to stick to the clarinet before spending this much. Professionals tend to spend this much, or even more on a clarinet, but you may not need to go this high.


Key plating -- Once you get past the material of the clarinet, pretty much the only other thing influencing the appearance of the clarinet is the plating on the keys. You have the option of nickel, silver, or even gold, though the plating doesn't affect the sound of the instrument.

Nickel plating -- Most instruments costing 800 - 1000 dollars have nickel plated keys. Nickel has a slightly 'harder' shine than silver, it is cheaper, needs less polishing, and is more resilient than silver. However, it tends to be more slippery, which is a problem if you have sweaty fingers, and some people are allergic to nickel.
Silver plating -- Is more expensive than nickel, usually found on more expensive instruments. Has a whiter shine than nickel, and will not cause allergic reactions for those allergic to nickel. However, it does require more polishing.
Gold plating -- If you have very acidic perspiration, silver will tarnish quickly and you'd be better off with nickel, or, as an alternative, you can go with gold plating. It actually isn't as expensive as it sounds, though new clarinets with a fully gold-plated mechanism are rare.



, This would include things such as the clarinet's bore, wall thickness, tone holes, vent holes, etc. You know what you're looking for, most likely. Often clarinetists who play in orchestras will have two clarinets, and you may be able to purchase a set of two; a B flat, and an A clarinet.

, Bring with you a couple of reliable reeds, some music that you can play through easily, and your own mouthpiece. Since it may be difficult to hear differences and know what you want when you start play-testing, ask to try as many clarinets as you can. You can try playing two, deciding which of the two you like best, comparing that one with another one, and so forth. Keep in mind that you'll eventually get tired and stop noticing things as well, so you may want to take a break and visit the store several times.

, This will help with hearing the difference between each clarinet, once you've narrowed your potential instruments down to three or four. You can bring a clarinet-playing friend, or someone from the store may be able to help you. However, do keep in mind that when you hear a clarinetist play two different clarinets, you won't usually hear much difference, but two different clarinetists on the same instrument may sound very different. In other words, the sound depends more on the player than the instrument itself.

,
Do you offer a rent-to-own program?
Can I take this clarinet home on approval?
If I decide I don't like this clarinet, can I return it?
What kind of warranty do I get, how long does it last, and what does it cover?
Do you do little fixes for free, and is this part of the warranty, or a standard thing?
How often do you recommend coming in for a COA (Cleaning, Oiling, Adjusting), does my warranty cover this, and do you send me a notice when it's about time for one.
Any other questions you may have. No question is stupid when you're shelling out this much money for something like a musical instrument.

Lay down newspaper or a garbage bag.,
Take the first sheet of craft foam and wrap it around your arm (or area of interest, in this tutorial the focus is on making gauntlets).,
Cut out that piece.,
Choose one of two approaches to dealing with the base armor:


Take your armor and run your iron over it several times to make it warm and soft.,
Cover the armor.,
Use another paintbrush (or wash off the one you used for the glue) and paint the base color on the entire piece.,
Add finishing touches.,
Bam!",How to Make Foam Cosplay Armor," This will ensure that the painting doesn't ruin your carpet/table/place of working.;
, Using a sharpie or pen, mark the height/length you want your piece of armor. You should end up with four marks (for height and width on both sides and top and bottom).

, If you want to create layers on your armor (to create dimension), cut out strips lower than the the base layer and hot glue them on.

, Then mold the foam form around your arm (or place of interest) so that it takes that shape. You may have to iron it several times and mold it several times until it actually stays. Just be patient and take your time.
The other route would be to do the decoration/detailing of your armor now. Take your armor piece and, using a sharpie or pen, draw on the detailing you want to have on your armor. Then, proceed to taking your puffy paint and tracing it over the detailing you drew. The puffy paint usually takes about 4-5 hours to dry. When dry, you'll want to use the iron on your armor and mold it then.

, When the armor detailing is dry, use the school glue and a thicker paintbrush and just cover the entire piece in glue. Then let it dry. This is what will give the armor a metal look and not look so much like foam.

, You may want to double-coat but this is up to you. Wait for it to dry. Then, take another paintbrush and dip it in plain black paint. Brush off most of the paint onto a paper plate or paper towel until there is barely any paint left on the brush. Then go ahead and gently brush it over the entire piece, making it darker in certain places of dimension, such as where the layers meet or around the puffy paint detailing to make it look more raised off the foam.


When you're all done, if you want, take a really small and thin paintbrush and dip it in your original color base paint (like metallic gold) and go over only the puffy paint to make it look raised, as if the light is hitting it.

, When all of the painting is dry and you're satisfied with the look, take two pieces of ribbon (any color, such as a shiny gold color to match the armor) and hot glue each piece to the inside of the gauntlet. Then tie it around your arm.

, You're done! Or, if you want, you could hot glue the piece together and just slide it on your arm but I prefer tying/untying it.

Survey your current wardrobe for costume components. Anything you already have lessens the amount of work you have to do. Items such as gloves, shoes and hats can easily be modified.
Try to match the footwear as close as possible. AVOID wearing sneakers with a great costume!

Ask other cosplayers how they made certain components. It's a great conversation starter and is generally taken as a compliment.
See what you can find in a thrift store for a base or item you can modify.

For example, in doing a Jesse from Team Rocket cosplay, you can look for a white turtleneck and a fitting black top and a white skirt. Those can easily be transformed into her outfit.

Try out the finished claws.",How to Make Wolverine Claws," Measure the length of the hand when opened, from wrist to fingertip. Measure the side width of the largest finger, as well.


Since hand size can vary by age, gender, and genetics, you should take measurements based on the hand of the intended wearer to ensure the best possible fit.
Write down the length of the hand when opened flat. The length of each claw blade should be one and a half times longer.

For example, if the hand is 7 inches (18 cm) long, the claw blade should be 10.5 inches (27 cm) long.


Write down the side width of the largest finger. The width of each claw blade at its base will need to match this width with an additional 1 inch (2.5 cm).

For example, if the side width of the largest finger is 1 inch (2.5 cm), the base of the claw needs to be 2 inches (5 cm).

;
, The claw template should look have a triangular shape, but each long side of the triangle should be slightly curved. The base should remain straight.









Use your calculated measurements for the length of the claw and the width of the base.
Both curves should open in the same direction and should share the same general arc. The convex edge will be the top of the claw, and the concave edge will be the bottom.

, Cut a curved indentation out of the top edge of the base. The length of this indentation should match the side width of the largest finger.









The depth of this indentation should match half the side width of the largest finger.
Note that you should have 1 inch (2.5 cm) of undisturbed base at the bottom of the claw. You can round off the edges, if desired, but it should otherwise remain intact.

, Use scissors to carefully cut around the perimeter of the entire template.








, Slide the template in between two fingers and examine the way it looks. Make any necessary adjustments to improve the fit.









The curve at the base of the claw should sit comfortably between your fingers.
The length of the claw should seem balanced with the length of your hand.

, Place the claw template at the bottom edge of the sturdy, white collage board. Use a ballpoint pen to trace around the entire perimeter of the claw, copying the shape onto the board.









Trace five more copies of the template onto the bottom half of the board. Make sure that you only use half of the board, however, since you'll need the other half later.
Collage board is ideal since its sturdy enough to last and has one smooth side. If you don't have collage board, you could try using another type of sturdy cardboard or dense craft foam. Card stock can also work in a pinch; the resulting claws will be quite flimsy, but they'll also be child-safe., Using a utility knife, cut around the outline of all size cardboard claws.









Place the board over a cutting mat while you work. If you don't use a cutting mat, the knife can scrape the work surface beneath the board.

, Apply craft glue to one side of the first claw. Position it over the bottom edge of the remaining cardboard, then press firmly to stick it into place.









Repeat with the remaining five claws. Space them relatively close together so that all six fit onto the remaining piece of board.
If you use collage board or another coated board, stick the two rough sides together, leaving the smooth sides pointing out.

, Wait for the glue to dry on all six claws. The two layers should be firmly stuck together before you continue to the next step.

, Use the utility knife to cut around the perimeter of each claw once more, sticking closely to the original edge of the top layer.








When finished, you should have six double-sided claws.
Even if the claws feel dry, it's a good idea to place them under a heavy book or similar object for another 30 to 60 minutes. Doing so should allow the material to finish drying completely flat.

, Cut two lengths of 5/8 inch (1.5 cm) wooden dowel. Each piece should be approximately 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) shorter than the width of the intended wearer's palm.









Use a saw to cut the wooden dowels down to size. If the edges seem rough or splintered, sand them down before continuing.
If you don't have access to a saw, you could use the utility knife to cut four pieces of wooden chopstick or wooden skewer.The length of each piece should still be 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) less than the length of the palm.

, Using the utility knife, cut one hole through the center of each notched base. This hole should be round and about 5/8 inch (1.5 cm) in diameter.









Position this hole in the exact center of each notched base.
If you're using four chopsticks instead of two dowels, cut two holes through the base of the claw, each matching the diameter of the chopsticks.
After cutting out this hole in the first claw, line it up with the remaining claws and trace the position and dimensions of the hole using ballpoint pen. Cutting along this marked pattern will make it easier to keep the hole even for all six claws.

, Slide one wooden dowel through the holes in three cardboard claws. Arrange the claws so that they can rest in between the wearer's fingers.









If using chopsticks, slide one chopstick through one matching set of holes in three claws. Slide another chopstick through the other set of holes in the same three claws.
The amount of dowel space in between each claw should match the bottom width of each finger.
Ideally, the wearer should try on the claw set, and the adjustments can be made from there. Grab the dowel with one hand. Position the claws so that one lands between the index and middle fingers, another lands between the middle and ring fingers, and another lands between the ring and pinky fingers.

, Repeat the previous step with the second dowel and the remaining three claws.








, Once everything is accurately positioned, apply hot glue around the wooden bar where it connects to each claw.


Apply generous amounts of glue to make the claw set sturdy.
Let the glue completely cool and dry before continuing.

, If you used white board, spray paint both sets with matte gray paint. Cover all sides of both sets.


This step won't be necessary if you used gray collage board.
Let the first coat of paint dry. If it doesn't seem opaque enough, add another one or two coats, letting the paint dry in between each coat.

, Once the gray paint dries, apply several coats of metallic silver spray paint over all sides of both claw sets.


As before, you should let the paint dry in between coats. Examine the appearance of the claws after each coat and stop once the claws look the way you want them to look.

, After the claws feel dry to the touch, set them aside in a dry location for another 12 to 24 hours.


The exact amount of time doesn't matter much as long as the paint is 100 percent dry before you handle the claws further. Consult the label instructions on the paint to determine the appropriate amount of time.

, Your Wolverine claws should now be complete. Grab a set in each hand and get ready to show them off.

Have the right face.,
Wear the right clothes.,
Have the right props and accessories.",How to Dress Like a Pirate1," If you want to pull off the pirate look, you'll need to be convincing from the neck up. The right clothes won't take you very far if you don't have the face and head of a pirate. Here's what you do:


Have a nice tan, or apply makeup that is a few shades darker than your skin to give yourself a tanned look. You spend all of your time on the deck of a ship, so it's only natural that you would have a sun-kissed complexion.
Have rosy cheeks. Both male and female pirates are busy sword fighting, sparring, and running around the deck, so they should have a flushed look to their cheeks. Gently apply some blush for the look you want.
Have smoky eyes. All pirates should have eyes that are lined in dark eyeliner to create a smoky effect. Both genders should also apply dark eyeshadow to emphasize their look.
Pirate hair should be wavy and should look natural, like it dried in the sun.;
, Having appropriate attire will help you achieve the pirate look you are going for. Not only do you need the face of a true pirate, but you should wear the shirt and pants of true sea dog to capture the essence of a pirate. Here's what you do:


Whatever you wear, remember that you've spent many years aboard a ship and don't have time to buy new clothes, and that you do your laundry in salty water aboard a ship. Therefore, your clothes should have a faded, lived-in look. The more patches and rips in your outfit, the better.
Both men and women can wear loose white poofy shirts that they can tuck into their pants. They can have untied drawstrings hanging from their collar. Men should reveal their chest hair, and lady pirates can show a little bit of cleavage.
You can layer a red or black jacket over the white top. Pirates can get cold at night on the windy seas.
Men should wear tight leather pants, or ripped black jeans. Women can also wear tight leather pants, or a poofy red skirt and black laced leggings with an interesting pattern. The leggings can have rips in them too.
For shoes, wear either pointy black boots, ragged brown sandals, or even bare feet, if it's appropriate.

, The right props and accessories can help accentuate your outfit and show that you really put a lot of thought into your pirate look. You don't have to be weighed down by too many items, but a few key additions will help complete your ensemble. Here are some things to consider:


A pirate hat (also known as a tricorn hat) is a must. This three-cornered hat will add mystique to your look.
A leather belt. Bonus points if you have a place to store your sword.
A plastic sword. A plastic gold or silver sword that is not dangerous should be tucked into your belt. Be careful with this prop and make sure everyone around you knows it's not real before you whip it out.
A parrot to keep on your shoulder. This will really impress the public. A fake parrot is best.
A bag of gold doubloons to sling over your shoulder. It should make noise as you clink the coins together, and they can occasionally spill out. This will show that you've had a successful time pillaging and plundering out on the sea.
An empty bottle of rum. Pirates love their rum, so you should bring out a bottle of rum filled with a non-alcoholic beverage such as root beer that looks like rum so you can take swigs from it periodically. If you're at a party or another place where it's appropriate to drink, and you're of legal age, drink from a real bottle of rum.
A few key temporary tattoos. A tattoo of a skull and crossbones or of an anchor placed on your bicep, neck, or forearm will help complete your look.
The right jewelry. A true pirate should wear a thick gold necklace and sliver and gold loop earrings. If you're a man and don't have your ears pierced, clip-ons will do.

"
"
Have the swagger of a true pirate.,
Act like a pirate.",How to Dress Like a Pirate2," To pull off your look, you have to be completely confident. If you act like your look is perfectly natural instead of being self-conscious, then people will take you seriously and will be convinced you're a real pirate. Here's what to do:


Don't act like you're wearing a costume. When people compliment you on your outfit, look confused and brush them off.
Walk around with confidence. Strut your stuff, walk with confident strides, and pose with your hands on your hips. Don't cower in a corner with your hands folded, because that's not what a real pirate will do.
Wherever you are, march around looking in all directions, as if you're preparing for a sword fight that you'll win any minute.

, To pull of your pirate look, you'll have to have the attitude of a true pirate as well. You can't slip up and talk like a regular person, and should remember to be capturing the attitude of a pirate at all times. Here's how:


Be slightly aggressive at all times. Scowl, growl, and be surly.
Slur your words. Pirates are tipsy, so don't forget to slur everything you say, and never talk too quickly.
Refer to yourself as ""me."" As in, ""Me needs another swig of this here rum.""
Say ""yer"" or ""ye"" instead of ""your."" As in, ""Ye need to get yeself together, ye mangy rat.""
The occasional ""Ahoy!"" or ""Blimey!"" will go a long way.

Paint the stele.",How to Make a Shadowhunter Stele," To make a stele out of a pencil, you'll need: a pencil, a hot glue gun, hot glue sticks, a sharp tool like an X-Acto knife or a dotting tool, paint and a paint brush and a makeup sponge.


Make sure to get silver paint for the base coat of your stele. If you want other decorations, choose the colors that work for the design you had in mind.
You should be able to get most of your supplies at a local craft store.;
, First, you'll need to remove the eraser as you'll eventually be adding a tip to the eraser end of the pencil using glue and paint. You should be able to remove the eraser simply by using your fingers. However, if it's on particularly tight you can use a pair of pliers. Slide the pliers between the metal casing of the eraser and gently wiggle them until the casing falls off., To make a stele shadowhunter, you need to create a casing of glue around your pencil. This will be painted over in silver later to create the look of a stele. To do this, load a stick into your hot glue gun.


You'll want to do this over either paper towels or newspaper, as hot glue tends to get everywhere.
Starting at the eraser end of the pencil, apply hot glue in rings around the pencil. After thirty seconds to a minute, the glue that you've already applied will be cool enough to touch.
Test it by touching it with your finger. If it's not too hot, rub the pencil between your hands to spread the glue down the pencil.Keep rubbing the pencil between your hands. This will allow the glue to spread down the pencil, covering it an even casing. Apply extra glue as needed. Keep going until your pencil is covered in an even casing for glue.
As you apply glue, there will be thin strains of glue that hang from the glue gun to the pencil. If you want, you can tear these off the glue gun and wrap them around the pencil with a finger. This will add some interesting texture to your stele.

, How smooth you make the base layer of the stele is up to you. If you want it to have a lot of bumpy uneven texture, you can leave it as is. Or you can roll it along your fingers and between your palms to smooth out the hot glue. Smooth out the glue while it's still slightly warm and wet. Dry glue may be hard to smooth out., On the eraser end of the pencil, add a few more dabs of hot glue. Then, smooth it out the base to form a cylindrical top to the eraser end. The idea here is to make the base end thicker than the rest. You want to give the stele a wand-like appearance. It can help to look up images of shadowhunter steles and try to manipulate the glue to mimic their basic shape., Many shadowhunter steles have a snake-like design winding up their side. This is one of the easiest designs to create on a pencil stele. Simply place the tip of the glue gun on the eraser end and slowly draw a line spiraling around the pencil until you reach the tip.Keep in mind shadowhunter steles come in different shapes. If you feel more proficient at the glue gun, you can try to draw pictures of symbols using the glue gun. However, if you've never used a glue gun before it might be best to stick to the basic serpent design for your first try.

, Use your X-Acto knife, a sharpened pencil, or some other small sharp object, work on the base of your stele. The easiest design is to carve out a small circle at the eraser tip, creating a kind of dot in the center of the tip. If you feel comfortable, consider adding your own unique design., You can use either acrylic paint or nail polish to paint the stele. Start with a silver paint. Use your brush, or a makeup sponge. Dip it in some silver paint and cover the whole stele in silver. If you want, you can stop here. However, you can add other colors or designs depending on the type of stele you're trying to emulate. For example, you can color the serpent-like design green and add markings like a snake. It's up to you and what you want your stele to look like.Leave the graphite tip unpainted if you want to use it as a pencil.

Care nothing about what other people think of you.",How to Emulate the Addams Family," Mostly, this is the first thing the Addams family is associated with. Whether it takes the form of sadistic jokes and comments, a grim attitude toward nearly anything, or a simple enthusiastic view over the whole idea of death, agony and pain.;
, The Addams, as in all, are passionate about various things. A sexual and romantic passion in your relationship, a true joy from playing with your relatives, an intellectual interest in art, literature etc., or a fascination over a very specific subject . Find your own passions, and let them show.

, The Addams, no matter how weird it may look to an outsider, are extremely loyal and care deeply about each other, and will do absolutely everything to support and defend each other.

, The absurd thing is, despite their habit to attempt to kill each other, torture each other, and generally put each other's safety on a very frail ground, the Addams consider their behavior a normal display of affection. Of course, don't attempt to stab your sister as a display of affection. Do show some flexibility, and treat the ones you love in a way they would consider as a legitimate way of showing it.

, The Addams' motto is ""Sic Gorgiamus Allos Subjectatos Nunc""- translated as ""We Gladly Feast on Those who Would Subdue Us"". An Addams would be a kind person at the core, but will not let anyone step on his/her pride, nor hurt his/her beloved ones.

, The Addams might seem to be twisted to the normal viewer. However, when you pay more attention, you would easily realize they are the ones making sense, while the ""Normal"" people fail it. At the very end, they are the ones judging people according to their personality and not their image. They are the ones treating each other with respect and love, and developing self esteem and confidence in their children. And they are also the ones to realize there's something horrible about telling little children a story including an old woman being pushed into the oven and burnt alive.

, The Addams, more than anything else, do their best to enjoy themselves, even under the most impossible situations. After all, even under a death threat, there's always a time to share a sweet, romantic moment. And there's always time to play with your food.

, The Addams have reached to the sensible conclusion, that the people around them are mostly the ones who tend to be outright insane.

Act the part.",How to Make Anime Cosplay," The character does not have to look like you, or even be the same gender as you. After all, that's what wigs and makeup are for. Instead, pick a character that you find interesting and that you'd feel comfortable cosplaying as.If you are a seasoned cosplayer, consider doing a complex character as a challenge.


Can't decide? See what your friends are cosplaying, and pick a character from that series. You could start a cosplay group!
Still can't decide? Pick a character similar to you—or completely different from you. You could also ask your friends for suggestions.;
, Chances are, your character will have a few different outfits to choose from. Pick one that appeals the most to you, then find as many reference pictures as you can.If the anime also has a manga or video game, consider looking those up as well. Action figures and statues of characters also make great references.

, You can add a unique spin on your character, such as steampunk, post-apocalyptic, or Renaissance.You can also do a crossover cosplay, such as a Sailormoon/Sailorscout version of a Disney princess. Lastly, you can also do a gender-bent cosplay.


Gender bending is not the same as crossplay. It is when you cosplay as the female version of a male character—or a male version of a female character.

, The more complex a costume is, the more time you will need to do it justice. Don't wait until the last minute. This is where you should also take your skill level into consideration. If this is your first cosplay, or if you can't sew, consider doing something simple.If you are new to sewing, you can still try a complex cosplay, but give yourself extra time so that you can learn and practice the necessary skills.
There is no shame in buying or commissioning a complex piece for your cosplay.

, Will you be spending most of your time indoors or outdoors? Indoor conventions are usually air-conditioned, which means you have more freedom as to what cosplay you can wear. If the convention or gathering will be taking places outside, choose a cosplay that is appropriate for the weather., This includes the obvious things, such as skirts, shirts, and pants, as well as the less obvious things, such as shoes, belts, and other accessories. It should also include things like wigs, makeup, and undergarments., There is no shame in buying some ready-made pieces, especially if they are simple, such as a belt, dress shirt, or slacks. If something is close, but not perfect, you can modify it by dyeing it, painting a pattern on it, or switching out the buttons.Some items are very difficult to make. If you don't have the skill or time to make them, it would be a good idea to buy them instead., Unless you know how to draft your own patterns, you will need to buy some. Sometimes, a simple pattern will give you exactly what you need. In other cases, you may need to buy multiple patterns in order to make all of the cosplay pieces. You may also have to modify the existing pattern to suit the character, such as adjusting the sleeve or skirt length.

, Anime characters often have unrealistic figures and proportions. What looks great on an anime character may look terrible on you. Luckily, this is easily fixed through clever alterations, such as lengthening a hemline, adjusting the waistline, or using a slightly different collar. Most of these changes won't be outwardly noticeable. Your cosplay will still be recognizable. Best of it, it will look great on you!If you plan on wearing any shapewear with your cosplay, put it on before taking your measurements.

, Just because something looks pretty doesn't necessarily mean that it suits the garment type. In these cases, fabric choices for real-life clothing will also apply to cosplay. For example, a military-style trench coat would be made from felted wool. A school uniform skirt might be made from wool suiting. A fancy gown may be made from silk or satin. Most patterns will have fabric recommendations on the back., Follow the instructions on the pattern. Remember to clip the corners and cut notches into curved edges. When you are done, press every seam and hem. These are small details that often go unnoticed, but they can really take your cosplay to the next level and give it a professional touch.Not all patterns will match your cosplay exactly. You may have to modify or combine some of them.
A dress form will help drastically. If you can't afford one, make a body cast from a T-shirt, duct tape, and stuffing.

, Outfits in animated films often lack detail to make things easier and quicker to produce. Adding some details will make the cosplay look more realistic and memorable.If you have a lot of time on hand, and are willing to put in the effort, consider the following:


If your cosplay has delicate gold or silver detailing, consider embroidering it instead of painting it on.
If you are cosplaying a princess, consider adding some tiny rhinestones or jewels—not enough to be obvious, but enough to add some sparkle.
Look closely at the buckles and clasps. If the cosplay calls for it, consider using fancier ones.
Consider jacquard material for historical outfits. They add some texture and pattern without using a multitude of colors.

, These include things like pushup bras, sports bras, shapewear, and dance belts. The right undergarment can make your cosplay lay smoother and look better on you. Make sure that they fit properly, however, or they will make your cosplay look even worse!Listed below are common types of supportive undergarments and their purposes:


If you will be wearing a ball gown, you will most likely need a crinoline, Hoop Skirt, or petticoat. A corset may also help.If you will be crossplaying as a male, try a sports bra or binding your chest.Wear thongs or seamless underwear with skintight cosplays.A dance belt is a must for men.
Try full body shapewear or highwaisted briefs for added smoothness., Shoes are often overlooked, but are an important component of any cosplay. If you can't find the right shoes, you can always modify them by making shoe covers or painting them.Comfortable shoes that fit are also very important, especially if you plan on walking a lot.


If you can't see your character's shoes because they are covered by a long dress, try some dance heels or character shoes. Paint or cover them with fabric to match the dress, and consider adding a pretty embellishment.

, It is highly recommended, even if you are male or cosplaying a male character.Start with a clean face, then apply some primer, foundation, concealer (if needed), and powder.Next, add some eyeliner, mascara, lipstick, and eyeshadow.Step up your game with the following:


Add further definition by applying false lashes and filling in your eyebrows.
If you are cosplaying a male character, wear a neutral or earth-toned lipstick color. Try some contouring.
If you are cosplaying a female character, wear red or pink lipstick, or even lipgloss. Add a healthy glow with blush.

, Purchase a high-quality wig from a trusted wig shop; avoid the cheap Halloween wigs.Cut and style the wig on a Styrofoam wig head. Pin up your hair, put on a wig cap, and then put on the wig. Secure everything with bobby pins.Try to use bobby pins and wig caps that match your wig color. If you can't find the right colored bobby pins, paint them with nail polish.
If your character has floor-length hair, consider sacrificing a few inches and avoiding a tangled mess.If your hair is the right color but the wrong length, consider cutting it or adding extensions to make it the correct length.

, Most anime characters will have little accessories that really make the costume. This includes the obvious things, such as belts, gloves, and hats. It may also include the less obvious things, such as glasses, pocket watches, jewelry, and hair clips.


You can find replica pieces online. Some of them are official replicas, while others are handmade.
You can also find similar, but not exact pieces, in various online and brick-and-mortar shops.
You can also make your own pieces out of foam, clay, Worbla, etc.

, This is not absolutely necessary, but you can really take your cosplay to the next level. A prop can also make your poses for pictures more dynamic and interesting. Watch your character's episodes again, and take note of any props they frequently use. It can be as simple as a rose or tea cup to as fancy as a fantasy sword.


You can make props out of all sorts of materials. Wood, Worbla, and foam are the most popular choices.
Try to make the prop as light as you can. You will be carrying it around all day. Even the lightest things start to feel heavy after a few hours.Check the convention's prop rules. Some conventions don't allow over-sized props or guns., Does your character have a different eye color from you? If so, try colored contacts. Circle lenses are great for giving you that large, anime look.Does your character have scars? You can get pretty realistic scars with liquid latex, scar wax, or even latex scars. And what is a vampire or demon without fangs?, This is not completely necessary, but it can help make your cosplay look more believable. Watch the episodes where your character appears, and take note of how they move and carry themselves. Try to replicate that when posing for pictures.If you come across another cosplayer from the series, try interacting with them in character. Don't force them to play along if they don't want to, however.

Develop a ""6-pack"".",How to Dress Like a Spartan," The Spartans weren't actually bare chested (as in in 300). They wore bronze muscular armor or linothorax. Making the linothorax is probably the easiest if you're going to make your own. Hiring is probably the best option if you don't know how to make the armor.


Wear leather underpants. If you don't have any, paint one pair of undies brown (no boxers, only briefs).;
, To make one:


Heat a piece of bronze and hammer a helmet with an exposed face. Forge a face guard (or buy one).
Attach the face guard to your helmet.

, You can also make one out of tin foil and paint it bronze.

, When you wear it, use a fancy metallic brooch to pin the cape with.

, It doesn't matter what kind as long as they're leather.

, You can either forge bronze or use cardboard and plate it with tinfoil, then paint. Remember that Spartan shields were round and had an upside down ""V"" on the bottom. If you're not sure, search online for some images to guide you.

, If you are going around with a sword, also have a belt and sheath/small loop. The spartan sword is small, like 25 inches (63.5 cm). For more details, see How to make a wooden sword.

, Greaves protect the tibia against attack. Again, you could make your own bronze greaves if you know how to forge metal. Alternatively, make them out of foil and color.

, Swords were more of a secondary weapon, just in case the spear broke or got lost. The spear is the easiest to make: Buy a wooden stick around 75 inches (190.5 cm) long. Sharpen one end.


A professional way to make a spear points can be found at: http://300dc.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1884.
If you don't have enough time, this is another way to make a more ""nooby"" spear: chuck-does-art.blogspot.com.es/2011/10/diy-spartan-hoplite-costume-how-to-make.html.

, Unless you naturally have grey or black eyes, you'll need color contacts in one of these colors. (If you can't get color contacts, you'll be okay without them. Color contacts are a nice detail, but not vital to cosplay.), Yandere-chan is typically depicted wearing her default school uniform, a white, short-sleeved seifuku outfit, along with black stockings and shoes. She has several other uniform styles available to her in the game, along with her school swimsuit and gym uniform. Thus you have a number of options when it comes to what you'll be wearing.

Checking Ebay or a cosplay site for a ""Japanese school uniform,"" ""seifuku,"" or ""sailor fuku"" will likely result in an outfit similar to Yandere-chan's uniform.
A white t-shirt and blue Japanese gym shorts, along with white socks and sneakers, will get you an outfit just like Yandere-chan's gym uniform.
You might have to custom-make some of Yandere-chan's other uniforms, which are more detailed and elaborate.

, Yandere-chan just isn't the same without her trademark knife or a katana. Real weapons are not allowed at most conventions, so you'll have to get a replica.

Other weapons available to Ayano include:

Scissors
Circular saw
Baseball bat
Shovel
Axe
Ritual knife



, To really top off your cosplay, you could splatter some fake blood on your clothes, skin, and/or weapon. Stores often carry fake blood around Halloween, and it can be found year-round online.

, Your cosplay will be even better if you can have a Senpai and some rivals. (The most notable rivals, as yet, are Osana Najimi, the orange-haired girl, and Kokona Haruka, the purple-haired girl with drill-shaped twin tails, but any character is game.) With the help of your cosplay companions, you could have a lot of fun setting up crime scenes and scenarios for photo shoots."

Plan ahead of time to fall short in your portrayals.",How to Dissuade Yourself from Becoming a Cosplayer," Make sure each one is by a different cosplayer and, if you picked a character from a popular series, you just hit upon the first major problem of cosplaying. When you’ve chosen a character to cosplay, always assume that someone has already attempted it. Therefore the previous incarnations are possibly way better or worse than what you could assemble yourself. Take a good look at those photos you’ve selected and you will see that this statement is true.;
, There will always be good cosplayers and bad cosplayers. If you’re a cosplay photo collector, then you're probably quite experienced at identifying which one is which. Don’t kid yourself, the public can see the difference too! The public also could care less if you do it just for fun. They want to see great cosplayers. Nobody wants to see a bad cosplayer!

, Since most anime characters have beyond normal proportions, be mindful of your size. Anything could offend fans of the character. If your body is less than perfect and you decide to risk wearing costumes which exposes enough skin to overpower the costume, you better be tough as nails to deal with the kind of insults some people will dish out.

, It takes a lot of money and skill to make great cosplay. If you can’t sew, you’ll have to pay someone to make your costume and props. It is difficult to find an inexpensive, responsible tailor who isn't planning to simply take your money and run. Buying online may seem like a good decision, however some sellers will put up pictures of great costumes from another website and send you a version that looks as though it were constructed by a four year old.


If you can sew, you’ll have to pay a lot of money no matter where you shop, for the best fabrics, trim and accessories - Most importantly wigs! Wigs can be what makes or breaks your costume. If you don’t have a wig you’ll end up with that Halloween costume look. It's so much worse when the cosplayer decides to spray-paint their hair the color of the character's hair. Then, there are always those cosplayers who wear cheap wigs. Trust me, the public can tell when you're wearing a cheap wig. Great cosplayers get their wigs styled whether it's long hair or short.

, Making the costume is just one part of being a cosplayer. Modeling is also a major part of cosplaying. You can’t wear a costume and not know how to model it! People have and it looks really awkward. Modeling is very difficult because its something that needs experience in order to truly learn. You can study other peoples photos like crazy, but until you're actually there you’ll never know how to do it. Confidence is key--if you don't take pride in your work, people will never notice you!

, Practicing helps big time and personal photo shoots are a must to give you that hands-on experience. Now you're going to have to think fast and try to remember all those cool poses that you found other cosplayers doing. Sitting around looking cute only works for so long. It's actually quite sad when you realize those so called cool poses actually make you feel stupid once you attempt them. If not, then you're trying to go that extra mile straining your body to learn martial arts poses. Either way holding a pose for more than ten seconds hurts no matter what you do.

, You’ll find the flaws in your costume quickly during any photo shoot. Whatever character you’ve made yourself into, you now have a limited range of poses you can do based on the mobility of the outfit and the characters personality. Think along the lines of Mecha suits and Emo guys. While its fun to go out of character once in a while, a great cosplayer can stay in character for every single picture taken.

, Afterward any activity, take a good look all over your costume and count the dirt stains you’ll have to wash out later. Forget what location you choose, you're going to get your costume dirty no matter how careful you think you are. Hopefully, you made your costume machine washable. Unfortunately, most costumes aren’t. So now you’ll have to work on hiding those new stains the next time you go out cosplaying.

, Never get a store bought costume. When attempting cosplay, it may seem like a good idea to just buy the costume. However these costume are always of bad quality and a horrible fit. Store bought costumes don't last with regular wear and are never machine washable. And they look cheap and lazy in at the convention.

, Accuracy is hard. When cosplaying as a character who wears regular clothes like Nathan Drake or Niko Bellic, it is incredibly hard to find clothes 100% accurate. You could spend hours shopping for just one item and only find something 50% accurate. A lot of the time, it's easier to just say close enough, but many cosplayers want to be 100% accurate.

, Braid your hair into two, skinny braids if you have long hair. However, note that the braids should hang down, not stick out. You don't want to look like Pippi Longstocking.


While black may look more like the original Wednesday, it takes a while to come out, and you may look silly with black hair and blonde roots be careful about dying your hair.

, In the musical, Wednesday also cuts her hair short. Don't worry about it. If you're really into details, you can purchase a wig.

, Wednesday's face appears flawless, and you'll want to maintain the complexion of a young girl. If you have a perfect face, keep cleaning it on a daily basis to prevent breakouts. However, if your face is scarred and blemished with acne, consider using clay masks or different remedies to fix it. You could also use a little concealer on pimples, but remember that makeup often worsens the condition of your face.

, To avoid sunburn and hurting your skin, apply sunscreen as instructed by the product. Remember that the paler your skin is, the easier it will burn.

, Wednesday has them painted in that shade in both movies. Ask a parent or a friend for help if you're not sure how to paint your nails. However, if you dislike painting your nails, you may skip this step.

, Examples would be a death or a natural disaster. Wednesday rarely smiles, and when she does, it appears terrifying and frightening.

, Bombard others (especially cheerleaders, Girl Scouts, etc.) with witty, disturbing comments. For example: when someone asks you where someone is, reply ""Which part?""

, Tell random facts about these things at parties or at school. However, avoid appearing as a nerd, for your goal is to sprinkle Wednesday's personality onto yours.

, Its hard to be imposing when you're stuffing your face with potato chips. Wednesday appears to be a slender girl.

, The first step in creating the appearance of the slender man is to imitate his white body. He is known for having completely smooth, shadowless features. There are a few ways to accomplish this going beyond simply painting your body white.


Use a white morph/spandex suit. These are full-body suits that are made out of a thin elastic material. You might recall seeing sports fans wearing these in their teams’ colors, but you can buy one in plain white for a slender man costume.
Use white nylons or pantyhose stretched over your head and face. The material is thick enough to give the appearance of smoothness (your features won’t be incredibly defined), yet thin enough that you can easily breathe through it.
You can use a mask that is completely white in addition to white gloves. Although eye holes are not present in the real slender man, you can glue a sheer white fabric over the inside of the eye holes to allow you some visibility while creating a better illusion., The slender man is always shown wearing a black suit. Over the top of your white body costume, put on a white button-up shirt and black suit. Pair this with a thin black tie, and you’re set.

, Sometimes slender man is shown with black tentacles protruding from his back. Although you can create a great cosplay without the tentacles (as they appear only occasionally), you can make yours perfect by adding them. You will have to make these from scratch, so give yourself a little time to put them together.

Use black pool noodles (the big styrofoam/plastic water toys) and wire to create your tentacles. Cut wire to the desired length, and shape them into the preferred tentacle form. Then, cut the pool noodles into strips a few inches thick, and hot glue them to the wire. You can taper the ends with scissors after gluing them to the wire.






Wrap wire in black duct tape and twist to shape. To add added thickness, wrap the wire in fabric batting before adding the duct tape.






Make your tentacles out of puff-clay. This is a cheap type of children’s play clay that is incredibly lightweight and air-dries after a few days. Form the clay into the shape you want the tentacles to be in, and give it time to dry. Then, spray paint it black to match the appearance of slender man.






Attach these to the back of your suit or sew them to the inside, assuming your suit jacket’s only purpose is for the cosplay and will not be worn again under other circumstances.







, Use nondescript black shoes and socks to finish the bottom half of your suit. Make sure your tentacles are securely attached and your suit is in order. Once you’ve gotten all these bases covered, you’re set!"

Have a few key staples such as a band tee or jeans, and wear jeans as much as possible, even in summer. H&M is a very good store to shop at for Marina-esque clothes because it is her favorite store.;
, They are relatively cheap and Marina loves them. If you can, try to get them in the White Slim Animals style, but pretty much any pair will do.

, Spend a lot of time and effort on your hair, and if you can, grow it out and bleach it so that it is blonde like hers. Never wear it up unless you absolutely need to (eg. it's hot out and you have thick hair, you need to pull it back for sports) and if your school allows it, get turquoise or blue streaks in it. Also, in the later books Marina has side bangs.

, Marina swears by Sephora and Ulta, but also has some other brands in her makeup bag. Absolutely be sure to have white or silver eyeshadow and Dr. Pepper flavored chapstick in your makeup bag at all times. Do not wear mascara or eyeliner. Marina hates it and thinks it makes people look airbrushed.

, OPI and Essie are good brands, but if you don't feel like spending $7.95 on nail polish, you can use Wet n Wild or another drugstore brand. Always use top coat, it makes your nails last longer and it's a very Marina thing to do.

, Good choices are Marc Jacobs Daisy, Pink Sugar, or Jessica McClintock. absolutely do not wear Angel (Marina thinks it's cliché) or Dolce and Gabbana Light Blue (Marina hates it because it reminds her of her ex boyfriend).

, Marina and her friends IM each other constantly. Make sure it represents who you are very well.

, An ideal phone is an enV or enV2 by LG or an Alias by Samsung, but almost any phone will do.

, In one of Marina's weaker points, she lets her boyfriend see her sensitive side. But as soon as she bounces back, she stops being sensitive and becomes outgoing again.

,, They are Marina's favorite.

, An example is Marina's 3rd boyfriend (in the series) Jonathan.

Prepare your physical look.,
Practice walking, sitting, turning, and generally moving in your costume if you plan on, for instance, acting out a scene.

,
Make up is key for this character!,
Makeup lovers might not object to using their favorite cosmetic brands, but other people might not have makeup products, so you can use either theatrical quality make up or the cosmetics you can buy at the drugstore.,
For sideburns, you can buy them or make them out of a bushy beard.,
Get the hair.,
Make sure you have good accessories.,
You'll need to remember that just because you look like the barber, that doesn't mean you are him!,
Don't forget the singing.",How to Cosplay As Sweeney Todd," You'll need to figure out how you're going to dress yourself, whether you are going to make each garment or shop around for some look-a-likes. If you're a diehard fan and you have time, you can either make your garments or buy them off eBay from professional costume makers. You'll need, at minimum:


a white shirt with moderately loose sleeves (A man's dress shirt works very well!)
pinstripe pants (Blue ones are much harder to find, but black works fine.)
a brown vest (This might be a little harder to find and it might be best to make it. Try to give it a rough, worn out look!)
black boots
grey and black scarf;
,, Gather the suggested colors and carefully study closeups of Johnny Depp's character make up.


Start with applying red/copper around your eyes. Cover the top lid with a layer of brown, then a layer of black/charcoal.
Use some of the black/charcoal to give your eyebrows an angry but pleading expression.
Take some of the brown and black/charcoal and build up value on your cheeks to give a hollowed look.
Try to find a cream or powder to give yourself pale skin

, Sideburns can be added last.

, Sweeney has some long ones, keep in mind.

, Hair is a bit more challenging. For people with long hair, you'll need to use a lot of bobby pins and ""snap"" clips to put your hair up in crazy curls. Using a curling iron is a good idea! White hair paint can be bought at party stores to help you get that skunk look. For people with medium length hair, it should be curled,teased and tousled to look insane. A streak of white can't be forgotten! Don't forget to invest in a very strong hairspray.

, Accessories are fantastic for this character. Some good ones to look for are a nice leather razor holster, grey knit or leather fingerless gloves, a large belt with hip rag, and a razor.

, Practice your Sweeney attitude by sulking around and staring off into space. Keep a sad, but vengeful look on your face and don't speak much. If you must speak, talk in a very monotonous and low tone. Practice your angry yell and general empty feelings.

, If you intend on singing, you can do two things. One, mouth the words, or two, use your own voice. Make sure you carry around something that can play music!

, The outfit is made up of lots of things you could find in just about any clothing store, so don't worry too much about finding the parts.

, They are composed of two parts. The first part is a regular pair of black pants. The second are actually beige cutoff pant legs that appear to be fastened to the black pants by several silver buttons. Think of a variation on those cowboy pants you see sometimes. Once you have the beige cutoff pants attached, you're ready to move on.

, Roxas wears things in twos. The first part of his jacket/shirt combo is a black zipper-up sweatshirt. The zipper piece is a complex shape that resembles four arrows or even a shuriken. Look for a sweatshirt with a gray ribbed cuff at the bottom by the waist. The second part is a white short sleeved sweatshirt with a zipper, and various black patterns on it. The sleeves have a black cuff. Near the chest are blocky patterns that match front-to-back. A little bit of the collar sticks out, kind of like if you were to pop the collar and have the two parts stick out.

, If you can find a black athletic wristband and sew in the white squares with white lining.

, He has two cloth ""rings"" on his left two fingers, the index and middle finger. These can easily be made out of some cloth.

, Possibly a size 15 or more. They resemble grey oversized running shoes with several red straps on the top. Look for ones with a big sole.

, Roxas has unusual hair. While not quite as spiky as Cloud's or Sora's, Roxas' hair is pretty wild. Most of it is spiked, but the spikes curve upward, some point straight up. Use lots of styling glue/gel for this. Don't worry if your hair isn't the same color. Dye it if you like. Again, refer to the pictures.

, Roxas seems to prefer Oathkeeper and Oblivion, but it's up to you if you'd like to include one with your cosplay outfit.

Get a large, pink wig.,
Get the dress.,
Consider a t-shirt.,
Add the gem.,
Go barefoot.,
Get a shield.",How to Cosplay as Rose Quartz from Steven Universe," Rose Quartz has luminous ringlets nearly half the size of her entire body. A pink wavy or curly wig with a significant amount of volume can replicate this pretty well.;
, Rose Quartz is portrayed in a white, layered dress with a slight train. If you can't find a cosplay outfit, a sleeveless gown would be best. Many stores have greatly discounted formal dresses after Homecoming (September) and Prom season (June) are over. You could also check second-hand or consignment stores or search the Internet.

, Rose appears wearing one of Greg's promotional t-shirts at one point. It covers her gem, which could spare you the following step. The shirt itself is available online. It can also be easily replicated with a plain black crewneck t-shirt and fabric paint. Look it up online for reference.

, Rose's gem is located where a human's belly-button would be. The gem is bright pink, round, and fairly large - roughly two inches across. Luckily, you can find replicas of the Crystal Gems' gems online fairly easily. If that fails, a large rhinestone might work. Her dress has a star-shaped cutout centered on her gem, so you'll have to make some alterations if you got a gown.


Basically, you will have to locate your belly-button while wearing the dress and mark it, then trace around it with a star stencil, then cut out the star shape.

, Rose Quartz's feet are normally covered by her dress, but they're shown for a second in ""Story for Steven,"" and she does not wear shoes. Transparent or ""invisible"" shoes for cosplay are available online. Alternatively, you could wear a pair of shoes that you feel would suit Rose. (For instance, a pair of sandals or white flats.)


Your feet will probably be hidden by your dress, so you may be able to get away with a pair of athletic shoes - one of the more comfortable options when spending the day walking around a convention hall.

, Rose herself is rarely depicted with her shield, but it might be a nice touch to your cosplay, if you're willing to buy or create a replica. She also uses a sword, so you could replicate that as well, but she is most closely associated with her shield.

Research Link’s wardrobe.,
Start with the torso.,
Fashion the bottom.,
Style your head.,
Cover your limbs.",How to Cosplay as Link from Zelda1," There are different types of a Link costume that you can take. Consider how much time and money you’re willing to spend. Play Zelda and understand the different generations of the video game.


Throughout the generations, the central costume of Link has remained the same.
The basics are his green tunic and cap, blonde mid length hair, white or tan pants, and brown gloves/boots.
He also carries an array of weapons and a shield.You can decide which of the weapons you’re willing to carry, or omit the weapons entirely if you plan to wear the costume to a location, such as a school, that prohibits toy weapons.;
, To get the basic look of Link, you’ll need a green shirt that is long. You could also use a green tank top that extends past your rear. Don’t worry if it fits you too loose, you’ll be wearing a belt over it anyway. Use a lighter green or white long sleeved undershirt.


Check out some thrift stores before spending too much.
Put on the long sleeve shirt and then the green tunic. Finish the torso with a wide brown belt over your waist., For the pants you can use a variety of options based on what generation Link you want to go for. The key to the pants is that they are tight or slim fitting. Go for either white or tan pants.


Tights are also a great alternative and fits the time period Link exists in., The head is critical for achieving a believable Link. Fashion the hair by either using a wig or by dying your hair blonde. Find a green hat that slouches off the back of your head.


If you feel serious you could buy elf extenders for your ears. These are optional, but will add a nice touch to the look.
If you have a wig, you should spend some time with a pair of scissors and try styling the hair like Link's.You can also create your own hat by cutting and sewing a green cloth.

, Any serious Link has to have gloves and boots. The boots are always hi-top brown boots. The gloves are either dark grey or brown. Leather is preferred for an authentic look.

"
"
Create the shield.,
Carry a sword.,
Use other accessories.",How to Cosplay as Link from Zelda2," Another signature aspect of Link’s appearance is his Hylian shield. Search google images for Link’s shield and print a copy for you to reference. Use a foam board and cut out the outline of the shield.Draw a mock up onto the board before cutting.
Color in the shield’s design with paint and markers.
For extra detail, cut out all the details of the shield with an x-acto knife from a foam board. Then paint the details and use a hot glue gun to position them onto the shield.

, Most Link costumes also have some sort of sword. They are usually kept in a holder attached to your back. You can fashion your own sword by using scrap parts of a foam board. The difficult part is making a realistic handle.


Make sure the handle is blue if you choose to construct your own sword.You can also purchase a cheap plastic sword and paint the handle blue.

, Link doesn’t just carry around a sword and shield. You can get creative with which Link accessories you want to carry. You can use an ocarina for a nice touch that doesn’t require you to build anything. You could also carry a dagger on your waist side.


Link also carries a crossbow and arrows with him in the game. Consider this as an option.
Don’t carry real weapons. It’s easy to get carried away while in costume.

Study his character.,
Act with confidence.,
Have the right posture.,
Have moves prepared.",How to Cosplay as Link from Zelda3," Unfortunately Link was never written any dialogue except for two instances where he said “come on.” Since every other character speaks in the game, many believe he is a mute. This should be even easier for you to mimic! When in doubt shut your mouth., If there is one characteristic trait that you can mimic, it’s being a confident hero. Link never runs from a challenge or says no to others.

, Link bears the spirit of the hero.To convey this in a lifelike cosplay scenario, you must showcase good posture. A trick you can use to help your posture is by imagining a coat hanger on your upper torso.

, Depending on the event you go to, you might need to have a few trademark Link moves up your sleeve. A snapshot of Link’s sounds and attacks is in the Smash Bros game for Nintendo. Do the best you can to make sounds like Link by saying:

”Strike”
”Hyeeeh”
”Kyaah”"

Add some details.",How to Make Samurai Armor," Take a t-shirt and tuck the sleeves inside. Place the shirt onto a large sheet of cardboard and trace around it with a pen, making it longer at the hem. Put the shirt away when you are done.


You are making the chest plate longer because you will be cutting it apart and overlapping it.
You can also use craft foam or EVA foam. The type used on yoga mats may also work.;
, Draw 7 horizontal lines across your pattern to divide it into 8 equal-sized sections. These will make the overlapping horizontal plates.

, The top piece will be F1 and the bottom piece will be F8. This will help you keep track of your pieces. The ""F"" will strand for ""Front."" You will be making another set of plates for the back shortly, Lay the pattern pieces out on a sheet of fake leather. Trace around them, adding ½ to 1-inch (1.27 to 2.54-centimeter) seam allowances. Cut the fake leather out, then clip the corners to help reduce bulk.Cut notches into the collar of the top piece. This will prevent wrinkling.
Number the fake leather pieces on the back so that they match up with the cardboard pieces.

, Lay a piece of fake leather on a flat surface, wrong side up. Coat it with glue, then place a matching cardboard piece on top, number side up. Wrap the edges of the fake leather around the edges of the cardboard piece. Repeat this process for the other pieces.You may need to secure the edges with a fast-dying glue, such as hot glue.
If the fake leather won't stay down, you can secure it with clips.

, This time, number the pieces B1 through B8. You will also want to make the shoulders on the back piece longer. This will make the chest plate easier to assemble.


You can use a similar method to make upper arm pads and a paneled skirt. Make these using a rectangle base.

, You can do this with a hammer and a nail. Each narrow edge needs to have two rows of six holes. Make the holes towards the bottom half of the collar piece (F1). Make the holes towards the top half of the other pieces (F2 through F8). This will allow you to overlap them upwards, like reverse shingles on a roof.You can make more sets of holes down the middle of each chest plate segment for more detail., Cut two long pieces of colored cording. Thread the cords through the first set of holes. Start from the front of the piece so that the cords come out the back. Leave a couple of inches of cording at the front; you'll need this to assemble the armor.Don't worry about the right side of F1 just yet.

, Cross the left cord over and thread it down through the next right hole. Cross the right cord over and thread it down through the next left hole. They should form an X shape., Bring the left cord up through the next left hole. Bring the right cord up through the next right hole. You do not need to cross the cords, since this is the back of the piece., Make sure that the top edge of F2 is covering the bottom edge of F1. Push the cords up through the first set of holes on F2.Don't worry about the right side of the plates just yet.

, Cross the cords, right over left, and bring them down through the next set of holes. Push them up through the left set of holes on F2, and up through the first set of holes on F3. Keep lacing the pieces in this manner until you reach the bottom of F8., Leave a couple of inches/centimeters on each cord. This will allow you to tie the armor together at the waist.

, Once you have that done, you can lace the back plate together. Punch two holes into the top edge of each shoulder on the back piece so that you can assemble the armor later.

, Thread the cord tails from the top of the chest plate (F1) through the holes on the shoulder straps of the back piece (B1). Tie the cords together on each shoulder into a tight knot. If you don't plan on adding any other pieces, trim them off.


If you made arm pads and a skirt, you can lace them together in a similar fashion.
If you made arm pads, use the tails from connecting the shoulder straps to secure them. The cords into knots, then trim them off., Buy a hard hat from the store, and paint it black using spray paint. You don't have to paint the inside, but you should paint the underside of the brim., The strips need to be long enough to extend from the top of the helmet down to the brim. Use a craft blade and a straight edge to make the strips neat and straight. Plan on making them about ⅛ to ¼-inch (0.32 to 0.64-centimeter) wide.You can also use gold cording or ribbon instead.

, You can do this with spray paint or acrylic paint. You only need to paint one side, but you should paint the top and side edges.


If you used gold cord or ribbon, you can skip this step.

, Apply the hot glue directly to the back (unpainted) side of foam piece. Press the foam against the side of the helmet. Hot glue sets up quickly, so only work 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) at a time. Glue all of the strips to the helmet, making sure that they are evenly spaced., Find a fancy coat button and paint it gold to match the vertical strips on the helmet. Hot glue it to the top of the helmet. Not only does this act as an ornament, but it helps hide the part where all of the strips connect., Use the same technique and materials as you did for the chest plate. Cut out four rectangles long enough to wrap around half of the helmet's brim; each one needs to be a little longer than the previous one. Cover and lace them together using the same technique as you did for the chest plate. The shortest rectangle goes on top, and the largest goes on the bottom.For added support, add another set of lacing holes down the middle of each neck protector segment.
If you don't have enough of the base materials left, try one of the following: cardboard, cardstock, poster paper, or craft foam for the base rectangles.
If you don't have enough fake leather left, you can paint the base material to match the helmet instead.

, There are two ways that you can do this. You can punch holes in the bottom of the helmet, then thread the cords from the neck protector through the holes and tie them into knots. You can also glue the neck protector to the back of the helmet using hot glue or industrial-strength glue.

, This is one of the most important features on a samurai helmet. Cut a circle and a crescent moon shape out of craft foam. The crescent needs to be about the same height as the helmet, or taller. The circle needs to be small enough to side inside the crescent, a few inches across.


You can also make the crescent using lines that curve inward then out, like horns., Turn the crescent on its side, so that it looks like a U. Place the circle on top, making sure that the bottom edges match up. Hot glue the circle in place.The circle needs to be small enough to fit inside the moon's cusp.

, You can do this with spray paint or acrylic paint. Make sure that you get the edges of the foam as well. If you want to, you can draw details onto the crescent moon, such as a dragon.

, Place a large swirl of hot glue on the back of the crest. Press it against the helmet, right above the front brim. The prongs of the crescent moon should be pointing upwards.

, You can find them in costume shops and online.You can also make your own by buying a full-face mask from the craft store, then doing the following:


Cut out the mouth in a rectangle shape.
Cut off the top part, about mid-cheeks and up, but leave the nose bridge intact.
Cover the mask with paper mache.
Sculpt over it using paper clay or paper mache paste. Use pictures of real samurai masks for reference.
Paint the mask black.

, If you added teeth to your mask, paint them white. You can also paint the lips reddish, or another dark color. Some masks have mustaches. Gather some stiff bristles and tie them together in the middle with string. Hot glue the mustache to the upper lip, just below the nose. If your mask didn't come with straps, add a strong piece of elastic to the back so that you can wear it under the helmet."

For the hair you can do either and ponytail or plait.,
For her gloves you need to find some dark coloured gloves and cut off the fingers.

,

Decide how you´ll get your cosplay costume.,
If you´ll buy it, always remember: you get what you pay for.,
If you´ll make it yourself, go and try to find suitable materials.,
Get into her personality.",How to Cosplay As Kairi from Kingdom Hearts," You may make it yourself or buy it from a store, but be sure it fits you well and suits you. In KHI Kairi wears a white spaghetti strap top and a lavender velvet skirt. In KHII she wears a pink dress with three silver zippers. In her childhood she wears a white neckholder shirt with a light-purple skirt under it. The one from KHII is the most recognizable one, but then again Kairi is in 3 other games KHI style, so decide freely what suits you the most.;
, The more you spend, the better quality you get. For example, if you buy her school uniform for $39.99, it'll be pretty cheap. If you pay more than $60.00, you'll get amazing quality. But be careful of swindlers on the Internet! If you´ll sew your cosplay by yourself, always try to buy high quality fabric.

, If you chose the outfit from KHI, try to find a white shirt and a black shirt and sew them together. Try to get her bracelets, her belt, her choker, her necklace and the lines at her shirt. For the skirt you have to look closely at the quilling and the left side of it - there the skirt is sliced and you can see a pair of shorts underneath. For the shoes, just wear white slippers and color them up with textile color. You can also add sparkly loops to the mid-toe. If you chose the outfit from KHII, try to find a sleeveless pink dress or sew it from a great piece of textile. Then you should get three zippers (plus a fourth one if you want to sew it in the side of your dress, but that´s optional) and sew them in. The shoes are pretty easy to get: just buy a pair of lavender converses with black soles and white tips, then tie them with a pair of black shoelaces - make sure the laces lace up your calves and tie them in a bow. You also need a white neckholder shirt and a black hood - if you want, make it so you can put it over your head. For the bag, you should try to get a little bag with a lavender ribbon that will fit into the cosplay and some material you can use as holders. She also wears suspender remnants around her waist. Lastly, try to find three bracelets that will fit into her outfit in the colors of blue, black and white.

, Kairi is an outgoing, kind girl who is not afraid to speak out her mind, even if it will anger others. She always smiles at other people and carries many hopes and dreams with her. So should you: try to be always polite and friendly towards others, hug people you are very near to and greet them with all your warmth. Also, try to get a sweet, playful and cheerful behavior, and if you like you can tease friends a bit - but stay playful and make sure they know that you don´t want to hurt them.

Get the costume.,
Style your hair (or wig!).,
Set your makeup.,
Buy contacts if you have to.,
Pick your weapons!,
If you really want to take an extra step, work out.,
Figure out some poses.",How to Cosplay As Rey from Star Wars VI," This is, obviously, the most important part of the outfit. As Rey lives on the harsh desert planet of Jakku, she does not own fancy clothing - it is basic and hardy. Rey's typical everyday outfit - the one we see her wear the most in the movie - consists of:

A grey/tan shirt that reaches to her upper thighs, a little way past her hips. It appears to be a cloth/rough cotton shirt with a v-shaped collar slit and no sleeves, so a long tank top.
A pair of grey/tan cropped cargo trousers that cinch around her knees.
Some grey/tan bandages or cloth strips that are wrapped around her arms or pulled over her arms. These protect Rey from the harsh heat and any danger she may encounter while scavenging. They are tight and stop right at the end of her wrists, stopping at the top a little under her armpits.
A long flowing piece of white fabric that crosses over her shoulders and chest. The fabric is held in place by two brown leather belts that appear to be melded together at the hip. On one side of the bottom belt is a small brown pouch.
A leather wrist cuff, and a pair of boots. The boots are actually a pair of Po Zu Piper V Dark Brown Boots, and are available on the Po Zu website. They are quite expensive, however, so any pair of sturdy ankle boots will do fine. Rey's other outfits are her scavenger gear, which makes a short appearance at the start of the movie. This outfit consists of all of the above items, except Rey wears a brown shawl/wrap of resilient fabric over her head and shoulders, along with a little pair of goggles. She also has her Resistance Base outfit, seen at the end of the movie, which is her shirt, arm guards, and pants, with a grey cloth waistcoat.;
, Rey has short straight dark brown hair, styled in an interesting unique hairstyle of three small buns in a row down the back of her head. Her fringe is pulled back off her face and there are small wisps of hair floating down her face. If you are going to style your hair this way, there are many video tutorials on YouTube - just make sure to muss it up a little to keep it realistic. The makeup artists apparently tied the buns with brown wool to give them a rustic feel. You may have to tighten them from time to time, so it would be a good idea to utilize that pouch with bobby pins/hair grips and hair ties to tie the wool over., Camera flashes and con lights are very unforgiving and will highlight everything, from no matter how far away, so even simple base makeup is integral. In an Allure interview with the makeup artists for the movie, they stated that Daisy wore:

Tom Ford Traceless Foundation, By Terry Brightening CC Lumi-Serum in Sunny Flash, and M.A.C and Skin Illustrator pigments on her face.
A dark brown eyeliner pencil from Bobbi Brown that was 'smudged and smudged', along with Kanebo Sensai 38C mascara, a mascara that is specially designed to last in extreme temperatures and can only be removed with 100F water.
Daisy also had sunscreen on and the makeup artists sterilized sand in hot water before smearing it onto her face. Since Rey is obviously quite grimy and tanned, you may want to invest in some tanning lotion and also a makeup tutorial on how to create fake dirt on yourself.

, Rey's eyes are a green-brown color, and normal contacts will do just fine., Rey is often seen with a serious-looking bo staff (you can choose a stick instead, or buy a staff online) or a blaster, given to her by Han Solo. The blaster is an easier choice for practicality, but the staff is much more iconic. You can always buy both, of course. She also wields Luke's/Anakin's lightsaber in the last part of the movie. The lightsaber was blue and is available online for cheap prices., For the movie, Daisy had an intense fitness regime and packed on a lot of muscle. This is a completely optional step and is up to you - just remember to whip into shape a while before the con if you're making a costume from scratch. This means that when you measure yourself up you'll be the correct body shape and won't have to worry about gaining/losing weight in between., If anyone wants photos with you, they'll be expecting Rey. Common poses are wielding the lightsaber/staff, firing the blaster, crossing your arms, or even just standing to the side while holding the staff. Look up stills of Rey online to get a good feel for everything, and make sure to do a run-through to check you can move okay in the costume. Your pose can also depend on the character you're posing with!"

,  Jessi wears her hair these ways when she is dancing.

,  Since Jessi is a ballerina, she would wear these things routinely.  Another option would be to wear a suit and tie similar to what a guy would wear (but NEVER attempt to create a male bulge in this - keep in mind that Jessi is only eleven years old).  This option relates to book 75 in the series, where she acts in a play and plays a male teacher from the school.

Continue wrapping the pantyhose around the breasts.,
Add five more layers of pantyhose.,
Add some structure or support to the back of the chest plate.,
Create a collar piece, if desired.,
Glue some elastic to the shoulders and sides of the chest plate.,
Add small backpack buckles or Velcro to the end of each elastic.,
Wear the chest plate.",How to Make Fake Breasts," For best results, get the large or extra-large size. Make sure that they have no wires inside and are white. You will be covering these with several layers of pantyhose, so you want a good base color. If you get black or brown, you may have a hard time getting and even color at the end., Stack the two left bra cups together. Make sure that the breast cups are facing in the same direction, then slide them apart slightly so that the bottom part of one cup rests over the center of the other cup. Once you are happy with the breast shape, secure both cups with fabric glue, hot glue, or super glue.Repeat this step for the right set of bra cups.
Set the breast cups aside when you are done.

, Get four to five pairs of extra-large pantyhose that match your skin tone. Cut the legs off, then cut off the toes. Slice apart each leg along one of the seams to form a flat sheet. Discard the toes and seat/waist or save them for another project.


You will need at least seven pairs of pantyhose for this. The larger, the better.
Some types of pantyhose have control tops that extend to the thighs. They will be darker than the rest of the material. You need to cut below this.

, Take one of your pantyhose sheets and drape it over one of your prepared breast cups. Wrap the edges of the pantyhose sheet over the edges of the beast cup. Secure the pantyhose to the underside of the breast cup with a fast-drying glue as you go.Hot glue will work especially well for this step because of how fast it sets up.
Pull the pantyhose taut over the breast so that there are no gaps. It will look sheer, but that's fine.
Start working at one end of the pantyhose. This way, you may have enough left over to cover the other breast.

, Wait for the glue to dry first, if necessary, then flip the breast cup over. Trim off the excess pantyhose as close to the glue line as you can. When you are done, repeat the entire process for the other breast cup.If you have enough pantyhose leftover from the first breast cup, you can use it for the second one. Make sure that the bra cup doesn't show through, however.
Save the remaining pantyhose sheets for later.

, Tuck the sleeves inside the shirt first, so that you have nice, curved edges for the arm holes. Place the shirt on top of the craft foam. Trace around the shirt, including the arm holes, stopping a few inches below each arm pit. This will be the base for your chest plate.


If you can't find craft foam, thin, flexible cardboard may also work. Make sure it's white.
Stay on the safe side, and add a few extra inches to the top of the shoulders.

, Test it over your own chest. The top edges should wrap over your own shoulders. The bottom edge should extend a few inches past your armpit.


Don't worry about it wrapping all the way around your torso.

, Make sure that the breast cups are touching each other in the middle (this forms the cleavage). The top edges of the breast cups should be just below the arm pit of the chest plate. The bottom edges will likely hang over the bottom edge of the chest plate.The thinner part of the breasts should be pointing upwards. The thicker, fuller part should be pointing downwards.

, Once the glue dries, flip the chest plate over. Trim off the excess chest plate until you can see the entire inside of each breast cup again. This will make the breasts more comfortable to wear, especially if you are a girl.

, Drape a pantyhose sheet lengthwise across the breasts. Find center of the top, long edge, and glue it to center of your chest plate's neck. Just a drop will do. Hot glue is recommended for this section because of how fast it sets up.For a neater finish, glue the pantyhose to the underside of the collar, not the front.

, Stretch the bottom edge of the pantyhose sheet across the bottom edge of both breasts. Glue it to the inside edge of each breast. Start with the outer edges first, then work your way to the bottom and inner (cleavage) edges.


Give it an extra tug when you reach the bottom of the cleavage so that you get something that looks like an upside down ""m"".

, Working a little bit at a time, wrap the pantyhose around the outer edge of the chest plate and glue it to the underside. Make sure that you cover the entire collar, shoulders, arm holes, and sides.The covering will be very sheer, and the chest plate may warp. This is fine.

, Using the same technique as before, add five more layers pantyhose sheets to your breasts and chest plate. Make sure that you have no gaps or holes showing, otherwise the skin tone will be uneven. With each layer that you add, you may notice the color getting darker and more consistent., The pantyhose covering will likely cause the chest plate to curve or warp. Flip the chest plate over, and measure from the top of one shoulder down to the top of one breast. Cut a piece of thin cardboard according to that measurement, then glue it to the back of the chest plate. Make sure that it's not visible from the front.Repeat this step for the other shoulder and breast.
You can also use plastic boning, featherlight boning, or thermoplastic/worbla.

, Cut thin strip out of foam. It should be a little longer than your chest plate's collar and a little shorter than your next. Cover it with six layers of pantyhose. Glue it to collar of the chest plate. Make sure that there is an equal amount of foam sticking out on each side. This will wrap around the sides of your neck., Cut four equal lengths of elastic. You will be crossing the elastic pieces over your back in an X shape. Make sure that they are long enough. Hot glue two of the pieces to each shoulder of the chest plate. Hot glue the other two pieces to the sides of the chest plate, right below the arm pits.If your costume will be light colored, use white elastic.
If you added a collar, you will need to glue a short piece of elastic to each side of the collar.
If you are female, you can glue an old bra inside the chest plate. You may need to use extra padding between your bra and the breast cups. Glue the shoulders of the chest plate to the shoulders of your bra., You can use hot glue, but sewing the elastic to the buckles or Velcro would be better. You will be crossing the left shoulder elastic to the right chest elastic, and the right shoulder elastic to the left chest elastic. If you need to, trim and cut the elastic first so that it is short enough to do this.If you added a collar, you will need to add small buckles or Velcro to each elastic.
If you are using an old bra, you can skip this step.

, Place the chest plate over your chest. Cross the elastics across your back in an X-shape and snap (or Velcro) them together. Put on your costume, and adjust it until it rests over the fake breasts naturally. If you need to, use makeup to help match your skin tone to the breasts. You can also get clever with carefully-placed accessories, such as scarves, collars, or necklaces.


If you added a neck piece, then remember to fasten the buckles/Velcro there as well.
If you attached the chest plate to an old bra, then put it on like a bra.

Do not use fake braces as a replacement for real braces.,
Do not wear braces for too long.,
Cease use if you notice signs of tooth damage.,
Refrain from using products containing lead to make fake braces.",How to Make Fake Braces or a Fake Retainer," Before you start making your fake braces, you'll need to gather some materials. To make fake braces, you'll need the following:


A bobby pin
A small rubber band
Butterfly earring backs
A pair of pliers
Scissors
Silly bands in multiple colors, if you want colored braces
A hot glue gun;
, To start, unbend your bobby pin. Fold it outward, forming a 90 degree angle. Bobby pins are not very strong, so you should be able to do this with your fingers., You want your bobby pin as straight as possible. This will help your fake braces look realistic. Use your pliers to form a straight line with your bobby pin. Then, use the pliers to smooth out any waves or wiggles in the pin.Have patience. This can take quite awhile depending on how uneven your bobby pin is.
The straighter you make your bobby pin, the more realistic your fake braces will look when you put them in your mouth.

, Once the bobby pin has formed a straight line, wash the pin with antibacterial soap in warm water. As you'll be putting the bobby pin in your mouth, you want it to be clean. Pliers can be very dirty. Then, set the bobby pin aside until it's dry to the touch. Bobby pins are not very big, so this should not take too long., From here, use your fingers to bend the bobby pin into a U-shape that fits in your mouth. It can help to place the bobby pin in your mouth and shape it around the curve of your top teeth. Make sure the curve is smooth, as this will help the braces look more realistic., Now you will need to add the earring backs to the bobby pin. Place about four earring backs along the bobby pin, so the flat backs of the earring backs are facing your teeth. You want to place the earring backs so each back fits over the front of one of your teeth. You may have to put the bobby pin in your mouth on occasion to gauge where to place the earring backs. This can take a long time, as earring backs may slip off easily. Be patient. Snap on the earring back at equal distances.Butterfly earring backs have two small loops on the front. The idea is to push the bobby pin into the space between these loops. This can be difficult, so go slowly. Do not be surprised if the earring backs occasionally slip out of your hand.
Four earring backs should be sufficient to create fake braces. However, if you have a wider mouth, you may need slightly more earring backs. You'll need enough earring backs to cover all your teeth when you smile.

, Earring backs slip off easily, so you will want to put a dab of hot glue on each earring back. This will help them stay attached to the bobby pin.Make sure the glue dries completely before continuing to construct your fake braces.

, If you want to add some color to your braces, take a silly band. Push one end of the band through a loop in the earring back. Then, move the silly band around the earring back and pull it through the other loop. Trim excess silly band and repeat the process with all the other earring backs.You may have to trim down the end of a silly band with your scissors so it forms a point. This way, it'll be easier to slip through the earring loop.
This step is optional. If you do not want colored braces, you can skip it.

, Take your small rubber band. Loop it around the ends of the bobby pin. This holds the braces in a u-shape. It also provides a way to hinge the braces in your mouth. Your fake braces should look something like a ""D"" shape once you've looped the rubber band in place.It's a good idea to secure the rubber band by bending both sharp ends of the bobby pins into a small loop. Not only does this keep the rubber band from moving, it eliminates some of the sharper aspects of the fake braces. You do not want anything too pointy in your mouth for long.

, Now, you can place the braces in your mouth. Push the loop over your teeth. Place the rubber band between two teeth in the back of your mouth on both sides of your mouth to secure the fake braces in place., Now, you can make a fake retainer to go with your fake braces. To start, gather your materials. You do not need much for this project other than hot water and wax containers.You'll need wax bottles that contain juice. You can buy such bottles at a local supermarket or even a craft store. Packages usually contain multiple bottles, so you can make many different fake retainers with a bottle.
You'll also need access to hot water. If you want to add color to your retainer, you'll need food coloring in your chosen color.

, To start, bite off the top of the juice bottle. Then, squeeze out the juice. You can drink it if you want, or you can squeeze it down the drain. Make sure you get every drop of juice out of the bottle., Now, use your hands to roll the bottle into a tight ball. It can be helpful to roll the bottle sideways first between your hands, creating a long cylinder. Then, roll up the cylinder to form a spiral. Squash this spiral between your hands and then roll it between your palms until it forms a small, tight circle., Run the tap water in your bathroom until it becomes hot to the touch. Place the ball in the sink underneath the running water. Leave it in place for 60 to 90 seconds. To test if the balls is ready, touch it. It should be soft and easily moldable., You may want to let the ball cool slightly first if it is very hot. You do not want to burn your mouth or tongue. Then, place the wax ball in your mouth. Use your tongue and fingers to flatten it against the roof of your mouth. Keep flattening and molding the wax until it fits comfortably in the roof of your mouth., Now, put in your fake braces. You should have a nice braces/retainer look. This can work well for a costume or to wear to school if you feel like having braces for a day.

, Many people have dyed or colorful retainers. If you want yours to look more realistic, take food coloring and mix with water. Add enough food coloring so the water takes on the color you want. Then, submerge your fake retainer in the food coloring for about 10 minutes., Fake braces can be fun for a costume. However, they cannot replace actual braces. If you need braces, or are worried that you do, ask your parents to make an appointment with your orthodontist. Never use fake braces instead of actual braces. Fake braces will not correct damage such as crooked teeth.

, Fake braces can cause tooth damage over time. You should not leave them in for long periods. Stick to wearing them on special occasions, like a costume party. If your teeth or mouth feel sore, remove the braces.You should also work on eliminating sharp parts of your fake braces. Make sure the flat backs of your earring backs are pressed on your teeth. You should also bend the ends of the bobby pin inward to lessen the pointy effect.

, Fake braces can accumulate food and cause a buildup of plaque. If you notice things like yellow teeth or sore gums, your fake braces may be damaging your teeth. Cease use immediately and make an appointment with your dentist., Read the labels on any products you use in fake braces. Products containing lead should be avoided. Using lead products in your mouth can lead to poisoning."

Cut a neckline from a tan or brown pillowcase.,

Trim the costume, if necessary.,
Create fringe along the bottom.,
Attach fringe to the neckline.,
Decorate as desired.",How to Make an Indian Costume1," Use scissors to cut out a half-moon shape from the folded bottom of a pillowcase. The cut should be large enough to fit the intended wearer's head through.


Lay the pillowcase flat and trace the desired shape with a pencil before cutting. Center the half-moon along the edge.
For a young child, the half-moon should be about 6 inches (15 cm) long by 3 inches (7.5 cm) tall. For an adult or older child, measure the width of the wearer's neck to determine how long the neckline needs to be.
You can use a flat, round object, such as a plate, to trace the half-moon or half-circle.
Ask the intended wearer to slip the pillowcase on over his or her head. If the wearer's head cannot fit through the neckline, make it a little larger and try again.
If you want to save time, use a tan or brown t-shirt instead of a pillowcase. This will save you the effort of creating necklines and armholes, but you will need to cut the sleeves off of the shirt before proceeding.;
, Cut two more half-moon shapes along both sides of your pillowcase, near the folded top of the material. Make sure that the holes are large enough for the intended wearer to fit his or her arms through.


The armholes should be evenly positioned and approximately 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) down from the top of the pillowcase.
For a young child, the half-moon shapes should be about 3 inches (7.5 cm) long and 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) wide. For an adult or older child, measure the thickest part of the upper arm to determine how long the hole needs to be.
Instruct the intended wearer to slip the pillowcase on. If his or her arms do not fit through the holes, make the holes bigger.

, Make 1.5-inch (3.8-cm) slits along both armholes to create fringe. For the best results, space the slits about 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) apart. Continue around both armholes so that the fringe goes all the way around.


You can also glue small strips of store-bought fringe around the arm holes.

, A pillowcase tunic should be short enough to fit older kids and adults, but it might be too long for younger children. Have the child try the costume on, so you can decide if it’s the right length.


If the pillowcase extends below the mid-calf, trim it with scissors. Otherwise, your child may trip over it.

, Make 3-inch (7.5-cm) slits along the entire open bottom of the pillowcase to create fringe. It helps to lay the pillowcase flat rather than to hold it as you cut. Make sure to use sharp scissors, and space the slits about 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) apart.


Be sure to make slits around the entire open bottom of the pillowcase so the fringe spans the entire hem of the tunic.

, Use fabric glue to attach store-bought or homemade fringe around the neckline.You can make your own fringe by using a 2-inch (5-cm) wide strip of extra pillowcase fabric or brown felt. Cut the store-bought fringe or homemade strip into a half-moon shape the same length as the neckline. For homemade fringe, cut 1.5-inch (3.8-cm) slits along the length of the strip, spacing them 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) apart from one another.


Attach the fringe by applying the fabric glue to the non-fringed portion of the fabric strip. The fringes should face down and away from the neck rather than up and over it.

, One of the simplest ways to decorate the tunic is with colorful triangles along the open base. Cut some craft sponges into 2-inch (5-cm) tall triangles, leaving the edges fairly rough or jagged. Dip the triangles into fabric paint in shades such as red, orange, yellow, and green, and apply it to the tunic in a pattern of your choosing.


For a simple look, decorate the open bottom of the pillowcase with a row of upside-down triangles. Place the row about 4 inches (10 cm) from the open end, and space the triangles about 1-inch (2.5 cm) apart from one another.
Give your tunic more color by adding a row of right-side-up triangles above your first row of upside-down triangles. Use a second triangle-shaped sponge and a different paint color. Make sure to position each right-side-up triangle between two upside-down triangles.
Whatever pattern you choose, repeat it on both sides of the pillowcase. Be sure that the first side is dry before decorating the second, though.

Gather your cloth.,

Cut the outline.,
Use cardboard for support.,
Measure your head.,
Prepare the string.,
Use a hair tie.,
Test it on yourself.,
Prepare a hole.,
Attach the string.,
Wear the patch.",How to Make an Eyepatch," A traditional eyepatch is made out of black cloth. You can use the cloth of your choice. A popular material is canvas, but this isn’t the most comfortable. You could instead use a fabric that is soft like cotton, if you plan to wear the patch for an extended time period.You can also gather scrap cardboard if you choose to use it.;
, Use a ruler to measure one of your eyes and the surrounding area. Most eyepatches will extend from your eyebrows to below your eyes. Measure from your eyebrows to the top of your cheek bone for the vertical distance. Then measure from the center of your nose to the other side of your eye for the horizontal distance. Jot these measurements down on paper.


After gauging how large you want your eyepatch, measure and draw the dimensions onto the cloth. You can use chalk to best see your outline.Create a sunglass lens shape out of the rectangle. Be sure to hit the edges of the rectangle when drawing your outline.

, Use sewing scissors to cut out your eyepatch.Once you have your patch cut, use a lighter to burn away any of the frayed strings left behind. Removing the frayed strings will create a cleaner looking eyepatch.

, To create a stiff eyepatch that will look dramatic, you can attach a piece of cardboard to the backside of the eyepatch. Lay the eyepatch onto a piece of clean cardboard. Then trace the patch onto the cardboard using a pen. Now cut out the cardboard.


Glue the patch onto the cardboard using standard glue or a hot glue gun. Use more fabric than is needed to completely cover the cardboard, and curl the excess fabric onto the back side of the cardboard so that the front of the patch is seamless.
This isn't necessary, but it might look more believable than just using cloth.

, Use a seamstress’ measuring tape to measure your head. Take note of your dimensions. When preparing the string you should leave extra slack to account for attaching and adjustments.

, Use black string for an authentic look. Measure out your string to the same length you documented for your head. Remember to leave about two inches of slack for tying knots and adjustments.


If black string isn't available, use whatever you have. Darker colors work best.

, Some hair ties will work as a string for your eyepatch. If you find that your hair tie is too small, use a headband. Cut whichever type of band you use so that it is in the shape of a string.


You can also rip an elastic band out of an old pair of pants.

, Before attaching the string to the eyepatch, try wearing it by using your hands to hold everything in place. This will help you gauge if the string is the right dimension.


Make adjustments if needed., You can either create a hole to tie the string, or glue the string onto the patch. If you decide to make inserts into the patch, use a sharp knife. Create small holes on the far left and right side of the patch.


If you decide to glue, prepare a hot glue gun or superglue., Tie a small overhand knot if you created holes. Make sure you took into account the slack needed to attach the string. Use a hot glue gun or superglue to attach the string. Glue your string behind the front of the patch to create a sleeker look., Eyepatches are classic accessories for a variety of costumes. Slip the eyepatch over your head and you have your very own eyepatch.


For decorations, you can color onto the patch using a white marker. A classic costume decor is the pirates flag.

Pick a color.,
Choose a type of fabric.,
Get the right length.,
Go for a sheet.,
Wash the fabric.",How to Make a Toga1," Typically, adult Roman males wore an off-white color for their togas. The color was that of the un-dyed fabric. However, other colors were worn, though they typically denoted something specific about the person wearing them.For instance, if the toga was truly white because the fabric was bleached, that generally indicated the person was in public office.Dark colors indicated the person was in mourning.White with a purple border was worn by curule magistrates, while purple with a gold thread around the border was worn, at different times, by generals (although only those who had won battles and wars), kings, and emperors.;
, The Romans wore wool,mainly because it stayed in place better than other fabrics. However, wool can be itchy, as well as very warm. In addition, wool is an expensive fabric. If you want something cheaper, a cotton blend should be fine.Muslin is a good option, because it is light and flowing.Another option is any flannel that is flowing.You can find both of these fabrics at your local fabric store. Basically, you don't want anything too smooth because it will slip right off.

, A true toga requires about 4 to 5 yards (4 to 5 m) of fabric, depending on your height and build. If you're a bit larger, you may want to spring for 6 yards (5.5 m), just in case.At the fabric store, you can specify how much fabric you want.
Sometimes, if you get the end of a bolt, the store will give you a discount on buying the rest of the bolt passed what you ordered to be cut. For instance, if you ask for 4 yards and the bolt has 4 3/4 yards, the store may give you a discount if you want that extra 3/4 of a yard.

, Another, easier option is to use a simple bed sheet. While you don't get as much length as a traditional toga, it can be a simple way to create a toga.A queen is a good size. It's slightly longer than a full, but it doesn't have as much width as a king.
Some people prefer a twin or full because it doesn't add as much bulk.

, It can help to wash and dry the fabric. Washing it makes it softer, which can help it flow better.Try adding a fabric softener to help with the process.
You can run it through the washing machine twice if once doesn't soften it up enough to drape well.

You’ll also need pieces of felt in complementary colors, such as white and pink, as well as some cotton stuffing, which is available at your local fabric or craft supply store.


You’ll also need a sharp pair of scissors, sewing machine or needle and thread, and some pins.
Alternately, you can use a glue gun to attach pieces to the hoodie, instead of sewing them on.;
, Cut equal numbers of felt, measuring 9 inches long and 2 inches wide. Cut enough pieces to cover from the crown of the hood (about 4” from the front top of the hood) to the bottom hem of the hoodie, laying them lengthways., Fold each felt piece into a circle by joining the short ends together. Overlap the pieces by about one inch. Pin these pieces along the backside of the hoodie.


Use a zigzag stitch on your sewing machine to attach the pieces to the hoodie. Alternately, sew this by hand.
You can also attach these pieces with safety pins on the inside of the hoodie. This will enable you to reuse the hoodie without the unicorn features.Cover the safety pins with duct tape to ensure that the costume wearer won’t get poked by pins if they accidentally open up.

, Once the mane is attached to the hoodie, cut the looped ends with your scissors, making 3 cuts lengthways on each loop. Then cut each loop open so that you have a frayed-looking mane.

, Cut two triangles of felt in one color such as white, and cut two triangles in another color such as pink. The white triangles should be larger than the pink triangles, and the white ones should be about the size of the palm of your hand.


Layer a white and pink triangle together, with the white on the bottom. Sew the two triangles together by sewing along the center. Do the same for the other set of triangles.

, Place the ears on each side of the mane a couple of inches back from the front edge of the hood. Pin them in place. Try on the hoodie to check for placement. Stitch them in place using a needle and thread, or use safety pins on the inside of the hood to attach them.

, The horn is the essential part of the costume. Cut a large triangle out of white felt. The triangle should be a couple of inches longer than the length of the hood. Fold the triangle together lengthwise and stitch it closed. This will form the cone shape of the unicorn horn.


Fill the horn with cotton stuffing. Use a knitting needle or pencil to push stuffing into the point of the horn. Make sure the horn is evenly stuffed but not overstuffed.

, Pin the horn in place on the very top center of the hoodie. Try on the hoodie to check for placement. Take the hoodie off, and using a matching color of thread, hand stitch the horn in place.


Use a whipstitch to secure the horn in place. To do a whipstitch, poke the needle through the underside of the hoodie and bring it up through the hoodie and through the horn felt. Then poke the needle through the hoodie just under the base of the horn and back up through the felt. This makes a loop of thread that will secure the horn in place.Stitch all around the base of the horn.

, Cut long, thin pieces of felt that will extend down to the knees when your costume is on. These can be a combination of colors. Gather the pieces together at one of the short ends and stitch them to the center back base of the hoodie.

, Put on the hoodie and zip it up. Complete the costume with matching or complementary pants or leggings, shoes, and gloves.


You can also paint your face to look like a unicorn.

, Draw the circles first, then use a craft knife on a safe cutting surface to cut out the circles.

, Use a pencil or the end of scissors to make the holes.

, Tie one end around the hole and leave the other end dangling. Be sure to use good lengths of twine or rope (see next step).

, However, leave enough space in between for your body, as one circle will sit on your back, one on your front. The twine or rope sits over your shoulders, so keep this in mind when deciding on the final length.

, Using leftover pieces of cardboard, cut out shapes that resemble stylized depictions of the sun's rays.

, If gluing on, allow to dry before proceeding to the next step.

, Mostly yellow but some orange and red touches to heat it up are fine.

If you do not have blonde hair, then invest in a reasonable length and style blonde wig and tie two Junko style bunches in her hairstyle.",How to Cosplay As Junko Enoshima," This will need to be folded over the cardigan on completion.;
, You will need a deep neck three quarter sleeve black cardigan or jumper. To this black cardigan, add a red bow tie to the left hand side on the neck of the collar, near where the breast pocket of a man's shirt would be, securing this firmly with a pin.

,


Fold both white shirt and black cardigan sleeve to elbow length.
Pop the collar and leave it up and exposed as much as possible around neck area. If this is difficult, an idea may be to get a larger size then simply wear a corset (hardcore cosplayers) or tight strapless vest (amateur level) over the white shirt under the jumper. This keeps the body shape you want, while giving you enough collar to show.

, Simply tie a loose white tie and place around the neck at the appropriate length.

, Use a red skirt (preferably in a straight or a line design in either cotton or velvet, appliqué different size black strips of velvet and cotton in a tartan design across skirt. Be sure to get a large pleated skirt.

, Replace black string with red string for black knee high lace up heeled boots and tie in a bow.

Find an old pair of tan khaki pants.,
Create fringe for the sides.,
Attach the fringe to the pants.",How to Make an Indian Costume2," For best results, choose a pair that is roughly the same shade as the pillowcase used for the tunic. The pants should be fairly tight rather than baggy. Semi-baggy pants will work as long as they fit, but pants that are just wide enough to slip on and off are ideal. If desired, you can slim the pants by having the intended wearer try them on and pinning along the sides to desired tightness. Turn the pants inside out and sew along the pin-line. Finally, cut off the excess material and turn the pants right-side-out again.

, Cut two long strips of canvas, felt, or another strong fabric in a shade that matches the pants as closely as possible. The strips should be long enough to extend from the waist to the hem of the pants along the sides. To create the fringe, cut 1-inch (2.5-cm) slits along one side of the strip. Space the slits approximately a 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) apart.The strips should be about 1.5 inches (3.8-cm) wide.
If you’re short on time, you can also use store-bought fringe.

, Use fabric glue or a needle and thread to attach the strips of fringe to the sides of both pant legs. If you want to make sure that the pants can be worn multiple times, it’s best to sew on the fringe. Glue or sew along the 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) wide section of the band that does not have fringe on it, and apply it over the side seam on each pants leg.
If you prefer to wear a skirt with your costume, add the fringe all along the hem of a brown or tan skirt instead.

Wear brown flats or boots.,
Create a feather headband.,
Add a belt, if desired.",How to Make an Indian Costume3," Moccasins are the best option, but a simple flat, brown slip-on shoe would coordinate with the look. Basic brown suede boots would also work as long as they have a flat sole. Fur-lined or fringed boots can add some flair to your costume.If you do not expect to walk through mud puddles, you can also wear moccasin-style slippers.
Simple brown sandals could also work as long as they are not embellished with other decorations.

, Start with a brown cloth headband that wraps around the head rather than over it. Use a hot glue gun to attach one to three feathers to the inside of the headband. Position them so they are at the side of the head and behind the ear.If you cannot find a brown wrap-around headband, cut a strip of stretchy brown fabric that is long enough to fit around the wearer's head and add an extra 1-inch (2.5-cm) to the length. Loop the strip of fabric around to create a band, using fabric glue or hot glue to secure the extra 1-inch (2.5-cm) of fabric over the other end of the band.
If you want to give your headband extra flair, decorate it with wooden beads, colorful seed beads, or craft paint.

, If you want to add a little extra shape to your tunic, tie a braided leather sash around the wearer's waist. If you can’t find a sash or belt without a buckle, cut a strip of brown leather, canvas, or brown rope that is long enough to wrap around the waist. Make sure to cut enough extra material so you can tie the belt into a loose bow at the front of the costume.


A fringed leather belt can add an attractive touch to your costume too.

, A sari is a type of traditional, draping cloth worn by Indian women, but you can create your own with a piece of fabric. Inexpensive acetate that’s usually used for lining garments works well to make your own sari. For a child’s costume, cut the fabric so it's 30-inches wide and and 3-yards long. For adults, go with fabric that’s 45 inches wide and 6 yards long.Choose a bold color for your fabric. Jewel tones, such as emerald, ruby, or sapphire, are attractive shade options for a sari.

, To make it easier to wrap the sari, wear your cropped top with a pair of leggings or stretchy bike shorts in a neutral color. Take one end of the fabric and tuck it into the back of your leggings. Create a pleat in the fabric, and tuck the next section into the waistband, repeating the action all the way around your waist. Drape the excess fabric over your shoulder, folding from the back to the front.When you tuck the fabric into your waistband, the hem should cover your feet but rest above the floor.
Aim for approximately 7 to 10 pleats when you’re tucking in the fabric. The pleats should fall straight and point to your left.
When you drape the remaining length of fabric over you, it should be somewhere between knee-length and floor-length.
If you’re worried about your sari coming loose, secure it in place with pins.
Compliment your sari with gold or silver bangle bracelets, gold or silver hoop earrings, and flat sandals.

Decide if and how you want to sew your fabric.,
Cut the toga.,
Hem the edges.,
Use fabric adhesive.",How to Make a Toga2," You can use the fabric just as it is. However, you can also sew it to make a toga that is more in line with a traditional shape. Another option is to simply hem the edges.


While it won't matter with some fabrics, hemming the edges will keep your toga from fraying. If you don't care about fraying, you can skip the hemming process.

, The shape of the toga changed over the years. You can cut your toga to be more like a traditional toga, if you want. However, you can simply leave it as a rectangle, as well, which is how you will get it from the store.One shape was a straight line across the top and a curve across the bottom, creating pointed ends.A later shape was more of a hexagon, with a straight line across the top, with two lines slanting down to points. The bottom was a straight line with two lines slanting up to the same points, though these are slightly curved. This shape is flatter than an regular hexagon.If you want either of these shapes, cut the fabric with fabric scissors, leaving about 2 1⁄4 inches (5.7 cm) around the sides to hem the fabric.

, Whether you are hemming the edges of the rectangle or of the toga you cut out, you can use a simple double-folded hem.If you have any curved edges, you might need to take one extra step of sewing along it before folding.Iron the edge.


To hem the raw edges, fold the fabric in about 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm).If you're hemming a curved edge, you can make this part easier by sewing along the edge first, about 3/4 of an inch in, then fold it along that line.Iron the edge.
Fold it in again, this time about about 1 1/2 of an inch in. Iron it again.Sew along the inside edge. To tack the hem down, sew it down, closer to the inside edge than the outside edge.You can also sew small weights into the hem to help it hang better., If you prefer not to sew, you can use fabric adhesive. Iron the hem first, folding it over twice like you would if you were sewing. Then either use a liquid adhesive or an iron-hem tape to glue it down.If you use the hem tape, you'll probably need to iron the outside of the fabric to make it stick.
Make sure to not make the glue too thick, or it can show through the other side. Test it first to see how it looks.

Start with your left arm.,
Drape the other part around your back.,
Wrap it across the front of your body.,
Wrap it around again.,
Adjust the toga.,
Accessorize your toga.",How to Make a Toga3," Take one corner or edge, and fold it over your left arm from the back. It should hang down pretty far, past your knee.








If you used the hexagon shape, you'll need to fold it in half first.The Romans usually wore at least a tunic underneath their togas. You can wear a shirt and shorts/pants or a skirt to help cover up., Pull the rest of the fabric around your back. The part that drapes around the top of your shoulder








You might need some help at this stage, since the fabric is so long.

, Pull the fabric around the front of your body, leaving enough to drape down your right side. Throw the rest of the fabric over your shoulder.








Make sure the fabric drapes around your hip. You don't want it to be too tight.
Also, this step makes the length of your toga, so make sure it is long enough. The next step will partly cover your torso.

, Come around your right side a second time, again under your right arm. Let it drape down your right side, a little higher than the first time. Throw the end over your shoulder again.








The point should be a bit higher in back than it is in front.

, Look in the mirror, and adjust the drape. You may need to pull it in places so it covers more. Lengthen or shorten the ends as needed. You can also pin it to help in stay in place.








A good place to pin it is on the left shoulder.
Though the Romans usually didn't pin their togas, pinning it will give you more freedom to move, as the toga was fairly restrictive.
You can also use a belt to help hold it in place.

, You can use plastic swords and shields that can be purchased at a dollar store, toy store, or costume store. You may also look for fake gold chains, jewelry, or amulets to accessorize your toga. Wear sandals to complete the look.








Another option is to create a fake laurel wreath. Unfurl a wire coat hanger, and reshape it into a wreath around your head. Get plastic leaves from an art supply store or gather real leaves and glue them or wrap around the wire. Make sure you let the glue dry. Be liberal when applying the leaves to cover the wire."
"
Fold the sheet.,
Drape one end over the left arm.,
Pull it under your right arm.,
Throw the rest over your shoulder.",How to Make a Toga4," How far you fold it depends on your preference. Nonetheless, it should be folded approximately in half lengthwise.If you use a twin or a full sheet, you don't need to fold the toga.








If you fold it exactly in half, you will make a very short toga.For a longer toga, don't go all the way down when folding it. Just fold it partway.Remember, togas were generally worn over tunics, so you can wear it over a shirt or some other type of garment or even your regular clothes. Using a sheet, in particular, creates a fairly skimpy toga, so you probably want to wear something under it.

, You can drape the whole edge over the left arm. This end will hang down in front.Another option is just draping the the top corner over so it forms a point.








If you're draping the toga yourself, the easiest way to do this step is to throw the whole sheet over your shoulders like a cape, lengthwise. On your left side, pull it so just the end is hanging over your arm, then pull up the slack on the other side., Now that you've got it draped on the left side, pull it under your right arm.You can leave it over your right arm, as the Romans sometimes wore togas almost like a sling, but you'll have more movement if you pull it under.








Try to gently pleat the part that goes under your arm. That is, when it comes around your hip from the back, use your hands to fold the fabric back and forth, so it drapes in small folds., Finally, take the end and push it over your left shoulder. Try to get as much of it over your shoulder, while still pulling the right side down over your hip somewhat.








Though the Romans didn't usually pin their togas, you can use a safety pin to pin it at the shoulder. That way, it won't slip off."

Attach the ears to the headband.",How to Make a Unicorn Costume3," Fashioning a unicorn horn and ears to a headband will make an instant costume. For this project, you’ll need a headband, felt (white and pink), cotton stuffing, thick gold thread and a glue gun. These supplies are available at a fabric or craft supply store.


You can also use a piece of ribbon or elastic instead of the headband, although it might not stay on your head as well., Cut out a large triangle from a piece of white felt. The triangle should be about the same height as the headband, and the bottom end of the triangle should be about 2-3 inches in diameter.


Roll the felt into a conical shape. Use the hot glue gun to glue the horn in place.You can also sew the horn into a conical shape.
Stuff the horn with cotton stuffing. Use a knitting needle or a pencil to poke the stuffing into the tip of the horn.

, To make the horn look more magical, wrap the thick golden thread around the horn in a spiral pattern. Glue one end of the thread to the top of the horn and wind the thread around the horn over and over until you reach the bottom of the horn. Glue the horn to the bottom of the horn.


Tighten the gold thread slightly so that the horn is squeezed a little bit.

, Cut out a circle of felt just slightly larger than the bottom of the horn. Place the headband in between the horn and the felt circle. Glue the circle to the horn and the headband.

, Cut out two sets of the bottom layer of the ears. Use white felt in double-layer tear shape, approximately 3 inches long. Keep the bottom of the double layer uncut, so that when you unfold the layers, you have two tear shapes reflecting each other. Cut two more ears from the pink felt, also in the tear shape, in single layers. These should be slightly smaller than the white ears., Wrap the white ears around the headband on either side of the unicorn horn. Glue the bottom folded part onto the underside of the headband’s top. Glue the ear tops together. Add the pink ears onto the white ears, facing forward, and glue them in place.

, Braces are like suspenders but they button to your trousers. They can be purchased at a formal store or online for relatively cheap. Jack wears red, grey, or cream braces and they are essential to the Jack Harkness look.

, This can be purchased for 35 quid online or from a military surplus store. It is known as an RAF Great Coat. Otherwise, sew some officers patches onto a similar-looking gray wool coat.

Vocaloid is meant to be interpreted in each fan's own way. Do not fret if you can't find a 100% perfect pair of pants, wig, shirt, etc, because Vocaloid is all about being spontaneous, creative and true to yourself!
, In order to do this cosplay, you will need a proper wig. These wigs can be ordered from websites as simple as Ebay, Amazon, or even Cosplay.com. (If you already have dyed your hair green you can skip this step.) Any wig that is green will be suitable. Although, if you don't feel comfortable with styling your wig, look for a shorter wig such as the one shown in the photo., Although many people may find the makeup for this cosplay challenging, it is actually not that difficult to do as it is simply a round circle under each eye made of either eyeliner or paint. You can also add eyeshadow of any desired color! This is to give the cosplayer the effect of ""panda-eyes"", which corresponds to the title of the song, Panda Hero. Also, feel free to add lip-gloss or lipstick for a small extra-touch., The shirt for this cosplay is just a thick-strapped black tank top. If you can't find one like this, a spaghetti strapped ""cami"" can also work., Gumi has the words ""PANDA HERO"" in bold capital letters running down her arm. Although there is no way to be sure of which arm, it appears on her left arm in most photos. These letters can be made using paint, duct tape, stickers, and many other options., Gumi's gloves are fairly simple, they are just gloves that are cut off at the fingers and often have two pink stripes at the wrists. You do not need to buy cut off gloves, but simply cut them yourself at the fingers and sew in pink yarn or use fabric paint., This part may be the hardest because there is no 100% correct way to be sure of what Gumi actually wears! Many photos feature her in cargos, short-shorts, khakis, and camouflage pants. It's up to you!, Gumi's shoes for this are usually portrayed as ankle-high converse tennis shoes of any color. Purple, green, pink, black, any color., The hat that Gumi wears here is a half orange and half black ""baseball cap"" or ""snap-back"" that can be easily made.

Take a black baseball cap and orange fabric paint.
Draw a line on the side of the hat and cross it over the button on the top of the hat and over the other side of the hat (parallel with the bill of the hat).
Fill in the space you drew between the line and bill with orange fabric paint, but not the bill itself!

, The goggles Gumi wears here are hard to find, but some things as simple as motorcycle goggles and ""Steampunk"" goggles are just as fitting for hers. Here, hers are just black with pink lenses, which can honestly be easily made from even swim goggles since they just rest on her hat and are not actually worn., While searching for reference photos, you probably noticed Gumi is blowing a blue bubble with a mouth on it. To make this, simply locate a blue balloon and paint or draw with a marker a face on it with an open mouth (optional)., Gumi often is seen with a baseball bat for Panda Hero, too. If you plan on cosplaying in an area where a baseball bat is allowed, use a metal bat which is white or black and paint the words ""PANDA HERO"" on it. If you plan on attending a convention, make a bat of foam or plastic (depending on your resources) (optional)."

Work on acting like her: be clumsy, be bad at sports, be shy, never spend to much time in your house, jut your chin out when you're angry/arguing/running on 'stubborn mode', have to be pretty smart, be nice, loyal to your friends, do more cleaning around the house than you usually do, and maybe cook dinner for your family every once in a while, be curious and observant.,
Look like her: if you don't have the same hair color it's OK (you don't have to be an exact replica of her, unless you want to be), if so than you should die your have a nice natural looking dark brown.,
Try makeup to give you a heart shaped face if you don't already have one.,
Put together an outfit to dress like Bella you need a few things.,
You should also get your own style of scrawly writing.,
Read the classics, Like Jane Eyre or Romeo and Juliet.

,
Listen to rock like Linkin park.,
Get similar jewelry.",How to Cosplay As Isabella Swan," You most probably have to be a deep thinker or an introvert to be Bella. Keep away from attention, remember: Bella doesn't like attention. Be selfless, bite your nails, help out (even when not asked). Don't be afraid to get your hands dirty. Be thankful for what you've got (even if its little). And be strong minded/willed and tough but sensitive. Don't swear. Bella sleeps well and sleep talks but I don't know how you can change that (but you could probably find something on it through the Internet).


Bella addresses her mom as 'Renee' and her dad as 'Charlie', to their face call them mom and dad. But I probably wouldn't call your parent/s by their first name unless you're contemplating suicide.;
, Bella has either straight or curly/wavy hair a couple inches past shoulder length. So its good if you naturally have wavy hair. If she doesn't feel like doing anything to it than she will just put it up into a ponytail. Her eyebrows a little darker than her hair and more straight than they are arched.

, A wide forehead with a widow's peak, large, wide-spaced eyes, prominent cheekbones, and then a thin nose and a narrow jaw with a pointed chin. She has chocolate brown eyes and a fair complexion. Her lips are a little out of proportion; a bit too full for her jaw line.

, First you need to get a lot of boot-cut jeans and straight-leg jeans, that is what Bella wore. No skinny jeans. Next, Bella wears a lot of old looking tops; nothing in style (she doesn't keep up with what's in style or not). She wears long sleeve under a short sleeve. A lot of button down over shirts. The one thing she cares about with her clothing choice for the day is that her outfit at least matches. Another thing is that she wears nothing designer, strictly name brand and older stuff she's had for a while. Then, she also wears different shoes. She has her rain boots, hiking boots, black and white vans(NOT CHECKERED), her converse. She has around two or three jackets (one with a zip) and a few sweaters (living in Forks and all). Another tip I can give you is that her wardrobe sticks to mainly earth tones.


Bella also dresses in just cheap, simple name brand clothing. She wears jeans practically everyday. When she wants to get comfy at home she will switch into her favorite sweat pants. Bella normally wears blouses, plain t-shirts, or some old clothes shes had. Also she uses Strawberry Shampoo (I don't know which brand).

, Or maybe even memorise Bella's. Bella's handwriting is in Pablo font. There are also sites that offer insight into someones personality through their handwriting. Maybe you could try that out. It may not be exactly right because Bella's handwriting is a computer font therefore not a persons personality written into the form of letters.

,, Maybe even throw a bit of Stephenie in there and get to know Muse (Stephenie Meyers favourite band) a little bit more.

, Bella wears a silver ring with a moonstone on it and she wears that on her right index finger.

Dye your hair dark red.,
Cut your hair into side swept bangs.,
Straighten your hair with a flat iron.",How to Cosplay As Erza Scarlet1," You’ll want to choose a deep, somewhat dark red for the right look. You can go to a stylist to have it professionally done, or you can purchase a home dye kit. It’s good to take a picture with you to the stylist so that he or she can match the color to how you want it.


If you do not want the expense and long term commitment of dying your hair, you can simply purchase a wig similar to Erza’s hair. When you dress with this option, be sure that your own hair is kept up tightly under the wig.;
, Again, if you don’t want to style your own hair, try to find a wig that has bangs you can sweep to the side. If you already have bangs, you can style them to the side to match Erza’s style. If you go to a stylist, it is good to take a picture for this look, too.If you don’t want to cut your hair into bangs, but you aren’t wearing a wig, you can buy clip in bangs to give your hair the finishing touch.

, If your hair is wavy or curly, grab a heat protectant spray and your flat iron. First, spray your hair with the spray, then carefully straighten your hair.


To add some extra style to the look, give your hair a shiny, healthy look.
Erza has very straight hair, so to make the cosplay look right, this part is important.

Get two pairs of leggings.,
Get a dark-magenta top.,
Get a pair of long, black gloves.,
Get some cool shades.,
Get a wig.,
Think about shoes.",How to Cosplay As Garnet from Steven Universe1," Garnet has two-toned pants in the pilot; you can create this effect by replacing the right leg of a black pair of leggings with a leg from a dark gray pair. If you're not into sewing, you could simply cut off the right leg on the black leggings and wear them over the gray ones.;
, Garnet's shirt in the pilot is a little elaborate, but you can start off by buying or making a magenta crop top and wearing a black tank top underneath, since Garnet's pants actually cover her entire waist.


Sewing will probably be necessary to create the semi-star pattern near the top of her shirt. A dark purple arch goes on the outside, with a stripe of the shirt's color within and a pink triangle at the center.
A strip of golden ribbon and a matching star pin should go on top of the shirt.
Styrofoam or something similar might be necessary to recreate the shape of her sleeves.

, You'll need to cut the gloves up a bit, too: they end at the wrist, save for a strip of fabric that goes up and covers the middle finger, leaving most of the hand exposed.


However, you could also leave the palm of the gloves intact to attach gems to. This is possibly the only safe way to include Garnet's gems in this cosplay.

, Any shades will do fine, but Garnet's specifically are very angular, basically consisting of two overlapping triangles. They have a dark magenta tint and are dark enough to conceal her eyes.

, Garnet's hair in the pilot is shoulder-length, with blunt bangs over her forehead.

, Garnet's outfit is basically a jumpsuit, so she doesn't technically wear shoes. Jumpsuits like this are rather hard to come by, though, so you'll be best off wearing black boots.

Find a sleeveless white blouse.,
Wear a short, bright blue skirt.,
Create a Fairy Tail sign on your arm.,
Wear tall black boots without heels.,
Add accessories.",How to Cosplay As Erza Scarlet2," You’ll have to work with what you can find, but a blouse with front ruffles is perfect for the look. Feel free to choose a shirt that is nice and tight. To keep the costume cheap, you can shop at thrift stores to find a good shirt.


As an added flourish, you can tie a thick blue ribbon under the collar of your shirt. Tie a nice bow in the front.
You may want to leave the top one or two buttons open to give your look Erza’s sexy appeal.

, Choose a skirt that has no designs on it. You can go with a royal blue or a darker blue if that’s what you can find. For the best result, choose a skirt that is ruffled. The skirt should not be too short or too long. Just above your knees is a good length for the skirt., If you have a friend who is decent at painting, have them paint a light blue design on your arm. You can also order a temporary tattoo online. Either option will only last a few days and can be easily washed off., Choose a pair of boots that go fairly far up your calf. The tighter the boots are, the better. Boots that don’t have designs or too many buckles are the ideal option.


For added sharpness, shine the boots up nicely with black shoe polish. This will help hit on the sparkly aspect that manga tends to have.

, If you are familiar with the character, you can choose a number of great Erza accessories. Carrying a fake sword will give your cosplay a hint of the warrior side that Erza is known for. Since she is often seen eating strawberry cake with a fork, a great prop would be having a plate of cake with you.

Wear brown contacts.,
Apply smoothing cream.,
Put concealer over your eyebrows to cover them.,
Contour your nose so it appears smaller.,
Apply mascara and curl your lashes.",How to Cosplay As Erza Scarlet3," Big shiny eyes are one part that will pull the costume together. If you have brown eyes already, you probably don’t need to wear contacts. Even so, contacts can make your eyes appear larger and shinier, which is great for the look.If you don’t want to spend the money or go to the hassle of contacts, your cosplay can still look great even without brown eyes. Don’t stress too much about that part.

, Anime characters have clear and blemish free skin, but most people don’t. Use some pale concealer, liquid foundation, or beauty balm to cover your face in an even, smooth coat. Applying powder on top of that will help set everything.

, You probably won’t dye your eyebrows even if you dye your hair, and Erza has very thin, straight eyebrows. If you want to pluck them into shape, you can, but otherwise covering them with concealer will help.


Then you can mix red and black eyeshadow to draw nice straight eyebrows.
This is another aspect of the costume that is not absolutely vital, but it will create a more thorough Erza look.

, You can’t change your nose to fit the thin, long look that Erza has, but you can use makeup to affect the way your nose looks. This is a fairly advanced makeup technique, so it may take some time.You don’t need to have fancy, expensive makeup, but you may need to practice for a while to get the look just right.

, Long, full lashes are the perfect finish for your Erza look. Use a brush that is for lengthening lashes and don’t be afraid to apply 2 coats for a thick look. You can also curl them before you apply mascara if you want to.

Your hair must be blonde.,
Wear pink and dress up for any and every occasion.,
Get a cute toy dog, preferably a chihuahua (like Elle's).,
Stay on a healthy diet and exercise regimen.,
Wear make-up.","How to Cosplay As Elle in ""Legally Blonde""1"," Dye your hair warm blonde or sport a wig. The higher quality of your dye or wig, the more convincing your cosplay as Elle will be. Curl the ends of your hair softly to achieve that feminine sweetness. Change your hairstyle frequently.;
, Even if you're going to the grocery store, deck yourself out. You can layer on some accessories such as celebrity-inspired sunglasses or diva-esque jewelry. This is the chance for you to strut your stuff.


If you wear another color, make sure it matches with the pink in your outfit. You can wear a fabulous pink pantsuit or a tailored pink blazer to look professional yet chic.

, Dress the dog in pink to match your outfit!


You may be tempted to set your dog on a vegetarian diet, as Elle does, but under no circumstances should you do this. The verdict is still out on whether dogs are omnivores or carnivores, and there haven't been enough conclusive studies on whether or not a vegetarian diet is good for dogs. It's best to just feed your dog normal dog food and avoid the possible consequences of deviating from a vet-approved diet.

, Keep in mind that Elle is a vegetarian. She's also very physically fit, so it's a good idea to exercise regularly. Sign up for gym membership if you haven't.

, Never let anyone catch you unpolished when you're Elle. Make sure your make-up is enhancing you and your outfit. Do not overdo it. Look classy and fresh with natural eyeliner, a bit of eyeshadow, and some lipgloss or lipstick. You want to look groomed, not like you're a member of the cabaret.

If you'd like to, include some other items of Finn's, such as the Enchiridion or a wad of Princess Bubblegum's hair!,
Talk like him!,
Finally, go out and have some adventures!

",How to Cosplay As Finn from Adventure Time (TV Show)," You can't be Finn without the hat! You can either sew one yourself (there are patterns on the internet), or you can buy one off the internet (this is way more expensive).;
, It shouldn't have writing on it if possible! Finn always wears this. If it is really cold where you live, you can wear a pull-over yellow sweater over your blue tee, as Finn does this sometimes when in the Ice Kingdom.

, If you go with jean shorts, they should not be too short! All pants should probably be darker blue then your t-shirt.

, This may look slightly dorky, but it's what Finn wears!

, You can either buy just a plain green one, or you can sew yourself a two-toned replica just like Finn wears. Finn never goes anywhere without his trusty backpack!

,, You can always find a wooden sword and paint it gold, or you can find a foam sword at Walmart, Target, or even a craft store.

, Watch the show for more examples.

, Say stuff like mathematical and beatbox!

Get two pairs of leggings.,
Get a pair of long, black gloves.,
Get the shades.,
Think about shoes.",How to Cosplay As Garnet from Steven Universe2," Garnet has huge, cubical hair - a difficult thing to pull off in real life. You'd be best going with a very large black wig.

, You might have to sew on the two star layers (bright pink outer, light pink center), but you could potentially find a good top online. As for her sleeves, it's okay to have normal sleeves and not large, cubic ones. Puffed sleeves may get you closer, and styrofoam may get you even closer. Note that the left sleeve is dark red and matches the right side of her pants, while the right sleeve is the same pink as the outer layer of her star.

, Garnet's original design has asymmetrical two-toned pants; you can create this effect by replacing the right leg of a black pair of leggings with a leg from a dark red pair. If you're not into sewing, you could simply cut off the right leg on the black leggings and wear them over the red.

, You'll need to cut the gloves up a bit, too: they end at the wrist, save for a strip of fabric that goes up and covers the middle finger, leaving most of the hand exposed.


However, you could also leave the palm of the gloves intact to attach gems to. This is possibly the only safe way to include Garnet's gems in this cosplay.

, In this design, Garnet's shades appear to be a pinkish-white, most likely due to their reflectivity. Most darker shades, however, will suit the purpose.

, Garnet's outfit is basically a jumpsuit, so she doesn't technically wear shoes. Jumpsuits like this are rather hard to come by, though, so you'll be best off wearing black boots.

Get a wig.,
Prepare to sew.,

Get the shades.",How to Cosplay As Garnet from Steven Universe3," Garnet's hair post-Jailbreak is a bit smaller than it was before. A large wig will still do the job, though.

, Sewing will be pretty much unavoidable with this version of Garnet. Buying a cosplay online might be your best bet if you can't sew and really want to cosplay this version.

, Cut them both exactly down the middle and sew them together as one, with blue on the right and purple on the left. If you can, use the remaining fabric to sew the bottom half of Garnet's shirt; that way you won't have to worry about matching colors.

, You'll need a pale pink or dark blue top as a base, then hot pink and red to create the star, which is at the lower left of the chest. The sleeves could be recreated with styrofoam.

, Garnet has deep purple gloves, which stop at the wrist save for her third finger. Get a cheap pair of long gloves and cut them out in this pattern.

, Shoes could be a bit of a challenge. You might want to buy shoes specifically for this cosplay or get subtly colored shoes that blend in with the leggings.

, As always, Garnet has a great pair of shades in this incarnation. They cover her whole forehead along with her eyes and appear to have a pink and blue tint, but normal sunglasses are good nonetheless.

Complete the lingerie look.",How to Cosplay As Dita Von Teese," This step is optional as you don't need to be a certain size or shape to look elegant and classy. Dita focuses on feeling good about herself and her clothing line even goes up to size 22. She said in an interview for Vogue that she found some of her dresses looked better on more voluptuous ladies. Therefore you should never starve yourself or make yourself miserable trying to lose weight! Although you should always try to keep healthy. Dita does yoga everyday and exercise regularly. She also drinks a lot of water. These are things that not only good for your health but also help keep your skin in good condition. Different types of teas are also very good for you especially green tea. Just remember that no matter what you look like you can always be as glamorous as Dita.;
, Dita was born with a classic, platinum blonde hair look, but after dying it black, it has become the major part of her look; aside from her outfits. You don’t have to dye your hair if you don’t want to, though it would help a lot. If you don’t want to dye your hair black, try another dark colour such as chocolate/darker brown. You also get semi-permanent dies that fade out of your hair after about 15 washes. but always read the small print on the back of the box to make sure it's what you're looking for. Learn how to perfect the curls Dita always sports: not ringlets or frizz, but big, roller curls. You can create these with actual rollers, or very carefully with a regular straightener/hair curler: remember, large, loose curls. Or you can go for the slightly different look, which is a smoother, slightly straighter style, with only the ends of the hair curled. Dita usually pins on side of her hair back and has the other side framing her face, though sometimes she pushes both sides back. It’s up to you; remember not to be a little unique. Once you have curled and styled your hair, consider accessories. Some typical Dita accessories include:


Large fake flowers. Dita puts these on the side of her hair that she pins back.
Hair clips: large, bright coloured hair clips to pin hair back. You can also use ribbons.

, Dita’s makeup is flawlessly elegant, but it can be a little tricky to recreate the look yourself. Start with your skin: take care of it and try to avoid breakouts or pimples by maintaining a daily routine of cleansing and moisturizing. Dita’s skin is usually pale, but there is an art to this: try not to look like a clown. Gently, gently dust white powder over your face, remembering to apply it to the other parts of your skin that are exposed so you don’t look like you’re wearing a mask. It shouldn't be obvious at all: simply an elegant pallor. However, this isn’t completely essential, as Dita doesn’t always do this. You can simply leave your skin as it is, or use subtle powder to accomplish a smoother look.

, Pluck them to keep them in good shape. Use eyebrow pencils to fill them in and eyebrow gels are particularly good for creating shape. Any brand will do and you can look at Dita's range by Art Deco for guidance as to what she uses.

, Use a black pencil to softly, subtly line your bottom lash line, then line the upper lid on the lash line a little more heavily. You can give yourself “Cat eyes” by drawing a curve/arch that follows your upper eyeliner. Make it as thick or thin as you want, though remember that less is more, and elegance/class is the key.

, You can try a full on, cherry red stick, or a slightly darker tone, depending on your skin colour. You may also want to use lip liner to make your lips appear fuller, and lip gloss to give them a sheen. If you don’t want to wear lipstick, just wear clear gloss. Maintain your lips with balm or chap stick, because if they’re usually dry and cracked, lipstick won’t hide it easily. Make sure that you check for lipstick on your teeth!

, Dita doesn’t wear lingerie 24/7 – she also has her own unique, everyday wardrobe. Plunge into the world of vintage. Dita says she was fascinated by the 1940’s cinema and retro fashions from a young age, and would often play dress up. Stay away from the boring mainstream trends and revive the old styles. Dita wears a lot of vintage dresses with ruffles and lace, in all lengths – long gowns, knee length or mini dresses. Buy some formal wear and then replenish your everyday wardrobe. Try plain light colours, like pale pinks/rose, or brighter colours like blues and greens, or elegant black and white. Prints like polka dots and flowers are also very stylish, although plain is fine. Good dress styles are strapless mini dresses, or those with a wrap around the waist. You can also try skirts and blouses of the same kind. Try looking at online shopping sites. Dita has the Lapel dress from Glamour Bunny Clothing which retails at just £57 ($89USD) http://www.glamourbunny.com - Another good starting place would be http://www.unique-vintage.com/.

, Big, colourful or black/white ribbons to put in your hair or on your shirt are perfect, as are ribbons. Try to wear heels that go with your outfit, for formal occasions. If you’re just looking for everyday footwear, try ballet flats.

, Of course, Dita is famous for the beautiful lingerie she models/performs and is seen in. She is fond of elaborate lingerie, such as corsets and Basques and fully fashioned, sleek stockings. The world of lingerie can be a little complicated, especially when you’re trying to pull of Dita’s flawless look. To make it easier, remember the following essentials:


Corsets and/or Basques. These are both of the same type of lingerie, and can easily help you pull of the sexy but still classy look. Shop around for things that are comfortable and not difficult to wear. It’s important not to go too far and end up looking too gothic: although there’s nothing wrong with that style, it is not Dita’s. Try plain corsets, or ones with ruffles, frills and lace. Only buy things which flatter your shape, and are comfortable, or you’ll end up looking and feeling foolish.
Stockings. Stay away from wrinkly work tights. Sleek, sheen, fully fashioned stockings are the ones to look for. Try to get stockings that come up to your thighs, or even just your knees, as these look a lot sexier when teamed up with the ultimate lingerie. Experiment with colours. Black is an essential and the safest option: you can also try fishnets, but be very careful that you don’t look sleazy. They often look best with skirts/dresses that go to or below the knees. You can also try colours that match your lingerie. Be careful to take care of the stockings, buy quality ones and not let them rip or create ladders.
Garters. These look elegant and sexy at the same time, and are perfectly at home in the world of burlesque fashion. Garters can be fixed around the waist or legs and help hold up thigh/knee length stockings. Black, again, is a must and a good option, though again you can try other colours.

, Shop around and look for lingerie/underwear that completes the burlesque look – simple, classy things, such as lace, frills or silk. The colours are up to you and your style, though some colours that Dita commonly wears are black, red, pale white/pearl, and sometimes green, purple and pink. She also is occasionally seen in leopard prints, or others. Experiment and find something that suits/flatters you and makes you feel good.

Find reference pictures.,
After you've found some pictures, start with the hardest components of the outfit.,
Cloud's shoulder armor sits sort of outward on his left shoulder.,
Underneath this armor is a flattened leather neck guard that attaches to the bottom of Cloud's armor.,
Cloud wears a turtleneck sweater with no sleeves.,
His trademark, his long spiky blond hair, is fairly difficult to style unless you use a ton of gel and a blowdryer.,
His gloves are easy.,
His pants are also easy.,
Another difficult yet awesome aspect of Cloud, is the Buster Sword.",How to Cosplay As Cloud Strife," If you've seen my Squall cosplay article, this will follow a similar format. Pictures are vital to getting every part of Cloud's clothing.;
, We'll start with his shoulder piece. This can be made from a huge variety of materials. The easiest to use is probably cardboard. Some other materials and techniques are much more difficult to come by.

, It has a distinct rounded shape, with three large bolts sticking out. Start with a shell shape. It has a rim on the part that makes contact with your shoulder. This should be flat and attached to the shell. For the bolts, look for gigantic screws. This is probably the closest you can get. If you can't find any, try making them.

, I was able to bolt the finished shell with three screws into a cardboard piece covered in suede leather. This flat piece should fit over your neck muscle and be rectangular. To keep it on your body, find a strap of some kind and attach it by sewing, duct tape(though this will be noticeable), or glue. Have this come down your chest towards your right hip then loop onto your back which will be connected to the armor and neck guard.

, This can be any color, but go for dark blue, dark purple, or black for the best results. Also, there is a second leather strap that goes right over his right shoulder and connects to a large belt-like piece. To make this, find a large piece of cardboard, cover it with leather, glue it on, then use the pictures or make any design you want on this waist piece you've just made.

, I ordered a wig online, but if you prefer, wait until your hair grows out, then cut it and style it like Cloud's. Dye it blond using temporary stuff or professional hair dye. If you don't mind wearing one, get a wig.

, Find brown or black work gloves and create a small metal ring with bolts for your right hand. For your left arm, you need two large metal rings with bolts on them. And find bandages which are worn under these gauntlets.

, They need to be baggy, and wear work boots or combat boots. Tuck the bottom of each pant leg into the boots to give it that baggier effect. These must be dark in color, and should match the sweater.

, In reality, a sword that large would be too bulky and too heavy to just stroll around with. But, if you are a true die-hard Cloud fanatic, I would go for a wooden version. Wood can be polished and made to look like metal fairly easily. The handle is similar to a pole. The hilt is rectangular, and the sword itself is a rectangle that tapers off into a triangle at the edge. Again, pictures will help immensely. Limit your sword's size to something you can actually carry!

Imagine yourself as a legendary figure.,
There are notable risks in taking this lifestyle as it is very possible you may end up a down-and-out, rather like Jack Sparrow in the beginning of The Curse of the Black Pearl.,
Always think ahead.,
Be persuasive.,
Never give away what side you're on.,
Talk like an Englishman.,
Flirt.,
Walk in a slightly unbalanced manner.",How to Cosplay As Captain Jack Sparrow," The best way to consider yourself a legendary figure is to put yourself in situations where it is appropriate to behave in such a manner. This may sound absurd and the sort of situation nobody gets into in real life, but consider this: In the modern world there are people who lead exciting lives comparable to Jack Sparrow's. These modern adventurers are different from the domestic tourist. These modern day beatniks travel from port-to-port, town-to-town living on whatever they can get their hands on.;
, The best way to avoid ending up like this is to start with a good sum of money and to use it conservatively. If possible, trade for a profit before moving on. In smaller countries, where people have little money and can't afford replacements, if you've got skills in mending broken pots or pans you could do it for these people at a small, reasonable, price. If you stick with your Jack Sparrow lifestyle you will have countless tales of heroism to impress your friends.

, If you're planning on getting to another place and somebody wants your help, think of how you could get that person to help you in the future. A good way of doing this is considering who they associate with. How can these people benefit you? Consider their worth and plan ahead based on that.

, When getting someone to help you, explain your problem in a complex manner to make yourself sound more reliable! Flicking through a thesaurus every now and again can help you to achieve this if you don't have a particularly large vocabulary.

, Just use the fact that nobody is sure as a way of getting what you want. This can become especially useful in normal life. However you should probably know (but not let anyone else know) where your loyalties lie, or at least know who your enemies are.

, Talk like an old fashioned Englishman to improve your accent. Also, talk with slightly slurred speech.

, The more girls you can have, the better! Orlando Bloom and Jack Sparrow are known for their infamous flirting!

, Use the vigorous gesticulating of the hands.

To find a local chapter in your area, go to the SCA's website sca.org, and find your local group. Contacting the appropriate person is one of the best ways to become part of the Society.


Adult members over age 18 can train and become authorized ""Heavy List"" fighters. Both men and women are welcome to participate.
Younger participants (ages 6-17) can do ""Youth Combat"" which are essentially ""boffer weapons"" based. There is very light armor. One cannot be a knight as a minor. Also, you will need parental permission and perhaps also have a parent or guardian on-site as well. Fighting in Youth Combat will, however, give you the fundamentals in SCA-style combat and prepare you for working on your knighthood.
All activities--including combat--are open to individuals of any gender. You also do not have to look like (or be) of any European ancestry. There are fighters that have physical disabilities as well.;
, The SCA is sometimes called ""the Society"" by members, reflecting the fact that this is not just a forum to beat people up in Middle Ages clothing. There are customs, laws, traditions, and ways of doing things. You will also be a part of a community, which requires getting to know your fellow SCAdians.


Events and fighter practices are the best places to find heavy list fighters and let them know you are interested.
You will also get to know what else the SCA offers besides combat. Although the Heavy List fighting is one of the highest profile activities, there is so much more going on.
You can also get a sense of other people's ""personas""--that is, what they represent historically. You will need one, too. (This is not discussed much here, but is a requirement for the SCA).

, In most local SCA groups, there will be a regular fighter practice with several participants. Loaner armor is usually available within your local group. Or a member may be happy to have you get up in his or her armor for training sessions. This is usually quite sufficient in the initial stages of training. However, this armor is likely not to fit you well enough to go into actual combat. It also may not be complete or not quite fit your needs in assorted ways. You will need to get your own armor.

, As mentioned, you will need your own set of armor. As a beginner you will almost certainly need guidance making armor that fits a strict set of regulations, is comfortable, and safe. Among the fighters in your area there are usually people who are happy to share their skills.


Helmets are typically bought, either new or used. These require the most skill, and even those with welding and metalwork experience are not advised to try this without guidance. A poor fitting or poorly made helmet is dangerous.
Armor can be made from a variety of materials, and can be made relatively inexpensive from recycled materials. Popular materials include: plastic, metal, leather, chain mail.
You will need genital protection. Men use an athletic cup. Women typically use a ""plate"" or ""saucer"" such as ice hockey female protection.
You will also need things that are not quite armor but are needed, including: gambeson (tunic under the armor--typically very smelly and stained), some sort of leather gloves or armored gauntlets, armor cap, and armor bag.
Armoring is not a required skill of the SCA fighter, but inevitably each combatant learns to construct, maintain, and repair common armor issues.

, One common training tool is the ""pell"", which is basically a dummy fighter to practice weapons on. Pells are generally variations on some sort of post with padding around it to protect your weapon from excessive damage. Pell practice helps focus on shots, build strength, and practice even if you have no one to fight with. Fighters of all skill levels use pells to practice on.


A tree can also be used. But be sure to wrap it with padding or the tree could be killed.
Pell practice does not require armor to use.
If you have a proper SCA-type weapon, use it for pell practice. It is important to get a sense of your weapon's nature, including weight, reach, balance, reaction to impact, and so on.
If you do not, a length of closet pole, broomstick, or similar will allow for practicing blows although it is not as good as having a practice weapon.

, Similar to the issues for armor is obtaining legal SCA weaponry: get help in preparing weaponry to SCA specifications. Also, to some degree the weapon needs to fit you; what works well with one fighter may not for another.


SCA Heavy List fighting weaponry is based on rattan, a cousin of bamboo. It is safer than wood and has properties that simulate steel weapons quite well.
However, lengths of rattan is not typically available off the shelf in retail stores! Typically SCA people obtain rattan from merchants at events. Buying on-line is possible but shipping is often expensive and fighters like to check the quality, balance and so forth and not ""site unseen"".

, This is a test and system that makes sure you are at a level of knowledge, skill, and ability that you are ready to participate in SCA combat. This process usually takes several weeks to a year, depending on your background and abilities. You will receive a card that lists what forms you are qualified to do, and you will need this for fighting events.


You need qualified ""Marshals"" (something like a referee) to endorse your Qualification. Your instructor's say so is not enough.
Official SCA events (such as a tournament) are typically the only place you can get Qualified.
You must do a Qualification for every weapon form; it is not a blanket endorsement.
Your gear that you qualify in must be legal, which means you probably need your own armor. Loaner armor rarely will be adequate.

, Once you are qualified, you are free to participate in fighting activities. There are a lot of them, in many different forms and challenges. Get to know the different Knights, Masters, and those that are excellent in teaching fighting skills. These are the people who will help you on your way.

, Although technically not required, becoming a Squire is the traditional and most efficient route in the Society to becoming a Knight. He or she will be akin to a sensei in martial arts--a teacher, mentor, and very often this becomes a close personal relationship. This is not a decision taken lightly. Usually you will need to fight for several years before a Knight will accept you as a Squire. Getting squired is an achievement; it marks you as someone who is actively training to be a Knight


Squires wear red belts to proclaim their status. Knights wear white belts..
Knights are individuals, and vary greatly in fighting styles, personal philosophy, and how they go about training squires. There is no standardized methodology.

, Becoming a Squire does not change everything -- you will continue to fight at events just as before. In fact, perhaps more as you will need to go to a lot of events attended by Royalty and other Knights to get attention. That red belt often will make your more high-profile...for better or worse. You may find yourself more targeted in melee, for instance. Other Knights, fighters, and Peers (others of equal rank to Knights) will likely take more notice and interest in your affairs.


Before being elevated to Knight, you will be expected to be proficient in all major weapons forms (Generally considered Sword & Shield, Spear, Pole Arm, and Two Sword) even if you are strongest in just one.
You will need to consistently demonstrate you are the equal of other Knights in fighting.
You will need to show honor and courtesy. This means showing respect to others, following the laws of the group, and being a decent and upright man or woman on or off the field. Angering too many people (especially highly influential people) may disqualify you from these honors.
You will need to show generosity or ""hospitality"". You need to be known as a person to help with your skills and knowledge. You will need to volunteer at events, help other fighters, and otherwise go beyond just fighting.
You need to look the part, too. At this level, you will be expected to have gear that reflects well on you. This means that you are making a noticeable attempt at good clothing, developed a decent persona, armor, and the like. You do not have to be a fashion model or absolutely perfect gear -- but you need to look like you care about your appearance and presentation.
Be more than a ""stick jock"". Knights are expected to also show interest in things other than hitting people. Or making things to hit people. This could be practicing music, dancing, cooking for feasts, learning Old Norse, and more. It sounds difficult--on top of all that training and weekend events you are expected to do more? But at this point you have been in the SCA and have been exposed to all sorts of interests. Usually you will find something that you can explore.

, In the SCA, only a Knight can make another Knight. Different Kingdoms handle how people are chosen to be elevated to the level of Knight in slightly different ways. But this decision is not one taken lightly, and usually involves literally on a ""Watch List"" that is kept by the King and advised on by other Knights. Typically a name is on such a List for years.


A special ceremony is held for those about to be nominated for Knighthood. It involves being called into the Court, being sent to a vigil, and returning to continue the ceremony.
If a person wins a Crown Tournament without having a Knighthood, the Knighthood is bestowed immediately. The King (or Queen if by her own hand) must be a Knight. This is rare but has happened in the SCA on several occasions.
A Knight must also be agreed-to by a majority of other Peers (those equal in rank, but not for fighting ability). Respect for arts, service, and other aspects of the Society is very important. Do not treat non-combatants as second-class citizens.

, It's tough to move quick in all that armor, so do what you have to.

",How to Make a Paper Cup Hat1," The holes will be for the string or elastic to go through. This way, you can secure the hat to your head. The holes need to be opposite each other. You can punch them using a hole puncher or a thick needle.;
, You can attach the hat in two ways: an elastic strap or by tying two pieces of ribbon in a bow under your chin. Here is what you need to do depending on which you choose:


Cut a piece of elastic and thread each end through each hole. Tie the ends of the elastic in place. The elastic needs to be tight enough to hold the hat to your head, but not so tight that it feels uncomfortable.
Cut two14-inch (35.56 centimeters) long pieces of ribbon or string. Thread the end of each string through a hole, and tie it in place.You will tie the loose ends of the ribbon in a bow under your chin when you wear the hat.

, You can use craft foam or poster paper for this as well, but avoid using plain paper or construction paper; it will be too flimsy.


Keep the brim proportionate to the hat. 5½ to 6 inches (13.97 to 15.24 centimeters) will be plenty. If you are making a pilgrim hat, then the brim can be even smaller.
If you are making a pilgrim hat, choose black paper for the brim.

, Place the cup upside down in the center of the brim you traced. Use a pencil to trace around the cup, then lift the cup away.

, Cut the outer circle first, then the inner circle.

, If you look at your paper cup, you'll notice that the rim is rolled under itself. Draw a thin line of glue right under that rim. The glue should be in the seam just between the cup and the rolled rim., Turn the cup upside down so that the bottom is facing you. Push the paper brim you cut out over the bottom of the cup, down the sides, and onto the glue. The cup's rolled rim will hold the paper brim in place and keep it from sliding down.Some of the elastic or ribbon that you threaded through earlier may show. Don't worry, you can cover it up with the hat band in the next few steps!

, If you'd like, you can decorate the hat with glitter, other painted designs, or even stickers. Be sure to let your designs dry before moving on.


If you are making a pilgrim hat, paint the hat black.

, This will make the band part of the hat. It is not completely necessary, but it will make your hat look nicer. If you are making a pilgrim hat, great colors to use would be white or brown. The strip needs to be wide enough to wrap around the base of your hat.If you are making just a regular hat, the strip can be any color you want.

, Draw a squiggle of glue along the band, then carefully wrap it around the base of your hat. For a pilgrim look, position it ¼ in (0.64 centimeters) above the brim.If you are using craft foam, the band may come apart before the glue dries. Use a piece of tape to hold the craft foam together until it dries.

, Cut out a 1 by 1-inch (2.54 by 2.54 centimeters) square out of yellow craft foam, construction paper, or cardstock. Cut a ½ to ¾-inch (1.27 to 1.91 centimeters) square out of the center. Glue it over the band, right in the center of the hat.,"

It should have the things Lara has like, a small medical pack, a torch, night flares, a drink (Lucozade or water), a snack (something small but filling that can be put in a container) and other things like your artifacts and relics.

, Make sure you get plenty of exercise and good food. An exercise plan should be made to keep you fit and well. Keep a good workout plan with stretching, muscle building exercises, low intense cardio and high intense cardio. Make sure to put away a lot of time to exercise. Only eat when you are hungry or you could put on too much weight. Include plenty of protein in your diet and if your really committed cut out all junk foods. Follow the food pyramid.

, This will keep you fit, add to your exercise, keep you ready for anything and will help you get a great body.

, Always be out looking for an adventure. But be smart about what you are doing. Don't swim in shark infested waters unless you are trained in how to handle sharks. Don't go trough dangerous places until you know where you are and don't get caught up with dangerous people like Lara really does. Live life with a little danger, but don't risk it all.

, Make sure you have high stamina and strong legs to run with. Getting to ultimate fitness takes two to three years of training! So don't push yourself too hard when starting.

, Do crunches, push-ups, pulls-ups, chin-ups and weightlifting to get toned. Arm muscle is important for fighting and climbing. Abs are good for climbing too. Females don't get more muscle than men but that doesn't mean you can't get muscle.

, Have your standard outfit. Then your winter outfit, your water outfit, your deep-sea outfit, your stealth outfit and other outfits that you will need on your adventures. All of your outfits should come with boots and your backpack. Sometimes clothes are hard to find. Internet is a good choice of browsing. Amazon, eBay and other websites are good to get your costumes. Also you can get leather off the internet to make your gun belt or bag.

, This will help you escape and catch someone as well as getting around places quickly. Parkour is an art. Its difficult to learn and is dangerous too so always be careful and don't push yourself too hard.

, Benches, walls, things that might get in your way.

, Never show fear even in scary places. If you every feel scared, a good way to get rid of it is to take a deep breath and think of where you are and change it around a bit in your mind to make it a place you want to be. It could be as simple as making the room brighter. If you scream at the sight of a spider web than being adventurous Lara Croft is certainly not for you.

, If you can't afford classes get a friend who knows martial art to teach you. Martial arts is more than just a style of fighting, it's a discipline as well. Its almost a form of meditation. Never make fun of it.

, One of the most important things is smarts. You can't get stuck in front of a rock with old writing on it, not knowing what to do. Reading, learning, listening all builds up intelligent an wisdom. Lara knows many languages and for her adventures she knows an extreme amount of history and geography. She is also clever. If your stuck on anything in your adventures, remember to think outside the box.

, Lara's bio says She is fluent in a dozen languages. But around five languages will do. Maybe more. Learn a few old languages like Latin, Celtic, Egyptian etc. if you can.

, One of Lara's defining traits is her English heritage. Try not to sound too stereotypical and make sure to get the right variant of English. England has many different accents depending on where you're born. Lara is an aristocrat so she has received pronunciation or informally called posh. Avoid saying things like ""cor blimey"" or ""governor"" as it's an obvious stereotype. Don't refer to yourself as British; only Americans refer to English people as British. The term is incorrect since British involves Scotland, Wales, England and several smaller islands. The term also annoys most English people and will give you away as fake.

, You can wear the hat in two ways: with an elastic strap under your chin, or by tying two pieces of ribbon under your chin. Here is what you need to do depending on the method you choose:


Cut a piece of elastic and poke each end through each hole. Secure the ends with tight knots.
Cut two pieces of 14-inch (35.56 centimeters) long ribbon. Thread the end of each ribbon through each hole, and tie it in place.

, You will be gluing some tinsel to the hat, so keep this in mind. A glossy black is classic, but you can also paint the hat with glue, then cover it with glitter for something even more blingy.

, Since this will be a wacky party hat, you can go a step further, and decorate it some more. Add some glittery, sparkly stickers. If you painted the hat a solid color, you can draw designs on it using glitter glue.


This can make a great New Years hat. Consider sticking some number stickers onto the front of the hat to honor the new year!

, The tinsel should be wide enough to wrap around the rim of the cup. The fluffier the tinsel, the better!

, Draw a line of glue around the cup's rim, then press the tinsel down onto it. Consider working 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) at a time so that the glue doesn't harden too fast., The tinsel makes it perfect for parties, such as New Years.

Consider trimming the rolled rim of your cup off first. This way, you won't get a bulky seam where the hat and top join.

, Draw a line of hot glue around the top rim of the cup, then quickly push the circle down onto it. For a neater touch, draw the glue just inside the rim; this way, you won't have to worry about the glue leaking out from under the circle.


If you'd like a fancier hat, cover both the cup and the circle with fabric first. You can use any type of fabric you like, but stretchy fabric will make it easier. Tuck any raw edges inside the cup or under the circle.

, Most paper cups are too tall to be a top hat, even a stylized, mini, ""Mad Hatter's"" top hat. To make it more realistic, cut the bottom portion of the cup off. For example, if you are using a 12-ounce (350 milliliters) cup, an 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) off the bottom will be plenty.For a more authentic look, cut the bottom of the cup at a curve on both sides so that it dips slightly towards the front and back.

, You can use a compass or a plate to do this. Keep the brim proportionate to the cup. A 5½ to 6 inches (13.97 to 15.24 centimeters) will work great for a 12-ounce (350 milliliters) cup., If you'd like, you can cut the center of the brim out too; this will help the hat sit better on your head. Use the bottom of your hat (the cut part of the cup) to trace the circle, then cut it out just a little bit smaller; this will make it easier to glue the hat together. For a fancier hat, you can cover the brim with fabric as well.

, Draw a line of hot glue around the base of the hat, then quickly press the brim down onto it. If you cut the base of the cup at a curve, make sure that the brim follows the curve; you don't want any gaps. Hold the brim in place until the glue sets; this should only take a few seconds.

, This will blend everything together, and make it look more like a hat, and less like a combination of paper cups and cardstock. You can use acrylic paint or spray paint. Let the hat dry before continuing.


If you covered your hat with fabric, then you do not need to paint it.

, Secure the band with some fabric glue. Measure around the base of the hat, just above the brim, then add ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters). Cut a piece of ribbon to that length, then wrap it around the base of the hat. Overlap the ends, and secure them with glue.


For a for finished look, tuck the raw edge of the ribbon under before you glue it down.
For a fancier gothic hat, cut a long, narrow strip of tulle or spiderweb lace, and wrap it around the base of the hat. Tie the tulle/lace in a bow or knot.

, A Mad Hatter's top hat is not complete without any added decorations. You can hot glue all sorts of odd things to the hat band. To keep your hat from looking too wild, keep all your decorations to one spot, preferably on the side. Here are some ideas to get you started:


Mini feathers
Fancy beads
Fancy coat buttons
Old watch gears
Hat pins

, For a more chic look, glue the hat at a slight angle on the headband; this way, it will rest on your head at an angle instead of right on top."

Measure your waist to determine the width of your skirt.,
Tie each piece of raffia or ribbon to your waistband string one at a time by using Larks head knots.,
Tie the skirt around your waist.",How to Make a Hula Skirt1," You'll need raffia or ribbon (2-4 large packages), scissors, a measuring tape, and a sturdy string, such as yarn or twine. You'll also need a sink or bowl to soak your raffia / ribbon in, and a flat surface where you can lay the raffia / ribbon out to dry.


If you want an extremely dense hula skirt (one that you cannot see through), you'll probably need about 4 large packages of raffia or ribbon. If you want a lighter skirt, 2 large packages should be enough.
All of these supplies can be purchased online or at your local craft store.;
, Start by unrolling your raffia 







, As you remove your raffia or ribbon from the water, lay it on top of a towel on a flat surface to dry. It will take a few hours to dry, and should feel completely dry to the touch before you begin attaching it to your skirt., While the raffia / ribbon is drying, take your measuring tape and measure the length from your waist to your knees (or however long you want your hula skirt to be). Write down this measurement so you don't forget it., Find the measurement you wrote down in the last step, then double this number and add 2 inches. For example, if you want the skirt to be 15 inches long, cut your raffia 







, Take your measuring tape and wrap it around your waist to see how long you need to cut your string. Then, take that measurement and add 12 inches. This added length will be used to tie and untie your skirt. This string will be your waistband.








For example, if your waist is 30 inches, cut your string so that it is 42 inches long.

, Look here for visual instructions on tying Larkshead knots.









To tie a larks head knot, start by taking a piece of raffia or ribbon and folding it in half.
Take the looped end of your folded raffia or ribbon and slide it under your waistband string. The looped end should be below the waistband, and the loose ends should be above the waistband.
Now, take the loose ends of your raffia or ribbon and fold them towards you, around your waistband string.
Slip the ends through the loop and pull tightly to secure your raffia / ribbon to the waistband.Do this with each piece of raffia or ribbon until your hula skirt is complete. It should take 2-3 entire packages. Leave 6 inches on each end of your waistband string so you can tie and untie your skirt.

, Use a bow instead of a knot so that you'll be able to tie and untie your skirt. Have fun in your new hula skirt!

Gather all of your materials.,
Cut your paper bag.,
Lay your paper bag out on a flat surface so that it is horizontal / landscape.,
Draw the waistband onto your bag.,
Cut strips into your bag to create the fringe part of your skirt.,
Cut your string.,
Tape or staple your string onto your skirt.,
Put the skirt on!",How to Make a Hula Skirt2," You'll need grocery bags (typically 1-2, depending on how big your waist is), a pair of scissors, a pencil, a thick string (such as yarn or twine), and either packing tape or a stapler. Having a ruler will also help, but isn't absolutely necessary., Start by cutting along one of the corner seams of the bag all the way to the bottom. Then, cut off the entire bottom of the bag by cutting around the perimeter of the bottom. Your bag should now be in a long rectangle shape.








If you are going to use more than one bag, repeat this step with each bag.
To see how many bags you need to use, wrap one horizontally around your waist. If it goes all the way around you, you only need to use one. If the bag leaves more than a couple inches showing, you'll need to add an additional bag.
You won't always need to use entire bags. For example, it might take a bag and a half of a bag to fit around your waist. It's just paper, so you can cut and tape the exact amount of paper bag that you need.

, If there are any words or logos on the bag, leave them facing upwards. The upward facing side of the bag will end up being the inside of your hula skirt. This way, the words or logos won't show when you're wearing your skirt.

, Drawing an outline for your waistband will show you where to stop cutting when you're making the fringe of your skirt. Take your ruler and measure 1-2 inches down from the top of the bag (depending on how thick you want your waistband to be), and make a small mark with a pencil. Then, place your ruler horizontally on the mark (your ruler should be parallel to the bag), and trace a straight line across the entire top of your bag. This line will mark off the waistband of your hula skirt.







, Starting on the right end of your bag, cut strips into your bag by starting at the bottom and cutting upwards until you reach the waistband outline. Strips should be 1








Repeat this with any additional bags you are using.
Leave the bag(s) laying flat while you do the next step.

, Wrap the string around your waist to see how much you'll need. Be sure to include a few extra inches of string on each side for you to tie and untie your hula skirt. Then, cut the string. After the string is cut, lay it along the waistband portion of the skirt that was not cut. Center the string to leave a few inches on each end of your skirt to tie and untie it.








If you are using multiple bags, lay the bags side by side and tape or staple the end of the waistbands together. You will lay the string along the top of the entire width of your skirt.

, Be sure that the string is secured well to your skirt, otherwise your skirt will not stay on.









Use a heavy-duty tape, like packing tape or masking tape. Tape the string down along the entire waistband.
If using staples, it's best to add a staple every 2 inches.

, Pick the skirt up and tie it onto your body. Use a bow so that it is easy to tie and untie your skirt. The tape or staples should be on the inside of your skirt, so that they cannot be seen from the outside."

Draw out your antler shape in pencil on paper or cardboard.,
Cut out your antlers.,
Create your headband.,
Paint the cardboard antlers and headband.,
Connect your headband.,
Attach your antlers to the headband.",How to Make Reindeer Antlers1," You’ll want to use a strong paper, like cardstock, or a lightweight cardboard.


If you don’t want to go out and buy paper or cardboard, you can use a deconstructed cereal box or the cover of an old composition notebook, as these are an ideal weight.
If you’re uncomfortable drawing antlers freehand, find a free template online to print out and use as a stencil.Make sure the sections of your design are wide enough that they will be easy to cut. Your design just needs to represent an antler shape. It doesn’t have to be completely accurate to nature.
You want the antlers to be tall enough that they sit high above the head, but you don’t want them to be so large that they flop over. About 12” high is ideal, but feel free to customize and experiment.
You can use identical antler shapes for both antlers. You’ll just make sure that you glue on onto your headband facing the opposite direction of the other. Only draw one of the antlers.;
, Make sure to stay close to your lines. Cut slowly and carefully.


After you cut your first antler, use it as a template for the second. Place it on your paper or cardboard and trace around the edges.
Cut out the second antler.

, You’ll need more paper or cardboard to create this band. It doesn’t have to be exactly the same as the material you used for your antlers.


Wrap the edge of your paper or cardboard around the middle of your forehead until it reaches all the way around. Hold with your finger the place where the edges meet, and then mark this with a pencil on the paper. Mark again about another inch out from your first mark because you’ll want some overlap to attach the band.
With this measurement, cut a band from your material. It should be about 2 inches wide, but you can make it wider if you want more space to decorate.

, Brown is a typical color for antlers, but you can choose other colors you like more.


Use acrylic or craft paint. This gives a solid color and dries fairly quickly.When you paint your headband, only paint to the line you drew marking where the end should attach based on your head size. You want to leave a little unpainted space at the end of the band so you know where to attach it.
After the paint dries, you can add fancy touches to your creation with accessories like glitter glue, sequins, stickers, or pom-poms.

, After the paint dries, you’ll want to create your headband from the strip of paper or cardboard you cut out for it.


Use staples, glue, or tape, to fasten it together. Use your line as a guide for where to fasten it together. If you use glue, let the glue dry before you move on. Use a clothespin to hold the pieces together while the glue dries.
Try it on. Put on your headband to make sure it fits comfortably and slides far enough onto your head but isn’t too loose.

, You should connect the bottom of your antler pieces just slightly above the bottom of your headband.


Again, you can use staples, glue, or tape.
If you use staples, place a small piece of duct tape across the staple on the inside of the headband so it doesn’t scrape the wearer.
If you use glue, let it dry before wearing. Try placing the headband antler side down on a table and put small heavy objects, like paperweights, on top of the ends of the antlers to help them adhere as they dry.

Gather your supplies.,
Ready your work area and tools.,
Add flowing sleeves to the tank top.,
Make a vest if you desire.,
Attach accents to the costume top.",How to Make a Genie Costume1," You should be able to find any supplies you lack at local general retailers or craft stores. If you're making a costume on a budget, you may want to see if you can purchase some of these supplies from a secondhand store or thrift shop. All things considered, you'll need:


Decorations (like fake jewels, rhinestones, glitter, etc.; optional)
Empty toilet paper roll (for ponytail holder; optional)
Gold dot stickers (optional)
Gold sequin fabric
Hot glue gun (and glue)
Leggings (billowy ones recommended)
Scissors
Sheer fabric (any color)
T-shirt (plain recommended, any color)
Tank top
White tulle fabric (or sheer white fabric);
, You'll be hot gluing parts of your costume together. To prevent hot glue from making a mess, you may want to lay some newspaper or an old table cloth on your work surface. Take your hot glue and insert a stick of glue into it. Then plug in the gun to warm the glue.


A silicone mat works great as a cover for your work surface, but cardboard, parchment paper, or even tin foil are cost efficient substitutes.
If this is your first time using your hot glue gun, its tip may start smoking slightly. This is normal.
If your gun continues to smoke, or smokes excessively, unplug it immediately and keep it from flammable surfaces until it is cool.
Your hot glue gun's model and make will influence how long it takes for the gun to warm. Generally, you can expect this to take two to five minutes., Take your glue gun and apply glue to one of the straps of the tank top. Then, attach your tulle fabric to the tank top strap with the glue to form billowy sleeves for the top of your genie costume. Do this for the other sleeve as well. Be careful when doing so. Hot glue can burn you if it gets on your skin.


You can adjust your tulle fabric by cutting it with scissors to form different shaped sleeves.
You can make simple sleeves by attaching the tulle to the tank top in such a way that the tulle forms a cylinder shape through which an arm can fit.
Be sure you work quickly when attaching parts of your costume with hot glue. Hot glue hardens quickly., A vest isn't necessary for this costume, but many depictions of genies have vests. To make a vest, use your scissors to cut the sleeves off your plain t-shirt and a slit up the middle of the front of the shirt., This can give your vest a little extra glamour. Add your golden circle stickers to the fabric, placing them at regular intervals around the hem of your vest, up and down its middle cut, and around the arms.


At this point, you can also decorate the top of your costume with other accents, like rhinestones, beads, or fake gems. Use hot glue to attach each accent where you want."

Find the right silhouette.,
Choose your dress style.,
Choose your footwear.,
Create a flapper-era face.,
Style your hair.,
Or buy a wig.,
Choose a headband.,
Choose a hat or head piece.,
Roll your stockings.,
Choose your neck wear.,
Add the finishing touches.",How to Make a Flapper Costume," The classic flapper look is all about the dress--specifically the shift dress.


The flapper-dress silhouette is a dress that features a drop waist (the waistline was often dropped to the hips), straight vertical lines that hang loosely around the body, a scooped neckline that reveals the neck and shoulders, minimal or no sleeves, and a hemline falling just at or above the knees (a scandalously short length for the time).;
, The two classic flapper-dress options are a fringed dress and a beaded shift dress.


Though fringe is perhaps most readily associated with flapper fashion, Egyptian-inspired designs and embellishments were also quite popular at the time (inspired by the recent discovery of King Tutankhamen’s tomb), so keep an eye out for dresses and fabrics with a slight Egyptian feel.If you opt for the classic fringe dress, your easiest option is to buy one ready-to-wear in a vintage color--typically black, white, gold, or silver.
If you prefer to craft your own dress and are handy at sewing, you can begin with a solid-colored dress that matches the flapper silhouette. If you plan to make an entirely fringe-covered dress, buy several yards of fringe (you’ll need anywhere from 6-9 yards, depending on your size and your margin of error) and sew them in consecutive horizontal rows over the length of the dress.
If you prefer just a trim of fringe along the bottom, buy a yard or so of fringe and attach it just around the hem of your dress.
For even more details on making your own flapper dress, see How to Make a Flapper Dress.

, The 1920s saw a major increase in the profile of footwear, since, given the rising hemlines, shoes were a particularly visible part of the flapper outfit.


The most popular shoes of the flapper era featured a heel of at least two inches, in either an ankle-strap Mary-Jane or T-strap style, sometimes adorned with sequins or beads.
Flapper fashion was oriented around dancing, so choose shoes that are danceable with covered toes and chunky heels--no stilettos!
You might opt for flats if you absolutely can’t deal with heels, but they may not look quite as authentic.

, Flapper makeup is quite distinct and features long thin brows, lots of black kohl eyeliner, dark eyeshadow, and deep red, bow-shaped lips.


To get the brow look, aim for long, relatively thin, and straight brows. If you don’t want to pluck your eyebrows into the flapper shape, you can use a brow pencil to draw them in.Use dark eye shadow and eyeliner to create a smoky look. Use black, smudged eyeliner on both the top and bottom lids and create a dark, smokey eye with dark-colored eyeshadow. For details on creating a smokey eye, see How to Get Smokey Eyes.
Use a soft pink blush right across the apples of your cheeks.
Use a deep red matte lipstick for lips.Try to emphasize the heart shape of your lips by lining your cupid’s bow and filling out your bottom lip with lip liner., The true hallmark of flapper style is the bob--a short, cropped haircut that was radically unconventional for its time.If you don’t have short hair or can’t emulate it, curls are the watchword of flapper style, so style your hair in pin curls or soft waves. See How to Create Pin Curls or How to Style Finger Waves for more detailed instructions.


If you already have short or bobbed hair, you can style it like a true flapper by creating waves that lay close to the head using hot rollers or a curling iron.
If you don’t have short hair, you can fake a bob by fashioning your hair in a chignon (a low bun) or a rolled ponytail (pull hair in a low ponytail and tuck and pin the ponytail under, optionally securing/disguising the tucked pony with a headband or ribbon tied around your head). Or you can just wear a hat or skullcap (see Part Three) and not worry about hair at all.

, If you really want to embrace the flapper look but don’t have hair amenable to the classic flapper bob, look for a bobbed wig.


If you want to emulate Clara Bow, the iconic actress who embodied the flapper style on screen, look for a short, black-haired wig.
If you want to pay tribute to the great style diva of the 20s, Coco Chanel, look for a short wavy wig in a dark brown color.
If your inspiration is the great silent-film actress Mary Pickford, look for a short wavy-haired wig in a light brown or dark blonde color.

, Beaded, sequined, or pearl headbands are a classic choice and are perfect for slight subtlety and understated elegance. Flappers typically wore their headbands running across their forehead and down across their hair.Your simplest option is to fashion a simple beaded headband from a string of beads. Buy a string of beads long enough to fit around your head and fasten the two ends together with either hot glue, a hair tie, or some elastic. You can then opt to add a feather clip to the headband for additional vintage flair.
Another option for a simple headband is to buy a sequined headband or buy a solid-colored headband and glue sequins to it.
You can customize a slightly more elaborate headband by buying a length of elastic (the thinner, the better) about 1/2 the circumference of your head, pearl beads in your size of choice (just make sure to buy enough to go around the circumference of your head). Then string the beads around the length of elastic and then tie to ends together.

, If you prefer more of a statement piece than a headband, opt for one of the classic flapper head coverings--a cloche hat, a cloth turban, or a beaded skullcap.


The hat most associated with flapper fashion is the cloche, a bell-shaped hat (“cloche” is bell in French) that fits closely to the head. You can find cloche hats at many online retailers as well as at many costume shops.Many flappers would adorn their cloche hats with beads, flowers, feathers, or embroidery, so don’t be afraid to accessorize your hat a bit.
Another popular choice for headwear was the fabric turban. You can buy a ready-to-wear turban or select a length of cloth and tie your own. Tying your own turban is relatively straightforward and can be accomplished in a few steps.Flappers would also opt for close-fitting beaded skull caps, which can make an excellent choice if you don’t want to be bothered with the hairstyle, since they’ll completely cover your hair.Though skull caps are fairly difficult to make, you can buy them from many online costume and craft retailers.

, One of the big (and controversial) innovations of flapper fashion was the rolled stocking.Rather than wear “modest” stockings, flappers would wear short stockings (closer to today’s knee-highs) rolled up to just below the knee.
The most important feature of the look was the roll left at the top of the stocking. By not fully unrolling their stockings, flappers created an appearance of their stockings being half-on--or half-off.
The most popular color for stockings was a flesh-tone (black was considered conservative), though patterned and pastel-colored stockings also fit the flapper aesthetic. You have the option of opting for fishnets as well.
Finally, remember that in the 20s, stockings still had seams, so if you want to enhance the accuracy of your hosiery, choose seamed stockings or draw a seam along the back with an eyebrow pencil.

, Whether it includes scarves or long necklaces, the classic flapper look rarely ignored neck adornments.


Opt for a single long necklace or several long necklaces of varied lengths. When flappers wore jewelry, it was almost exclusively long beaded necklaces, sometimes double-stranded.
Or choose a scarf or boa. Fringe and feathers are of course the epitome of flapper style, so add a fringed scarf or feathered boa to your outfit for a little extra style. A scarf or boa is particularly ideal if you don’t have a long pearl or beaded necklace.
If choosing a scarf, look for a long, thin one, ideally with fringe, to keep true to the flapper look.

, There are some final signature accessories that will really set your flapper style apart.


Put on some elbow-length gloves. Though many flappers enjoyed the the completely bare-armed look, elbow-length gloves were a good option for evening parties, and adding some to your costume can give you a touch of sophistication.
You may need to look online specifically for elbow-length gloves, or you may be able to find a pair at a costume retailer.
Carry a flask. If you want to truly embody the rebellious spirit of the flapper, carry a flask and show your disdain for Prohibition.
A popular--and cheeky--way for flappers to carry their flasks was to secure it to their leg with a garter belt.

, Cut a 2-inch (5.08 cm) wide strip of fabric (thin felt is best) that measures the distance around the person's face or the dog's neck plus 2 inches (5.08 cm) long. This fabric will look best if it is green. Next, crease the fabric by folding in half lengthwise and then pressing along the fold with an iron to make a sharp crease.

, Draw petals on the white or yellow felt. Make the petals 3-inches (7.62 cm) wide at the bottom and have them taper to a point at the top. The length of the petals is up to you. You may want to make each petal measure as long as the person's face.


Make enough petals to go all the way around the fabric strip on the daisy or sunflower costume. Leave 2 inches (5.08 cm) on one side for the hook and loop closure.

, Cut out each petal, and fold each petal in half lengthwise. Press with the iron to make a crease.

, Stretch the strip of fabric out on your work surface. The folded, creased side should face toward you. Now, fold the bottom .5 inch (1.27 cm) of each flower petal under, and place the petals in a row in the center of the fabric strip, nesting the creases. The pointed tip of the petals should point away from you.

, Thread a hand sewing needle with an 18-inch (45.72 cm) length of matching thread. Tie a knot in 1 end of the thread. Push the needle through the backside of the strip of fabric, up through the folded portion of the first petal. Don't pull the needle and thread through the main body of the petal as you want it to stick out when the flower costume is worn. Hand sew all the petals on in this way, attaching the folded portion of each petal to the fabric strip using a running stitch.


Try to use longer lengths of thread but break the sewing up into sections if you have to.

, Cut a 2-inch (5.08 cm) long strip of velcro. Separate the rough and the fuzzy sides and then pin the rough side of the velcro to the top side of the fabric strip, at the point where there are 2 inches of extra fabric. Then, pin the fuzzy side of the velcro to the underside of the fabric strip, on the opposite side, under a petal. Hand sew the velcro in place.

, Wrap the petal headband around the person's face or around the dog's neck. You may need to slide bobby pins under the fabric strip to hold it in place, if it is worn around the face. If the petals won't stand straight, you can glue white plastic straws on the back side to make them stand up.

, Draw the shape of a leaf onto some large pieces of green felt. Instead of leaving a vertical strip for the stem, make an attached horizontal strip instead. This will be used to make a cuff for attaching to the arm.

, Cut out the pattern that you made. You may also want to paint some veins onto the leaf or add other touches, like a painted or plush ladybug.

, You'll need to cut out a square of velcro and glue or sew it onto the cuff. Make sure it is at a size that it fits where you want it to go. Around the elbow is best.

, Make one or two for each arm and put them on when you're done.

, This should be a large, planter type pot (wider at its base than your hips). It should also be made out of plastic, instead of terra cotta or similar materials.

, You'll need to use a utility knife or melting technique to cut the entire bottom out of the pot. Then, you'll also want to punch four equally spaced holes in the side of the pot, underneath the lip.

, Make some shoulder straps using lengths of bungee or paracord, with hooks on the end. You can also use thick twine, if you need more adjustable length. You can paint these straps green if you want to.

, Tie the straps onto the flower pot at the holes you made in the sides.

, Put the pot on your body, resting the straps on your shoulders to hold the pot up.

, You can add some finishing touches, like having a stuffed worm hanging out of the top, or gluing craft grass around the inside of the lip.

Pick a headband.,
Choose the wire for your antlers.,
Decide how thick you want your antlers.,
Cut your wire.,
Sketch a shape.,
Form the shape of the antlers.,
Twist the base of the wire antlers around your headband.,
Cover the headband and antlers with brown yarn, tissue paper, or brown tape.",How to Make Reindeer Antlers2," For these antlers, you’ll want to use a cheap plastic or metal headband. You can find these at most large departments stores or the dollar store.


The thinner your headband is, the easier it will be to attach your wire antlers, and you’ll use less wire. Choose a headband around one-half of an inch wide.

, You can find wire in craft stores in the jewelry making section and in hardware stores. For this project, you’ll want a fine gauge wire.


The larger the number of a wire’s gauge, the smaller the wire is.For this project, you can use 18-24 gauge wire.
If you want to utilize what you have on hand, you can use wire coat hangers. These are harder to bend than thinner wire, but with pliers, you can shape them.

, If you want a thicker base, use more wires when you begin to form your antler shape. If you want a thinner antler, only use two to four wires wrapped around each other.


A good number is about 6 wires per antler. If you’re using coat hangers, consider only using around 3, as they are more work to bend.

, Once you decide how many wires you want to include in each antler, enough pieces from your wire for both of your antlers.


Each piece should be about 1.5 feet in length. This will help you end up with a proportionate set of antlers.

, Before you begin to work with your wire, it can help to freehand sketch the shape and number of branches you want in your antlers. You can also find a premade template online or use a picture as your guide.

, Remember to consult your guide. Depending on the gauge of your wire, you may be able to use a combination of pliers and your hands to bend and shape.


Wrap the wires around each other, twisting upward. Periodically, pull one or two of the wires off to the side to form a branch.
Play around with them until you get shapes that you like.

,


Position the antlers so that they look natural and even. Hold the headband up to your head in a mirror so you can see if you like the placement.
Wrap all the wires completely around the headband at least twice, and then make sure that the antlers are sitting firmly in place.

, This will make your antlers look more realistic. You can use hot glue or a paper mâché technique.


If you want to use yarn, do a small section at a time so the hot glue doesn’t dry before you get to it. Put a small amount of hot glue onto the wire, and begin to wrap the yarn around the glue and press down. Be careful not to burn your hands. You can also use super glue.
If you want to use paper mâché, first make a glue solution. Use white craft glue, and add just enough water to make it slightly runny. Rip up strips of thin brown paper. Dip them in your glue solution and then shape them around your antlers. Layer them until you achieve desired thickness. Let your antlers dry.
As a simpler alternative, you can use brown washi tape or duct tape, and simply wrap it around your antler shapes until you make it as thick as you want. You can even use plain masking tape and paint it afterwards.

Gather your materials.,
Begin to form your antlers.,
Wrap the ends of this headband around a plastic or metal headband.",How to Make Reindeer Antlers3," You’ll need two pipe cleaners per antler and a cheap plain plastic or metal headband.


For this project, larger pipe cleaners work best.
Brown is a typical color for your antlers, but you can use any color you would like.

, One of your antlers will stay straight, and you won’t bend it at all. This will be the middle “stalk” of your antler.


Lay this stalk pipe cleaner vertically in front of you. Lay the other pipe cleaner perpendicular to the stalk pipe cleaner about a quarter of the way down from the top of the stalk piece.
Attach this pipe cleaner by twisting it around the stalk twice to keep it firmly in place.
Pull up the two ends of the pipe cleaner toward the top of the stalk piece to make a fork-like “V” shape.
Cut off any excess ends to make the “V” pipe cleaner look proportional to the stalk pipe cleaner.

, Wrap tightly to make sure your antlers stay in place.


Because the pipe cleaners easily slide around a headband, it is best to add a dot of hot glue or super glue where you’ve connected the pipe cleaner to the headband to keep it in place.
When you wear your head band, feel free to bend your antlers and adjust them to improve the look.

Pick something tasty for your antlers.,
Connect the antlers.,
Decorate your headband.",How to Make Reindeer Antlers4," Though you won’t actually be eating them, you want them to look good enough to eat and festive.


Use three candy canes turned outward in the opposite direction from each other for each antler. These work well because you can leave on the plastic wrappers, and they won’t get sticky.
Try breaking up pieces of large pretzels to form the branches of your antlers. Pretzels are a more realistic looking way to make whimsical edible antlers.

, Hot glue works best for this. Simply lay out your antler design on a plate and dot hot glue where you want to connect your pieces.


After you glue your antlers together, glue them to a plastic headband. A thicker headband works best. Be generous with the hot glue as this will be the only support.

, For more embellishment, you can use hot glue or super glue to add other edible decorations to your headband.


Line the headband with round peppermints.
Gumdrops also hold up well as decorations.

Cut your gold sequin fabric.,
Hot glue your gold sequin waistband to the leggings.,
Add accents, if desired.",How to Make a Genie Costume2," This will form a decorative waistband that you'll attach to the leggings with hot glue. You can cut any pattern you desire into the sequin fabric, like wavy lines or straight lines, for example.


You'll need the gold sequin fabric to be long enough to fit around the waistband of your leggings., Lay the leggings out flat on your work surface with the front side facing up. Apply a line of hot glue to the waistband of the leggings. Then:


Quickly press the front of your cut, gold sequin decorative waistband into place on top of it. Take care not to burn yourself on hot glue.
Repeat this process on the reverse side of the leggings so that your gold sequin waistband wraps all the way around and is on top of the waistband of the leggings., If you find your pants to be a little plain, you can accent them in the same way you did to the top of the costume. You could use more circular, gold dot stickers, perhaps up and down the side of each leg.


You might also want to use your glue to attach other decorations, like fake gemstones and more.

Collect your costume making materials.,
Cut the vest of your costume.,
Decorate the vest.,
Add special features to the jumper and enjoy.",How to Make a Genie Costume3," The character of Genie from Aladdin is relatively simple. To imitate Genie's classic blue skin tone, you're going to use blue cloth. If you want exposed parts of the body blue as well, use a blue body paint. You'll need:


Dot stickers (gold colored)
Jumper (blue)
Long sleeved shirt (blue)
Paper (optional; gold colored, durable kind, like card stock, preferred)
Scarf (red; sheer cloth preferred)
Scissors
Tape (gold colored), Take your blue shirt and use your scissors to cut off its bottom half. Then use your scissors to cut a straight slit at the middle-front of the shirt collar that extends to the bottom hem. This should allow the shirt to open at the middle, like a vest.


By leaving the long sleeves of the shirt attached, it will look as though you have blue arms, just like Genie., Outline the vest portion of your long sleeved vest with a line of golden dot stickers. These will attached just to to the inside of the shirt collar, bottom hem, center slit, and shirt sides. This will add contrast to your costume, and make imitate Genie's blue and gold theme.


You can add unique designs of your own to the long sleeved vest. For example, you might add yellow up-and-down stripes to the vest using your golden tape.

, The jumper will cover most of your body in blue fabric, making it look like your skin is blue. Add left and right lines to the jumper just below the waist and at the cuff of each pant leg. These will imitate the golden bands that Genie wears.


You can also add golden dot stickers to your jumper to make it more flashy and rich in appearance. For example, you might do an up-and-down line of stickers up each pant leg between your golden taped portions.
Using a jumper is especially recommended for small children. Playing in a costume without a shirt could make children more susceptible to sickness.If you plan on using body paint to color your upper body, you may want to forgo the jumper and instead buy billowy blue pants, like harem pants.
You could also make golden wrist cuffs by cutting a strip of durable gold colored paper into a strip and taping this around your wrists."

Make a simple headpiece.,
Fashion an I Dream of Jeannie ponytail holder.,
Use a simple topknot or a high ponytail for boys.,
Include a lamp and other suitable accessories.",How to Make a Genie Costume4," If you desire a headpiece, like a fancy headband, you can make this from your gold sequin fabric. Cut a length of gold sequin fabric with your scissors that is long enough to fit around your forehead. Then:


Fasten the loose ends of the gold sequin fabric into a circle by gluing them together with your hot glue., Cut an empty, clean toilet paper roll in half with your scissors. Then take sheer fabric (you may want to tulle fabric again, here) and cut it into a 2"" by 5' (5 cm by 1.5 m) strip. Wind it around the cardboard of the tube so the fabric covers the cardboard completely but does not obstruct the gap in the center of the roll. Then:


Use your hot glue to fasten the ends of your fabric to the toilet paper roll. Excess fabric can be tucked underneath the wound fabric and glued.
Cut another piece of the same fabric 2' wide by 3' long ( .61 m by .91 m) and fold it roughly into a triangle so the triangle's base forms the longest side.
Hot glue a corner of the long end of your fabric on the inside of the toilet paper roll. Repeat this with the opposite corner on the inside of the roll opposite where you glued the first one.
Slide hair into the ponytail holder using a high ponytail, and drape the fabric hanging from the inside of the tube down the sides of the head so it rests on the chest., Boys may not want a headpiece or ponytail holder. In this case you can simply gather their hair into a simple ponytail, much like Genie in Aladdin.


If you really want to authentically imitate Genie from Aladdin, you could shave your head, leaving only enough hair for a ponytail behind.

, You may be able to find suitable genie accessories, like a lamp, wrist and ankle cuffs, necklaces, earrings, and so on at a thrift, second hand store, or dollar store. Add these to your costume to make it look more authentic, and enjoy your genie costume.As a substitute for a lamp, you might spray paint an old and unused teapot gold. For younger children, you may want to use a durable teapot, like one made out of plastic."

Wash and dry your skin before you begin.,
Smear black eye pencil around your entire eye socket, including your eyelid.,

Add dark blue or dark maroon eyeshadow to the inner corner of the eye and along the eyelid.,
Finish by blending in yellow or light green.",How to Make a Fake Black Eye," Otherwise, you can irritate it. What's more, you want to work with a clean palette.;
, Give special emphasis to the area below your eye, nearest your nose. Smudge the eye pencil with a tissue wrapped around your finger for a smoother look. Be sure to let the edges of the ""bruise"" fade realistically.


Highlight immediately beneath your eye and the line that forms a crescent shape underneath your eye. These two areas get very puffy and inflamed when hit.

, Highlight the edge of the nose that got hit (near the corner of the eye) and just below the eye, where the last knuckle would land.


A cream-based shadow may be more effective, but matte powder will work, too.

, Use a stipple sponge, if you have it, to mimic a scrape. Concentrate the red on the corner of the eye near the tear duct and at the top of the cheekbone near the outer edge of the eye.

, Dab the brush on your hand before applying to make sure you're not accidentally concentrating too much product on any one area.

, Add these colors at the outer corner of your eye, your orbital bone, and the lower edge of the ""bruise"". When a bruise fades, it turns more to this end of the color spectrum.

Let the glue dry and dress your baby.",How to Make a Popcorn Baby Costume," Use a measuring tape, to measure out a piece of white felt that can cover the front of your baby carrier. Alternatively, you can drape a large piece of felt over the front of your baby carrier and mark off the appropriate amount of felt needed to cover its entirety with a pen or marker.


Leave extra felt so that the felt can wrap around the front of your baby carrier.;
, Cut small triangles out of the top of the felt. Each cut should only be a 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) long. The idea is to make the top of the costume appear like the top of the popcorn bag. Once you're done, the top of the felt rectangle should look spiky.

, Go into a word processor or graphics program and print out the words POPCORN. Using a bold or blocky font will make cutting out the letters easier.

, Try to make the straightest cuts possible when cutting out the letters. Remember to cut out the centers of the p, o, and r.

, Tape will hold your letters in position and allow you to cut straighter lines when cutting the felt.Apply clear tape over the corner of each letter. Test the tape on a small area of felt before using it. Some highly-adhesive tapes will ruin cheaper felts, so make sure to use a tape that isn't very adhesive.


If you find your felt coming apart, switch to scotch tape.

, Use sharp scissors to cut through the felt. Sewing scissors are the most adept at cutting through the felt and leaving clean and straight cuts. Do not hack away as you are cutting.


You can also use an Exacto knife on a flat desk to get cleaner cuts.
Some of the best brands of sewing scissors include, Fiskar, Gingher, and Kai., Discard the letters and tape because you won't need them anymore. Once you do this, you should have clean, felt letters that read POPCORN.

, Use a hot glue gun to apply your felt letters onto a larger piece of white felt. Arrange them according to how you want them to appear on the front of your baby carrier. The white felt needs to be big enough to fit all of your letters. If you don't have a hot glue gun, you can purchase one at most craft, hobby, and sewing shops.


You can use regular glue as an alternative for hot glue, but it will take much longer to dry. You'll also have to wait for it to dry in between each step.
Glue guns typically cost anywhere from $11 - $53 depending on the model., Cutting out the white felt behind your letters will give them depth. In addition to the added aesthetic benefit, it will also make it easier to secure them to the popcorn bag, and help prevent them from falling off of your child's costume.

, Cut 2 to 3 inch thick strips that are as long as the large white piece of felt that you cut out earlier. To test if they are the right size, you can lay them over your white piece of felt. As you continue to cut additional strips, put them equally far apart from each other so you know when you have enough.

, Glue the red strips over your large white piece of felt. Your costume should now look somewhat like a bag of popcorn from the theater. Lay the strips down as flat as possible and run your hand over them once they are glued to get out any wrinkles.

, Take the letters that read POPCORN and use the hot glue gun to attach them to the front of your baby's costume. Because you've created the white and red outline, the words should pop.

, Drape the costume over the baby carrier and wrap it around the bottom and sides. Find an area on the side of the carrier where you can attach safety pins to a piece of cloth or fabric.

, You can also use an old beanie or sock hat that you already have for your baby, but keep in mind that you'll probably have to dispose of it afterward. The best colors to use are yellow or white because they will blend in with the popcorn.

, Cut small squares of felt so that you can secure the popcorn to the hat. The size of the small squares don't need to be exact but must be large enough to fit a single piece of popcorn.

, Attach your popped popcorn to the small pieces of felt that you cut out. If you don't have a hot glue gun, you can use Elmer's glue or a glue stick.

, Glue on your pieces of popcorn. The top of the baby's hat should look like the top of a bag of popcorn from the movies. If you run out of popcorn, cut out more pieces of felt until the entire top of the hat is covered.

, Before you put the popcorn hat on your baby, you should make sure that the glue is totally dried. You don't want it to come off, and you want to allow it time to cool down if you used a hot glue gun. A great benefit of this costume is that your baby doesn't need to be dressed in any uncomfortable clothing.

Decide what battlefield or Civil War site you want to visit.,
After selecting what site you want to visit, Google the top web sites associated with that battle to learn more.,
Make a 'favorites list' of web resources you find.,
Learn your Civil War Battle ""ABCs"" before you go.,
Determine your game-plan for your site-visit.,
Make smart travel plans.",How to Prepare to Visit a Civil War Battlefield or Site,"


Start with a site that is close to you. If you live on the East side of the Mississippi River, there's a pretty good chance there is a significant Civil War site or battlefield close enough to get to within a half-day's drive or less.
If you need help, visit the National Park Service web site to see a list of Civil War battlefields by States.;
,


For example, if you were interested in the Battle of Franklin (TN), Google the phrase (in quotes) ""Battle of Franklin"" and add the State designator ""Tennessee"" to the search too.
Go through the first 2-3 pages of search results and just serendipitously browse through the sites listed. Take your time. Take notes. Write down questions, ideas, etc.

,


Bookmark your favorite 3-5 web sites you can come back to later to evaluate.
Don't forget to look for blogs, Facebook Groups, Twitter accounts, government and State web sites, Google maps, You Tube videos, etc.
If a blogger of a Civil War battlefield site is in the top 10-20 of your search results, it's a pretty good bet s/he is pretty knowledgeable about that battle. Some Civil War bloggers have hundreds of pages archived on their blog, like the BattleofFranklin.net blogger does.
Local area convention and visitors bureaus (CVB) can be very helpful here (example).

,


Learn the lingo. Spend time in Wikipedia, other web sites, or even crack open a book or two, to gain a basic understanding of the vocabulary you're going to be exposed to.
Look at a Google map of the area you're going to visit, or at least examine a trustworthy map on Wikipedia or from a trustworthy site. Some bloggers have even created their own Google maps of a battlefield.
Check out a solid Civil War Timeline to better understand the major events that took place around the time of the battle you have chosen to focus on.
Check out You Tube or Netflix to see if there are any good videos or movies on your battle. Again, some bloggers post scores of You Tube videos on battlefields they are very familiar with (example).
Take advantage of photo tools like Flickr. Check out the thousands of pictures Civil War buffs have published on sites like Flickr (example).
Historical markers - all available online - are great resources to take advantage of.

,


Do you want to go alone, with someone else, a small group, or take an official tour? Guys, consider what a site or location has that will appeal to women like historic homes, gardens, etc. Some women don't care about all the 'battle detail'.
How much time do you have for your visit? A couple hours? Half a day? All day? A couple days?
Figure out your budget. What local sites will you visit at your battlefield choice that will involve spending money? Entrance fees? Museum fees? Restaurants? Lodging (if applicable)? Fun money?
Some CVBs, State web sites, etc., have online trip planners (example).
Request a 'Visitor's Guide' from a CVB or similar (example).
Look for events and activities in that community or location that might coincide with your visit dates (example).

,


Make RSVPs ahead of time for lodging, restaurants and even some historical sites. Some tours, for example, take place on the hour. Call ahead and RSVP your spot.
Learn when the 'peak season' is for a location. A novice would probably not want try to take on Gettysburg around the 4th of July since it's the peak season for the hard-core Gettysburg people. However, peak season for the Battle of Franklin is mid October to late November and this smaller venue is perfect for the novice.
Research what the weather will be like for your visit. Sounds simple enough, but nothing can ruin a small trip like lacking proper clothing for the cold or heat, and not having an umbrella if it rains.
Think through what gear you want to take to capture or enjoy your experience. Will you want your smartphone, digital camera, video camera, notebook, iPad, laptop, or GPS unit?

Alternatively, pin the tulle directly to the dress.If you want to skip the elastic bands, you can use safety pins to fix the bunches directly to the mini-dress or bodysuit.,
Fluff up the tulle.,

Spray yourself with glitter spray.,
Put gel in your hair or wear a shower cap.,
Wear shower shoes.",How to Make a Loofah Costume," Each length of tulle should be about 2.5 yards (2.3 m) (2.3 m).For a fuller loofah, you could create more bunches of tulle. Create an even number of bunches so that your costume will still be proportional.
The lengths do not need to be cut perfectly or with precise evenness. They should all be close to the same size, but by the time you finish, it will not matter if a few are shaped a little differently than others.
You could also use nylon matte netting instead of tulle.;
, Fold one piece of tulle in half lengthwise, essentially halving the width.


Repeat with the other pieces.







, Fold one piece of tulle widthwise into thirds. The length of the tulle should be one-third of what it was.


Repeat with the other pieces.






Do not worry about making exact or perfect folds.

, Pinch one piece of folded tulle in the middle and tie it in place with a small piece of 1/4-inch (0.635 cm) elastic.


You could also hold the bundle together by twisting an elastic hair band around the center.
Use your fingers to gently fluff the tulle after bundling it together.
Repeat with the remaining pieces of folded tulle.

, Wrap a soft tape measure under your arms and around the fullest part of your chest.Stand in front of a mirror or ask for help from another person to make sure that the tape measure is parallel to the ground all the way around.
Bring the tape measure together in the front to make it easier for you to read the numbers.

, Wrap a soft tape measure around the narrowest part of your torso.


The narrowest part of your torso is usually immediately above your belly button or somewhere in that area.
Make sure that the tape measure is completely parallel to the ground all the way around. To double-check this, continue standing in front of the mirror or getting help from another person.
Wrap the tape measure around your back and bring it together in the front.

, One piece should match your bust measurement and the other should match your waist measurement.


Add roughly 4 inches (10 cm) of extra length so that you can tie the elastic together.

, Tie the elastic together to form bands and trim off most of the excess on the ends.


Slip the elastic over your bust and waist to make sure that it is fits. If it is too loose or too tight, re-tie it and try again.
Knot the elastic to secure it in place.

, Attach half of the tulle bundles to the bust band and the other half to the waist band.


Space the bundles along each band at even intervals. For instance, if you have four bundles on the bust band and four on the waist band, space the bundles apart in even quarters.
Attach the bundles to the band by tying a short length of 1/4-inch (0.635-cm) elastic around the center of each bundle. Tie the other end of each elastic string to the waist or bust band.
You could also attach the bundles to the band by weaving a safety pin through the tulle and into the band.

, If possible, wear a strapless mini-dress or bodysuit in a color that matches the tulle.


If you cannot find a dress that matches the color of the tulle, wear one in white or black.
Short shorts and a tube top can also be worn instead of a solid dress or bodysuit. For a more conservative appearance, you could also wear tights or leggings.
Wear the bust band around the bust and the waist band around the waist.

,


Slide the safety pin through the tulle near its base. You may need multiple pins for each tulle bundle.
Keep the fabric of the dress or bodysuit as flat as possible as you pin it. If you gather too much fabric into the pin, you will end up causing the dress to bunch. If this happens, it may become difficult or impossible to slip the dress on.
You may need to try the dress or bodysuit on as you work to make sure that it still fits.
Make sure that there are as few empty spots as possible on the dress.
This option is preferable over the previous method if you have many small bunches of tulle. If you only have 8 to 12 bunches, either method can be used. For any more than that, however, the use of waist and bust bands is not recommended.

, Fan out the tulle with your fingers, positioning the layers of each bunch so that it covers as much area as possible.


Continue picking at and fluffing the tulle bunches until you no longer notice any empty gaps. The outfit should look as ""bunched up"" or ""fluffy"" as a shower loofah when done.

, Cut a length of white cord or rope that can fit around your neck and down to the top of the costume. Attach the rope to the top of your mini-dress, your bust band, or the top layer of tulle bunching.


Use safety pins to attach the rope. You could also attach it using a hot glue gun or a needle and thread.

, To give yourself a ""wet"" appearance, spray a coat of glitter spray over your arms and legs. Also spray some along your shoulders and neck.


If it is safe to use the spray on your face, apply a little to your face.
This part of the costume is only optional, but it will contribute to the shower-like or bath-like appearance.

, Hair gel will make your hair look wet, while a shower cap reinforces the shower theme.


If using hair gel, wet your entire hair with the gel. Cheap gel is actually preferable because it will make your hair look wetter.

, Complete the costume by wearing mesh shower slippers, plastic flip-flops, or plastic crocs.

, Nothing is more embarrassing than running around a National Park by yourself and then falling over.

, Remember, the American Civil War was fought between the Union and Confederate armies. Knights and storm troopers were not at the Battle of the Shiloh.

, Some reenactors march in columns with their units. Others run onto the battlefield waving their arms and screaming. It's your call.

, Make sure you time your falling over just after the sound of your enemy's gun. Nothing is more embarrassing than falling over to silence. You will look like the world's stupidest soldier. Also, take care not to fall over after the sound of your own side's guns, lest you look like you just got fragged.

, Spectators need to know where you've just been shot, and that it hurts. Hence the clutching.

, This area is open to the most artistic interpretation. Most people go with AAAGGGHHH! but the more elaborate death cries also build backstory into your character. For example, try ""This one's for you Aunt Be-AAAGGGHHH!"" or ""I'm coming for you Mr. Linc-AAAGGGHHH!"". Another helpful tip is to reference the side you're fighting: ""The only good Reb is a dead AAAGGGHHH!"" The most important thing to remember with the death cry is you must interrupt whatever you were going to say with AAAGGGHHH!

, If you're in the front rank, fall forward so you don't knock over the guy behind you, and if you are in the rear rank fall backwards.

, You must remain still until the battle is over. An exception to the rule is if the reenactment allows zombies (see Tips section).

Find a unit in your area that you'd be interested in joining.,

Confederate or Union (totally your preference);
Infantry is the best choice for a drummer, as they have the most need.,
Obtain the proper equipment.,
Find a drum.,
Consider drum heads.,
Find a sling.,
Obtain the sticks.,
Find additional items.,
Prepare for drumming:



Tighten your drum.,

It is recommended to read ""Bruce and Emmetts"" for Civil War re-enactors because it really does a good job of explaining everything you'll need to know.,
After you gain confidence in your drumming and with these tunes, you can start to learn other songs such as Breakfast Call, Retreat, the Troop (for Dress Parade), and many others.

,
Learn Proper Military Etiquette.,
Find someone to play with.,
Learn about a musician's duties.",How to Become a Civil War Drummer (Reenacting)," The internet is a great way of doing some research, most groups have websites now. Also, take a look around State/National Parks and historical museums; a local group might sponsor an event there, which gives you the opportunity to meet many groups and see them in action.;
, Heavy Artillery units would also have had drummers. Cavalry and Light Artillery units would not have had drummers and are not the best options. However, these units might know of Infantry units to check out;
Are they family oriented or not;
Are these people you'd like to spend several weekends with;
What types of events do they do (battle re-enactments or more educational living histories) and which do you like better?

, The unit you're joining may be able to help you by pointing you in the right direction or even having spare uniform bits lying around. What you want to get will depend on the unit that you join. From pre-1863, most musicians wore a musician's frock (a frock coat with piping all over the front), but this is only appropriate for some units. Remember, this is an expensive hobby, requiring a few hundred dollars for just a uniform and equipment, and an additional few hundred dollars for a tent and blankets.

, Some units may have their own drum that they'll let you borrow. Some of these are very old or not completely authentic. Or you might like to have one of your own. Cooperman, Florence, and Heritage are some of the names, but search around before committing to one. Drums tend to run somewhere around $350-1,000.


Drums prior to the Civil War were often much longer (18"" and more), but they were shorter in the Civil War, with 12-14"" deep and 16"" in diameter being the most common.
Drums can be made longer or shorter for taller or younger people. The maker would be the best person to ask for more information regarding proper sizes and the best size for you're height/age.
Tackwork is very common for Civil War drums, as were pictures like eagles and Confederate shields. It would actually be very uncommon to not have one or both. These tend to add an additional $50-200.

, There is also the option for different drum heads: calf skin is completely authentic but hard to manage as all weather distorts the sound. Synthetic skin looks pretty close from afar, handles weather well, and plays nicely and can be easily bought through REMO or similar companies if you need to replace it. Kevlar is more what is used by modern drums and sounds amazing but completely wrong for the period, it's also harder to get now.

, Most drum makers sell a cotton sling which is not authentic at all but cheap and passable. The thicker cotton slings that go around your neck are Civil War appropriate. Leather slings are more for Rev War and 1812, but look correct for the Civil War. You might want to use those because you might not find it easy to care a drum with a neck sling.

, Thin sticks that you'd use for a drum set won't do - they're way too small and light and won't play well against a drum head, they also make it harder to play certain rudiments (the building blocks of drumming) on these drum heads since they won't be anywhere as tight as modern drums. There are many people who make authentic sticks; Cooperman being well known for them. It can take a while to find ones you like, as each type as a different weight and feel but you will eventually. Regulation drumsticks were Rosewood, 16-17"" long. Rosewood is dense and these sticks are quite heavy (100-110 grams), but are really the best for this style of playing. Either way, heavier is best. When you order drum sticks, make sure they're at least 85 grams (3 oz).

, These aren't necessary items, but will go a long way to help you learn:


Drum pad (can find that easily on Amazon or at any drum store) allows you to practice and not annoy your family and neighbours too much.
""Bruce and Emmett's Fifer's and Drummer's Guide"" - this is a Civil War manual with self-instructions and the complete daily duties of the musician. Although commonly used, this manual is debatable not the most authentic. It is also a little more challenging to play for a new drummer. You can also check out Hart's or Howe's.
""The Bread and Butter of Jamming"" by Walt Sweet has a large collection of fife and drum tunes that are the versions most people play.

, The ropes all around the drum are there to create tension that stiffens the drum head, making it playable. Before playing on your drum, you need to pull the ears down (the leather pieces on the sides). You'll develop your own taste in the stiffness of the head, but essentially you need to pull them down far enough to make the drum playable. You should also do two at a time (the two across from each other) to lessen the strain put on the drum.
When you strap your drum up, the rim should fall somewhere around your hip and be almost on your left side. Not too far though or you'll be sticking your hands out in the middle of nowhere! Try for good posture while wearing the drum, it'll help keep your back from getting sore. And your back and shoulders will get sore until you get used to carrying it and build up muscle.
Practice walking for a while; it takes a bit of skill to keep your drum where you want (especially on different terrains and in the wind).
When you're done playing, always make sure to put the ears up. The continual strain on the head will eventually cause it to stretch, meaning you'll need to push the ears down farther every time. Also the rope will start to slacken. Your rope will stretch and tighten over time and in different weather anyway, but it's best to not force it to loosen. Eventually you'll need to ""pull"" your ropes, meaning you'll need to undo the knot and manually pull the rope tighter, like tightening your shoe laces. Instructions will probably come with your drum, or you can request information from the maker.

, Sticks were held in a traditional grip because of the way the drum falls when you wear it.


In the right hand you should almost be making a fist around the stick with your thumb pointing up towards the tip of the drumstick. But that doesn't mean your whole hand should be squeezing the stick- in fact only your thumb and forefinger should be putting pressure on the stick. The other three fingers largely provide support and can be used to speed up your sticks movements.
In your left hand, make a gun with your thumb, pointer finger, and middle finger. The butt of the stick should go in the crock between your thumb and pointer finger and then your pointer and middle finger should curl around the stick, leaving the ring and pinky finger under the stick.

The thumb should always be placed over the pointer finger, this reduces pressure points on the stick. Most people develop a feel for where they like their middle finger to fall, sometimes very close to the pointer finger and sometimes hardly touching the stick.



, The first step is to get used to hitting the drum like this: the right hand should rely on a downward motion (the wrist for most strokes and the whole arm for stronger/louder strokes); the left hand is a twisting motion (you should be able to see your palm before you hit and the back of your hand after you hit).


You should practice each hand on its own until you're comfortable (be careful with your left hand!) and then learn to alternate your sticks.
At first, most beginners are very tense and try to either press the sticks into the drum or just bang on it- neither are very good. The stick will naturally rebound (taking some of the work away from you) if you relax and hit the drum soundly.
A lot of beginners also seem timid- don't be afraid to make noise! Just don't wail on the drum needlessly.

, Once you can stand and walk with the drum, have good sticking control, and can do both at the same time, you're ready to learn more. Because this type of drumming is very old, it's also very rooted in rudiments. These are essentially the ""ABC's"" of drumming and are different kinds of sticking patterns that produce different sounds/rhythms. You can look up the 26 essential rudiments and check out ""How to Play Drum Rudiments"". Most importantly for your purposes are:


Double stroke roll,
Flams,
Paradiddles,
Flamadiddles,
Flam accents,
Flamacues,
Ruffs,
Single and double drags,
Ratamacues, and
Sextuplets.

, Double stroke rolls can be broken down into specific, short rolls: fives, sevens, nines, tens, elevens, fifteens, and seventeens being necessary to learn. Double Stroke Rolls are really important as they are a major part of this style of drumming. Basically what they are is two strokes on each hand (technically the second should be louder than the second) progressively made faster until you are making a roll (it will sound almost like a machine gun). At first, it's almost impossible to do exactly that; in fact, on the first try most people will tense up before they get very far, but an expert could technically do a full roll without or with very little bouncing.

, There is a lot of information in there, but the following are some basics of what is important in a re-enacting situation:


Assembly (777 flam flam 777 flam flam 777 flam flam 77 flam flam 7);
Drummer's Call (7 flam flam 7 flam flam 7 flam flam 2x fast, 1x slow, 7 flam 7 flam);
Simple Cadence (Open Beating) (5 5 5 flam flam, repeat);

this is played to the rhythm ""left, left, left, right, left; the 5's are the lefts and flam flam is for right left)


Reveille (it's 7 songs long, but usually only Three Camps is played);
To the Colours, which signals the men to Rally or Form by Battalion and is used as a salute to the flag.
Three Cheers- used as a fancy roll of during ceremonies like Retreat, Tattoo, and Dress Parade.
Long Roll- used as an alarm (immediate assembly under arms) and cease fire.

,,


You should stand with good posture and at attention, with drums sticks tucked under your right armpit, when not playing.
When at rest, the sticks may be lowered. During a long parade rest, the drum may be set on the ground, but the musician should remain standing. If in a corps, wait for your Drum Sergeant's command to unsling drums.
While standing in formation, do not tap aimlessly on your drum. Remain quiet until ordered to play something.
When the men are assembled for things like roll call, the musician should stand on the far right of the company. If the company joins with the rest of the battalion, the musician should fall back into the third rank (with the file closers) and stand in the middle of the right half of their company.
On the march, the drummer may be asked to march at the head of the column, in order to beat a cadence, or to stand on the right of the column a few ranks back.
The fifer or bugler is always to the right of the drummer.
Saluting with nothing in hand was done like the British- with open palms facing outward and your fingers tips at the rim of your hat. With a fife or bugle, the instrument should be perpendicular to the ground in front of your face. Drum sticks should be held in an upside down ""v"" shape in front of your face, the tips coming to rest together over the bridge of your nose.

, Part of the Civil War drumming experience is learning tunes and this becomes easier (and more fun!) if you have a fifer and/or another drummer to play along with you. Also, playing with others helps you to develop confidence in your abilities, improves your timing and dynamics, and gives you the opportunity to learn other songs.


Army 6/8, Connecticut Halftime, and Army 2/4 in ""Bread and Butter"" are the best place to start. Almost all drummers can play those and they go to just about every fife song. Songs like ""Yankee Doodle"", ""Dixie"", ""Garry Owen"", and ""The Girl I Left Behind Me"" are favourites that can be learned also.
If you have another musician in your area or group, see what they know first so you can learn those or you guys can decide together what you like. If not, just flip through a music book and pick out songs that you think you can learn or that look interesting. Keep trying to challenge yourself to learn newer and harder material.

Camp duties: The 20 or so musicians in a regiment (10 companies) formed together to play a number of daily duties, including Reveille, Retreat, and Tattoo (the three roll calls) as well as ceremonies such as Dress Parade, Funerals, and Guard Mounting. In addition, two musicians were assigned to the guard every day. Typically the fifer was assigned orderly (like a runner) to the Officer of the Day. The drummer was at the guard house where he would play police beats, such as wood and water call, Drummer's Call (to assemble the drum corps), or Assembly.
On the march. The drummers kept cadence, though likely only for portions of the march. A day's march averaged 15–20 miles (24–32 km) per day and, depending on the terrain, the men would likely alternate between route step and other steps. Drummers and buglers could also play signals to indicate certain maneuvers, like right or left wheel.
In battle: There is some debate as to what role musicians actually played during the war. In tactical manuals, drummers duties are described as playing a long roll to signal cease fire, at which the men would cease firing, load their weapons, and wait for orders. Following this, the drummer plays a tap to signal the officers to take their places in line if the line is to move. There is also music for commence firing. As skirmishing became a larger part of military tactics, drummers added Recall Detachments, to signal the skirmishers. They could also play To the Colors, to signal to rally on the Battalion, or Assembly, to signal assemble on the company or battalion. Buglers had even more signals related to skirmishing, such as lie down, rise up, deploy as skirmishers, etc. Musicians may have been used as stretcher bearers and nurses, although this is not officially recorded in an regulations or tactical manuals.
Your own research is still vital. Drum manuals, such as Bruce and Emmett's and Howe's, have a good amount of information on the order of camp duties and how to perform them. The US Regulations, 1861, revised 1863, also detail the entire ceremonies that musicians are apart of (see Reveille, Retreat, Tattoo, Roll Call; Funerals; Dress Parade; Reviews; Inspection; Guard Mounting). Tactical manuals, such as Hardee's, Gilham's, and others, mention the roll of musicians. Overall, understanding the military tactics of the day will help develop an appreciation for the importance of just the command ""cease fire"".
Most importantly, you'll need to teach your First Sergeant, as well as other NCOs and Officers, what you know and how to use it. For example, once you learn Three Cheers and a Troop, you may need to explain how to include a musician during Dress Parade. If you learn combat related calls, you may want to take time to drill with the men so that they can learn these calls and how to use them.

Get your costume together.,
Make sure that you wear a long sleeved shirt.,
Put on your wig.,
Style your wig!,
Get your jacket and put it on.,
Have some type of headphones like Aoba.,
Don't forget the glove.,
Take some photos.,
Remember it's not about having a perfect cosplay, it's about having fun.",How to Cosplay as Aoba Seragaki from Dramatical Murder," When doing this step, it's important to look at a lot of reference images to make sure you know how each piece looks. That way, you can find or make pieces that more closely resemble Aoba's outfit.;
, Even if it's not the original color of the cosplayer, you can substitute for black, or even a turquoise blue (something that will flow with the cosplay's color scheme) but for a better visual of Aoba Seragaki, you should use a black sleeved shirt.

, Make sure it has the right look. Even if your wig is in good condition, brushing always prevents future tangles, so stroke a brush of your choice over your cosplay wig a few times just to make sure and you can get short blue hair if you want because Koujaku has cut his hair, but you can get the long blue hair too, it's you're choice.

, There are many hair products available, so choose the one that suits to your needs best. It may also be helpful to ask people what brands or products they use, you can even style you're wig to look a little more gorgeous, because Aoba Seragaki's hair is already Gorgeous.


The trick to using hair gel is to rub it in your fingers like it's lotion, and apply it by twisting small bunches of hair and pulling them both outward, and downward. And voila! Just like magic your hair would look ten times better!

, After you've applied your hair product to your wig, now would be a great time to put on your jacket! make sure it's short and same as the one Aoba Seragaki has.

, Aoba Seragaki, like many other characters, has cosplay headphones. If you cannot afford, or cannot get one shipped to you in time then try going to Hot Topic, or Walmart to get a pair of plain, red headphones for under $40, Aoba Seragaki's Headphones are Pink.

, The step to cosplaying would be Aoba's glove, which is fingerless. Aoba only wears one glove and it's on his right hand.

, Now that you're in your cosplay it's a good idea to take some in character photos to show off your cosplay. You can also cosplay with your friends as the other characters from dramatic murder or go to conventions in your cosplay and you can also take pictures to remind you of the day when you have gone to the conventions as Aoba Seragaki.

, Don't be afraid to make the cosplay you wear unique and individual, just have fun!

As with any cosplay get reference pictures, front, back, sides the more you can find the better.,
Most of the best looking cosplayers use wigs for Axel so I'd recommend getting a wig and styling it yourself or commissioning one.,

, But if you don't want to go with that road. Make your hair spiky using lots of gel and hairspray. Dye it red with temporary hair dye or semi-permanent dye. Remember to keep it out of your face. For wig styling Got2Be is the best brand. For wigs the best site is amphigory.com, a good Axel wig (needs to be styled) is Punky XL black to red.

, Contacts are usually the best. You can usually get a cheap green sample pair at your eye doctor

, These are crucial.

, Use phrases structured like ""I dunno. That's kinda not what I was thinking'."" He doesn't use full words most of the time.

, or ""Commit it to memory.""

,, This is, of course, optional.

, If you want to appear bald, cover it with a rubber cap instead of shaving it off. Another option is to look up the character's hair color and hairstyle. With this research, you can buy a cosplay wig. This will make the cosplay more realistic, because the boys are not bald. However, if you are cosplaying Kyle, you could use a rubber cap because in the episode ""Ginger Cow"", Kyle shaves his hair off.

, Watch any episode of South Park to get the hang of it, and practice in front of a mirror.

"
"
First of all, decide which con you want to go to, do this at least two months in advance, this gives you time to make hotel reservations, save up spending money, and money to buy what you need for your costume, and time to put it all together.,
Your costume will look best if you make it from odds and end, look around at costume shops, and on websites that sell costumes.

,
Get some Ears.,
Get the type of top that goes with your dimensions.,
Find some bottoms to match your look.,
Skip the tops and bottoms and go for a dress.,
Own the heels!,
Accessorize: This is the fun part where you can be really adventurous!,
Wear some nice Jewelry.,
Make sure your makeup matches.,
Get your nails professionally done.,
Finish off with your hair.",How to Cosplay As a Sexy Cat Girl,";
,, These are of course, essential to any cat girl costume, try to get them to match the color you want your costume to be, if you can't find them, a simple black or white fur (faux of course) is always a safe way to go. Try to get rather large cat ears, they look so much better. Do not attempt to try to make them yourself, I've been down this road before and it only stresses you out., This can be a little tricky so read carefully. Crop tops (belly shirts) look awesome with a cat girl costume, try getting a metallic one in black, gold, or silver, but this only looks good if the top is a halter top with a metal ring holding the straps. You can also get a different crop top, animal prints are always gorgeous, also ones that look like a corset in the front are cute too. But no matter what kind of top you get make sure it is either strapless, haltered, spaghetti strapped, or long-sleeved. It looks bad if you're wearing a short- sleeve t-shirt like top.

, If you want a skirt, make sure it is the right length. Here is a way to be sure: Stand up straight, and lay your arms flat against your sides and have someone else, make a pen mark on your thigh where the tip of your middle finger is, your skirt should be no longer than that. Get a skirt that matches the color of your top, but isn't identical to your top. For example if you have a solid pink top, don't get a solid pink skirt(or bottom), try to get a white, black or brown skirt, (depending on the color of your ears and accessories), and add cute pink accents, like ribbons, or maybe have someone sew a pink ruffle on the bottom for you, or you can even take a hot glue gun, and a feather boa from the kids section at any store and hot glue it around the bottom of your skirt, I've done this before and it looks adorable. And I would recommend getting a pleated skirt, they're much cuter with a cat costume. Shorts are another option, black patent leather will look the best if you plan on wearing shorts. This goes for any bottoms you wear, NO DENIM, it looks ridiculous with a cat girl costume.

, Dresses can look amazing as well, if you plan on getting a dress, try not to get it in a solid color, this looks boring. Different colored tiger or leopard print is adorable. Your dress can be either pleated or straight, I would recommend getting a pleated one though, since it will make your waist look smaller. Another option is to go for a slinky, tight bodysuit or jumpsuit. These just look fabulous- the sexier the better.

, Heels are a must, or high-heeled boots. No other shoes will look halfway decent. Your heels should be at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) tall, and should look great with your costume. Platform heels look the best and they're not nearly as uncomfortable as they look. Same goes for boots, if you plan on getting boots they should be knee-high or thigh-high, ones with a thick heel look the best and are the most comfortable since you don't have to struggle to keep your balance in them. If you want to take it to the next level, get some stripper heels! If you can't find a color to match your costume, go with either clear, black, or white. Gold ones look great too.

, If you're not wearing boots and your wearing either a dress, skirt, or shorts, big fluffy leg warmers are a must! You can get them in a color to match your outfit or just get black or white. Fishnet thigh- high stockings look good no matter what you're wearing, they even look cute under your furry leg warmers, they can be the same color as your leg warmers or you can wear just black or white ones( NO BROWN), You should wear fishnet thigh highs with your costume no matter what, unless you're wearing thigh high boots, or short that aren't patent leather(and you shouldn't be wearing any other type of shorts anyway)

, You may not think jewelry is important, but it is. It brings out the colors of your outfit. Big hoop earrings look great, try to get ones with rhinestones, they can either be regular rhinestones or they can match the color of your outfit, these are optional though, if big earrings hurt your ears, then you don't have to wear them. A choker is essential, I recommend getting a regular rhinestone one with at least 3 rows of rhinestones, these can be found at costume jewelry shops, formal dress shops/boutiques, or you can order one online, just remember, the more rows of rhinestones, the better. If you don't want that much sparkle, you can always go with a simple, solid colored cat collar that is made for humans. Just don't go to the pet supply store and buy one that is actually meant for an animal, it looks stupid once you get it on. Just don't buy a collar that has studs/spikes, they're ugly and can be potentially dangerous. If you want to wear bracelets, try some rhinestone bangles in colors that match your outfit, but don't wear any more than 5.

, Buy some good quality foundation and mascara from a professional makeup counter or from Sephora. This is pricier than drugstore makeup but well worth it, if you don't want broken out skin and running mascara.You need to get some fake lashes, you can get these anywhere you like, just make sure that they're not too long or thick, or else you'll end up looking like a drag queen. Clinique is a good brand, and isn't overly expensive have the representative help you find the right foundation for your skin type and tone, have her try different ones on you to see which looks the best. For mascara, as long as it is department store quality, its fine. Now to apply your makeup, (make sure your face is clean)Start with applying your foundation, then take some black liquid eyeliner and create a thick line over each of your top lids, practice making a dramatic cat eye effect with your eyeliner(also called ""winged"" eyeliner) try to make the ""wing"" on each eye no more than half an inch long. Now have your mom or a friend help you put your fake lashes on, make sure they're securely glued. Now take a black eyeliner retractable pencil and line the inside of your bottom lash line, make it slightly thick. Now take your mascara and apply a few coats to your fake lashes, and put a very small amount on your bottom lashes. For your eyeshadow, you need to use black, brown, or gold and create the ""butterfly effect"". Eyeshadow is optional, but it is a very nice touch. If you have light eyebrows fill them in with a light brown brow pencil. For your lips, all you need is a clear or light pink gloss and a little skin colored lip liner.Finally, brush a powder the same color as your foundation, over your face, this gives you a perfect matte look.

, They are much more durable and you don't have to worry about them popping off, like press ons do and more often than not, they look much better than if you try to do them yourself. If you plan on getting them done professionally, ask to have the tips 1 inch (2.5 cm) to 1 1/2 long. Tell them you want the tips square. You can either have the tips painted or have your whole nail painted, that's your choice, just make sure the color will match your costume. If you want get a cute design, like zebra stripes. White nails with colored zebra stripes look awesome. If you have the money, get your toes painted to match if you're going to be wearing open toed shoes.

, Your hair doesn't have to be any particular color, long, straight hair looks best with a cat girl costume, but really anything goes. If you want to, you can put a few highlights of the color of your outfit in your hair. Just make sure that it is only temporary.

Cut these out and use them as templates.

, Trace around, then cut out the elephant ear., This is very simple. Draw a block-letter T in the appropriate proportion to the ears. Cut out the large T., Do this as follows:

Bend the top of the T over. Align this with the circle strip, above and in the middle of where you have already stapled on the elastic. Glue, tape or staple in place.

Choose a character.,
Observe your character.,
Plan your costume.,
Style your hair.,
Accessorize.,
Find a place to show it off.",How to Cosplay an Anime Character," This can be someone from a show, comic, movie or even band, or even a character you made up in your head and, while a lot of cosplay is, it doesn't have to be a Japanese character - you could well cosplay someone from an American, Chinese, or any other form of visual media. You could even cosplay a member of the opposite gender - it's been done, and it's been praised. It's all up to you.;
, What do they look like? How do they dress? What's their attitude like? Are they nice, mean, good, evil? These are things you want to find out in order to get into character. Consider doing some research over the internet - many mainstream persona have fan bases and websites dedicated to them, with information already in place for you. If not, review chapters or episodes of the media they appear in and take note of these things. You don't have to memorize their every action - just basic ways to identify them, i.e. speech patterns, attitude, catch phrases, etc.

, Often enough, the character will have one outfit which they wear either all the time, or during their most common activities. If not, choose your favorite out of the ones they're usually seen in. Many websites offer ready-to-wear outfits available for order, but if you're not fortunate enough to find the one you're looking for, a spectacular idea would be to make one yourself!

, Everyone's hair is different, and your character is no exception! The easiest way to copy their hairstyle would be by buying a wig from a cosplay website, or a wig of their hair color which you would then style yourself. Do make sure the wig looks realistic. There have been cases of cosplayers wearing pieces of fabric in the general shape of their character's hairstyle upon their heads - beware! This is not what you should aim for. If your character has a difficult hairstyle, use hair gel or hair clips to keep it in place.

, Does the character you're cosplaying have any piercings? Do they wear a belt, chain, necklace? Try to find something that looks similar. For piercings, you can use clip-ons or even stickers. If they have a tattoo, try to find a replica of it available for purchase (one of those tattoos that washes off in a couple of days). If unavailable, cover that part of your body with a piece of clothing, or, if all else fails, get someone to draw something similar on your skin with permanent marker - it washes off quickly, though, so don't rub it.

, You may have a fantastic costume, but wearing it out in public in an everyday situation is not advised. Instead, find a place where this type of creativity is appreciated - a convention for fans of an anime, manga, or simply cosplaying altogether. Do a bit of research on these type of conventions near you. They're a great way to have fun, express yourself, and meet others who are into the same things you are.

Decide who you want to cosplay.,
Decide how you want to go about getting your costume.,
If you have decided a character/person to cosplay and choose to make the costume yourself; it's a good start to make a list of what you have to make, how you shall make it and what you need to buy in order to make it.,
No matter if you buy the costume, you probably have hair, make up and maybe even lenses to buy and fix.,
It helps to sketch up your character from different angles.,
Decide how much time (and money) you should spend on making the costume.,
Practice on the make up, putting in and taking out the lenses and fixing your hair (or the wig).,
When everything is done, put everything on and look in the mirror.,
Be confident cosplaying.,
Make your grand debut!,
Have fun with it!",How to Cosplay," Do you just want a costume to wear around town, for fun, or do you want to wear it to an Anime Convention or other big event? If it's your first time cosplaying you may want to choose a character with a simpler outfit. However, if you do not mind strange stares and/or possible harassment, then feel free to go all out. For the latter, any costume will work, although unique costumes are more likely to stand out.;
, Consider your budget and time allowance. If you're short on time, making your costume from scratch may not be the best idea. Keep in mind that makeup and getting the perfect hairdo (regardless if it's your own hair or a wig) also takes time.

, For example, if your character is wearing a jacket and pants; what color are they? Which kind of fabric should you use? Are the clothes baggy or tight?

, Study your character's hair, eye color, and shape of face. Shall you use a wig or not? How should you style your hair? What kind of make up would be fitting and make your face look more like the character? Do you need colored lenses? It would be a good idea to read a little about how to change the shape of your face with make up. Don't forget props.

, It gives you a good view on how the character really looks. Write up your measurements on the sketch and try to figure out what the costumes measurements should be. If the character has any props, a weapon or just a bag for example, sketch them up too.

, The more difficult and detailed the costume is, the more time you'll need to make it. Give yourself more time than you think you need and be really realistic. Also, give yourself a little extra time to fix any eventual mistakes. It's better to have it done early than to have an unfinished costume. Decide in what order you should make everything you need.

, It will take time to make it good, so be patient and try different methods and products.

, Do you look like the character/person? If no, try to figure out why and consider making some changes. It's a good idea to ask a friend or someone else you trust if you look like the character and what you could change. Tell them to be honest, that's why you're asking.

, If you want, you could practice poses the character does a lot. You could also study the way the character walk and/or move, and try to imitate it. It's completely optional.

, Whether you're walking around town, at a party, or a convention, make sure you're having fun with it!

, If you don't have fun, you're not cosplaying the right way!

Get a rainbow wig.,
Wear an aqua blue top.,
Attach some wings to the back of the top.,
Get some aqua or rainbow leggings.,
Memorize some Rainbow Dash quotes.,
Learn about the weather.,
Be sporty.,
Read a lot.,
Help littler kids than you.,
Be brave.,
Ask for permission to go to a cosplay convention.",How to Be Like Rainbow Dash," One of the easiest ways to get a good Rainbow Dash costume is to get a rainbow-colored wig. These are typically available at costume stores, or you can order one online with a parent's permission.


To make your rainbow wig more like a mane, like Rainbow Dash has, get your parent to cut it into a mohawk, and try to style it so it falls back in a line down your neck, like a horse mane.
If you want, you can also order a rainbow tail online that looks a lot like Rainbow Dash's tail. Attach it to the back of a pair of sweatpants and you're in business.;
, To really get your costume looking right, try to get an aqua-blue hooded sweatshirt, t-shirt, or tank-top to turn into your Rainbow Dash costume. You don't really need to do anything to the shirt to make a costume out of it, just make sure it's the right color. With your wig, it'll start looking a lot like Rainbow Dash.

, Want to really go the extra mile? Cut some cardboard wings out of an old cereal box, or shoe-box with scissors. Get your parents to help you, if you need, and then get help sewing them on the back of your top, if you want to have wings.


Use markers or crayons to color the wings the same color as your top, so they match.

, Depending on how you want your costume to look, you could also kick up the rainbows another notch and get some ankle-warmers, or some whole leggings to match your top and your hair. Try and get the colors as close as possible.


Wear some rainbow-colored wrist-warmers, if you go with ankle-warmers, so it'll look like you're used to walking on four legs, like Rainbow Dash.

, Want to act like Rainbow Dash? Memorize some of the things she says and repeat them on a regular basis, when the time is right. Here are some Rainbow Dash quotes:


""It needs to be about 20% cooler.""
""Careful Derpy!""
""What about ""Super-Ultra-Extreme-Awesomazing?""
""I'm just glad I haven't been replaced by a bucket of turnips!""
""Time to take out the adorable trash.""
""Hey. I could clear this sky in ten seconds flat.""

, Rainbow Dash controls the weather in Ponyville, keeping the skies free of clouds for the Summer Sun Celebration. Unless rain is scheduled for that day, Rainbow Dash makes sure Ponyville always has nice, warm, sunny weather. You can't control the weather, but you can read the forecast, watch the Weather Channel, and try and find out what the weather will be like that day, so you'll be the one ""in charge"" or knowing.


Before you go to school, check the local news or the newspaper to find out what the weather will be like today. Memorize it, so you can seem as if you know automatically. ""I'd say there's about a 41% chance of humidity today,"" you can say to your friends.

, Above all else, Rainbow Dash is athletic and sporty. She loves running, playing outside, and getting physical. Try finding outside activities that you like doing and get outside and get your hands dirty.


Rainbow Dash can be pretty competitive, so don't be afraid to challenge your friends to contests and races on a regular basis.

, In the episode ""Read it and Weep"" Rainbow Dash discovers her love for reading. She's a lot more than just athletic, she's also really smart and a big lover of books. Find some books that you enjoy reading and always have one on your desk.


In another episode, she even reveals that she's writing a novel, about a Pegasus who's pretty much the most awesome ever. Try writing a book if you've got some ideas for one.

, In one episode, everyone goes on a camping trip and Rainbow Dash tells scary stories that scare Scootaloo. Scootaloo is too embarrassed and scared to say that the stories frightened her, even though she keeps acting scared throughout the whole trip. Finally, Rainbow Dash notices and instead of giving her a hard time, tells her that the stories scared her too once, and agrees to act as a big sister to Scootaloo.Don't be mean to kids younger than you, including young siblings. Be nice to them and help them out any time you can.

, When Rainbow Dash goes to Wonderbolt Academy, she ends up saving lots of ponies from disaster when Lightning Dust gets reckless with a tornado. Since she controls weather, she swoops in and saves everyone. If you want to be like Rainbow Dash, you've got to be willing to stand up for what you believe in. Help others and be brave in the face of challenges.


Rainbow Dash isn't reckless. Being brave doesn't mean doing dangerous things. She's smart and safe at the same time.

, Rainbow Dash is a popular costume at cosplay conventions, and they can be great ways to hang out with other fans of the character, see other cool costumes, and see how you might be able to improve your own.


Typically, BronyCon, the My Little Pony convention, is held in August of each year. Check http://www.bronycon.org to find out about where it will be this year."

Decide what character you want to cosplay.,
Look through your clothes to see if you already have similar items to the character.,
Look for a wig.,
If you are good at sewing, you can make your own outfit for things like the Prospit and Derse Dreamer outfits and the God Tier outfits.,
Decorate your shirt with either fabric paint or iron-ons.,
If you are cosplaying a troll, order grey face paint.,
Strange colors of makeup like blue and green lipstick can be found for relatively low prices on websites like Amazon and eBay.,
Have fun!",How to Cosplay a Homestuck Character," There are very many Homestuck characters but there are sheets to get you started. You can also do a non-canon outfit, such as Nepeta's god tier. Cosplaying a troll will involve being covered in face paint as well as making horns, so beginners may want to start by cosplaying as one of the kids as these are simpler.;
, This can save you a lot of time and money. You can paint the correct symbol on plain t-shirts without having to buy one which already has a symbol on it.

, Most people consider the white-haired characters to be blonde in real life. Some places to look for wigs are eBay, Hello Cosplay, Arda Wigs, and Match wigs. Depending on the length, cosplay wigs usually run around $20-40, but they are considerably cheaper from eBay although are usually lower quality.


All trolls have black hair (Eridan being the exception, his is dyed), so always get a black wig for trolls instead of dark brown. For the kids with dark hair however, black or brown could be used.

, It is also possible to find items like brightly colored pants in stores or charity shops, so make sure to look around before turning to DIY. You will have to make your own God Tier hood though, as the right capes and hoods can't be found in shops.

, Most iron-ons peel off over the course of a day, but Avery Dark T-Shirt Iron-Ons are very durable and can survive many washes. You can find them at a local store or somewhere like a Walmart. You can also look on Topatoco for troll and Beta kid shirts and What Pumpkin for the Alpha kids but these will be more expensive than making your own.

, There are many tutorials on MSPA forums and Tumblr on how to do troll makeup. There are a lot of options, such as Ben Nye, PAX, and Snazaroo. Use green face paint for cherubs.


There are tutorials on how to make troll arms out of grey tights to avoid using paint on your arms. These look better and don't rub off.
Wear grey tights if your legs are going to be visible.

, Ben Nye may be found in places that sell theater makeup, and Snazaroo can be found at Michael's and places as such.


Makeup can also be used for contouring if you are cosplaying a character of the opposite gender or to achieve a particular look. There are tutorials for how to do this online.

, Once your cosplay is complete, go to a convention or event and show your cosplay off! You can make panels like Promstuck, or organize a meetup in your town.

Stay casual.,
Attitude.",How to Be Like a Playmate," Playmates must stay in great physical condition in order to pose for Playboy magazine. You can stay fit too by joining a gym, or simply exercising close to home for no cost at all. Try going for an everyday jog or hike in your neighborhood or a nearby park, bike riding, or lifting weights in the house. Search the web for instructions on simple fitness exercises such as push-ups, sit-ups, planks, and an interesting and effective ab workout called the 'Stomach Vacuum'.;
, Along with exercising, you will want to eat right. Make sure your daily meals include healthy portions of fruits, vegetables, and vitamins. Drink water instead of coffee, tea, and energy drinks. Also, juices without artificial sugars and flavorings are a delicious and healthy beverage. Stay away from excessive alcohol and smoking of any sort.

, Whether your current hairstyle is short, medium, or long, you don't have to worry, Playmates have all lengths of hair.



Care: Wash and condition your hair with a gentle shampoo and nutrient-rich conditioner to keep it soft, shiny, and voluminous. You might want to straighten or curl your hair, but beware: heated styling tools can severely damage your hair even with the slightest use. So, make sure that you protect your hair with a heat protectant spray or serum when you do use hot tools.

Coloring: Dyes are also damaging, but if you feel like you want to brighten up your style, try going for a midnight black, rich chocolate brown, auburn red, or golden blonde. Often times, Playmates have platinum blonde hair, which can be sexy on some women, but rigid and/or fried looking on others. Be cautious when dying your natural hair color lighter.

, The natural look is beautiful and sexy, but most Playmates are wearing a little heavier makeup. Try the 'Cat-Eye' eyeliner look, or a sexy, smoldering 'Smoky Eye' look. Pair your eye makeup with a nude or sheer gloss, or a flattering shade of pink lipstick. Add a little blush in a color that matches your natural blush and you'll be set. The above look will go with any skin tone.

, Don't overdo your wardrobe with fancy dresses, 4-inch heels, or anything too frilly. You can look just as amazing in a simple white t-shirt and form-fitting jeans. The key to the Playmate look is to look simply sexy. Wear whatever you want, as long as it showcases your natural curves. You may want to consider adding a good amount of pink to your collection of clothes, as it's feminine and often the color included in Playmate photo shoots. Wear comfortable shoes such as tennis shoes (Converse, Vans, Ed Hardy's, Nike), flip-flops, flats, and wedge heels.

, The attitude part is always easier said than done. Just be yourself. Smile, laugh, make eye contact with the guys you think are cute. Hangout with your friends, go to the mall. Being yourself is sexier to guys than acting fake and preppy. Although there are loads of fake Playmates, there are plenty of real, down-to-Earth ones and you can be one of them.

Visit each prospective client in each area you mapped out.,
Decide which days to run each route.,
Be dependable.",How to Become a Gofer," This, in turn, will determine clientele you wish to serve.


Consider large corporations that can depend on you to run errands outside of their offices and small business owners who may have to close their doors whenever they need to run an errand themselves.
Think of clinics and medical buildings where there is no cafeteria. You can provide a service to them by making a lunch delivery every day.
Remember that there are many elderly persons at home or in a retirement village who would cherish a dependable errand gofer.;
, Make the route small enough that you have plenty of time to cover it within a half or full day's time. Leave yourself enough time to take new clients in that area. Map out several routes if you plan to become a gofer in a large city, or if you plan to cover several small towns.

, Consider having magnetic cards made for those people who tend to misplace loose papers and business cards. Consider making some letterhead, as well.

, Introduce yourself and your gofer service.


Try to speak to the highest-level person possible. Leave one or more business cards and perhaps a letter of introduction in case you don't get far up the ladder on the first visit.
Promise to check back with those who are not sure whether the company needs your services. Keep the promise and check back in a few days.

, Consider how much business you may have on any particular day. Check with promising clients to see if they would need your service every day, or just one or two days a week. Leave some time each day for emergency runs or unexpected problems.

, Decide what to do if you become ill or are unable to do the job for one day or a longer period of time. Consider having a backup person or a partner, and make sure your clients meet this person ahead of time.

Find out your deadline.,
Check convention guidelines for character restrictions.,

Pick your favorite character or character design.,
Define your comfort level.,
Talk to your friends.,
Choose a character with a similar body type to win contests.,
Break your costume down into parts.,
Have a test run.,
Choose two or more characters, if you can't choose just one!,
Use good judgement.",How to Choose the Right Cosplay Character," Each character requires a costume, so it's important to create a costume budget. Professionally-made cosplay costumes can be expensive, but that doesn’t mean you need to spend a lot of money to get the perfect costume.Buying a costume means you’ll likely obtain it faster, but you can also make one yourself, which keeps costs low.
Decide on a costume budget that allows you to obtain key accessories (like head pieces or weaponry).;
, The timing of conventions, cosplay parties, and friend gatherings will determine how soon you need your costume. If you have a large budget, buying a costume from a costume shop or professional costume designer is probably the best and fastest option. For a smaller budget, consider renting a costume from a local costume shop if you need it in a hurry.

If you aren’t in a hurry and you have a modest budget, consider making your own costume. There are lots of online resources for DIY costumes, and you could always buy the accessories that you aren’t able to create yourself.You could also borrow a costume (or buy it used) from a friend or fellow cosplay acquaintance.

, Some conventions are open to all cosplay, while others are genre or series specific. If there is a specific convention you are hoping to attend, check out its guidelines and character restrictions (if any).For example, there are some North American conventions specific to Harry Potter, Disney, Star Wars, and Anime.
These genre-specific conventions may deny you admission if your costume does not belong in the designated genre.

, Before picking a character, make note of your current obsessions and long-term series favorites. This will help you narrow down your character choices., Once you’ve made a list of your top favorite series, identify your favorite character among them. This could be a character you most identify with or most admire.


If you have a few favorite characters, choose which character has the best costume, look, and design based on your personal style.Strength, beauty, magical ability, talent, status, and intelligence are examples of admirable character attributes you may want to consider.Bright colors, fashion accessories, hair style, outfit choice, and footwear are examples of character design you may want to consider.

, If you still can’t choose among your favorite character designs, decide what costume you’ll be most comfortable in. For example, if you don’t feel comfortable wearing high heel boots, Batgirl may not be a good choice!, If you’re headed to a meet-up with your friends, find out what characters are already taken. Perhaps your friends could use you to go as a specific character to fill out a series cast, which might help you decide what to be, or maybe there are already three Sailor Moons attending, which might help you decide what not to be!, If you plan to enter cosplay costume contests or adhere to cosplay social stereotypes, you’ll need to choose a character with a body type that matches your own and a costume you can replicate with exactness. Judges rate costumes based on accuracy and detail.There are no official cosplay rules outside of contests, so you should feel free to choose whatever character and costume you like. You can also add your own flare to the costume. Don’t be afraid to be unique.

, Putting a character costume together can be intimidating, even once you’ve decided on the actual costume! Break your costume down into sections, such as wig/hair pieces, clothing items, footwear, jewelry, weapons, etc., to make it easy to gather all the components.Make yourself a costume checklist to stay organized as you gather all the components of your costume.

, Take your character for a test spin around your room before you debut the costume to your friends and family or at a convention. Whether you buy, rent, or make your costume, the key to truly choosing you character is becoming your character. Take some time to get familiar with the wear and feel of your costume as you breathe life into the character.If you have trouble getting into character, consider taking a community acting class or watching online acting tutorials to better fit the part.

, There is no rule in cosplay that says you can’t be more than one character! If you have two or more favorites, choose them all! Although it may take awhile to arrange the finances and components you need for several costumes, cosplay can be a lifelong pursuit.Develop one costume at a time until your closet boasts of all your favorite characters.

, Cosplay is a fun, exciting, creative world, but cosplay bullying, discrimination, harassment, and shaming are all potential dangers. Choose and embody your character with enthusiasm and confidence, but be sure to guard yourself against any potential risks, and never let being your character override your good sense to avoid danger.Even if it’s not accurate to the character or costume, always keep your cell phone with you in case of emergencies.
At conventions, you can yell “security!” if you need immediate assistance."

Find some armor.,
Get a sword.,
Name your steed.,
Take a knightly name yourself.,
Find a lady to love.,
Be dubbed a knight.,
Leave your former habitations and take to the open road.",How to Become a Knight Errant," You could start by checking your attic; perhaps a crusading ancestor has left something there to rust which a little polishing can make perfectly serviceable. If this is not the case, do not despair. Try the local antiques shop. If that also fails you, an old bathtub will suffice. If your ancestral plate still lacks some essential necessary, for example, a helmet, this can easily be improvised using tin foil, or an empty washing up bottle.;
, Again, your attic or the local antiques shop may be helpful. If these fail you, consider using a spear instead. Many noble knights have used spears.

, Ideally this should be a horse, but a motorcycle is an acceptable modern equivalent. The name of your steed should be grandiloquent, noble and sonorous, as befits the creature whose destiny it is to endure the spurs of the greatest knight of history. A good name for a horse would be ""Tontasiento"", a bad one ""Buttons"". Do your research on the history of these times and names.

, This should include a ""Sir"", so that all are aware of your chivalric intentions, and a suitable nom de guerre. It is customary to append the name of your town or area, so that your glory will redound upon your former residence. As a knight errant, your new home will of course be the open road, and your new neighbours the world. As an example, consider ""Sir Carson of Milton Keynes"".

, A knight without a lady-love is a tree without leaves or fruit, a body without a soul. It is essential to the role. It is not necessary for the lady so chosen to reciprocate your feelings, or even to be aware of them. In fact, it is essential that she not reciprocate it; it is the lot of a Knight Errant to be cursed with an unkind love. One thing to bear in mind is that you must defend the honour of your lady love with your life, and suffer none to insult her with impunity. It is therefore advisable to make choice of as virtuous a damsel as possible. Be certain to send any giants you happen to defeat in your travels to pay homage to her.

, Ideally your induction into the orders of chivalry should be performed by a queen, but in practice any woman will do. Remember, on the inside, she's a princess!

, Defeat any giants you encounter, assist the needy, and be prepared to uphold your profession and the honour of your lady with your strong right arm, if necessary.

Get a wig or style your hair.,

Add some accessories.,
Slip on some women’s shoes.",How to Pretend to Be a Girl1," If you have long hair already, then you can just style it. If your hair is short, then you may want to get a wig to enhance your feminine look. When you are choosing a wig, make sure that you purchase one that is high quality if you want your look to be more convincing. A poor quality wig may not look as good.If you are dressing up for a drag show or play, then you can go with an over the top wig, such as something that is ultra-long, styled like a bee hive, or dyed an unnatural color.
If you just want to see what it feels like to dress as a girl, then try curling your hair, using a flat iron for a pin-straight look, or braiding your hair.
Long hair will help you to look feminine and it can also provide some coverage from masculine features such as a square jaw, but having long hair is not absolutely necessary if you are just dressing up to see how it feels. If you have short hair, then you can also try styling it in a feminine way. For example, you can use mousse and curl the longer pieces, or wear an accessory, such as a headband or barrette.;
, Makeup can help to accentuate your features and give your face a more feminine appearance. If you have never worn makeup before, then you may need to watch some tutorials on how to apply it. Try checking Youtube for some basic makeup application tutorials.


If you just want to get a feel for what it is like to wear makeup or if you want to try to pass as a girl, then stick with a light layer of foundation, some light eye shadow and mascara, and a nude or pink lipstick.
If you want something more dramatic, such as for a drag show, then you can put on a heavy layer of foundation, black eyeliner, fake lashes, and some bold red lipstick.

, Wearing women’s clothing is an essential part of looking like a girl. Lots of girls wear unisex clothing, such as pants, jeans, and t-shirts. However, dresses are your best bet for drag shows because they are flashier. If you just want to get a feel for what it is like to dress as a girl, then wearing a dress or a skirt with a girl’s top will give you a better idea.


Choose a style that flatters you and shows off your best features. For example, you can choose a short skirt if you want to show off your legs, or a sleeveless top if you want to show off your arms.
If you are going for an exaggerated look, such as for a drag show or theater production, then you might want to choose something flashy, ultra-feminine, or elaborate. For example, you could go with a sequined dress, a fluffy tulle skirt, or a hot pink evening gown.
If you are interested in dressing as a girl to pass as a girl, then try to choose clothing that is in style. Wearing current trends may help make it easier for you to pass as a woman., Earrings, necklaces, bracelets, scarves, and other accessories can help to enhance your feminine look. Choose an accessory that complements your outfit and that makes you feel pretty.


If you are dressing up with the intention of trying to pass as a girl or see how it feels, then you could go with a simple pair of pearl earrings or a dainty gold necklace.
If you are going for a more dramatic look, such as for a drag show or theater production, then go for some long dangling earrings, a long glittering costume jewelry necklace, or a lots of bangle bracelets.

, Shoes are an essential part of your look. Select some women’s shoes that go with your outfit and that you will feel comfortable wearing. High heels are ultra-feminine, but they can be difficult to walk in. You will probably need to practice walking in them before you go out in public.If you are dressing up for drag or a play, then high heels may provide the most dramatic effect. Just make sure that you can walk in them without falling!
If you are experimenting with women’s clothing because you want to see how it feels or possible pass as a woman in public, then try starting out with some ballet flats, some low heel dress shoes, or a fashionable pair of sandals.
Make sure that your toenails are painted if you will be baring your toes.

Shave facial hair, legs, and armpits.,
Tuck your penis.,
Put on a bra.,
Wear slimming undergarments.,
Consider wearing hip or butt padding.",How to Pretend to Be a Girl2," Getting rid of excess facial hair, armpit hair, and leg hair is crucial when dressing as a woman. Having visible facial hair can be a dead giveaway, so make sure that you give yourself a close shave before you start making the transformation.


If you don’t want to shave your armpits, then just make sure that you are wearing something that covers them completely, such as a long-sleeve or ¾ length sleeve top.
If you don’t want to shave your legs, then you can also go with some opaque tights. Wear two pairs for extra coverage., Tucking your penis back is an important part of passing as a girl. To tuck you penis, pull it back towards your buttock and between your legs. Then, put on two pairs of form-fitting panties to help keep it in place.Another option is to use a gaff. You can buy or make a gaff.
To make a gaff, cut the elastic waistband off of a pair of pantyhose and then cut the top off of a sock. Thread the waistband through the sock so that the sock is centered.
To use a gaff, slip your legs through the two openings in the elastic and pull it up like a pair of underwear. As you do so, tuck your penis back. Then, adjust the gaff as needed and put on your panties. The gaff will help to keep your penis tucked back.

, Wearing a bra is an essential part of looking like a girl. Choose a bra that fits around your chest comfortably. Measure your chest around the widest part to see what size bra you will need. For example, if your chest is 38 inches around, then purchase a bra that is a size 38.


The cup sizes are lettered, such as A, B, C, D, etc. A is on the smaller end while a D cup is on the larger end. You can choose any cup size you like, but keep in mind that choosing a large cup size may make it hard to fit into some clothing. To play it safe, go for a B or C cup.However, if you are dressing up for a drag show or as part of a play, then you may want to go for a larger bra size.
You will also need to stuff the cups. You can stuff the bra with socks, tissues, balloons filled with a few ounces of water, or special silicone bra pads.

, Wearing slimming undergarments or shapewear can help you to get a smoother curvier figure. These garments can also help to taper your waist, which will help to make you look more feminine.Try wearing a corset or girdle, a pair of shapewear shorts, or a pair of pantyhose with a high waist.

, If you don’t have much fat on your hips or buttocks, then wearing a padded undergarment or adding padding to your undergarments can help you to achieve a curvier look.You can purchase pre-padded undergarments or just slip some padding into your underwear or pantyhose.
For a drag show or play, you may want a more exaggerated figure. Try using more padding or even a pillow to create the appearance of curvy hips and big butt.

Practice your walk.,
Sit with your ankles or legs crossed.,
Adjust your voice.,
Smile and laugh often.",How to Pretend to Be a Girl3," While there is no one way to walk like a girl, you may want to practice walking in a more feminine way. Instead of taking straight, hard strides, try to walk with a bit of a sway to your hips and lightness in your step. Unless you are going for an over-the-top walk, such as for a drag show, try not to place your feet directly in front of each other or pretend you are walking on a line because this can make your walk look too exaggerated.If you are just trying to experiment with what walking like a girl is like, then just aim for some slight movement in your hips as you take each step.

, A masculine way of sitting is with legs spread wide and arms out to take up more space. Instead, keep your knees together and your elbows in close to your body.You can cross your ankles or cross your knees if you feel comfortable doing so. This seated position will help to give you a more feminine appearance.


You can also fold your hands on your lap or place them gently on the table in front of you.

, Women tend to have higher voices than men and this can give you away as a man dressing up like a woman.If you have a deep voice, then you may want to practice speaking at a higher octave.


However, keep in mind that some women have deeper voices, so try not to feel self-conscious if your voice is a little deeper than some other women’s voices.
If you are dressing as a woman for a drag show or play, then you can either use your normal voice or go with an over-the-top girl voice.

, Some women tend to smile and laugh more than men. Smiling and laughing more often can help you to appear more feminine, so try to smile and laugh a lot. Unless it is part of your drag show or character, you don’t need to wear a big grin constantly or laugh all of the time. If you are just trying to get a feel for more feminine mannerisms, then try to smile and laugh a little more than you usually would. You may also want to practice your feminine laugh. Listen to how other women laugh and then try to imitate it.

, A pair of vice grips work well, however, you can also cut right below the metal tip with a hacksaw.

, The shaft of the arrow might have cracked while removing the tip. To fix this problem wrap duct tape around the tip of the arrow building up the width of the tip (half an inch down) to the diameter of a penny.

, Take a penny and set it at the top of the ""platform"" of tape on the tip. Make a cross with duct tape and secure the penny to the tip of the arrow.
This step prevents the arrow from being able to penetrate through the tip of your padding.

, Make sure the foam is above the penny! Make sure the foam makes the arrow around 1.5 to 2"" in diameter.

,,, Do Not Squish the Open Cell Foam!

, Make sure about an inch or two of the open cell sticks above the closed cell. (Attach with Duct Tape)

Develop a background story for your character.This will help bring your character to life.,
Define the personality traits of your character.,
Know your character’s motives.During a game, your character will be faced with one situation after another, and each situation will require a choice.,
Ensure that your character continually develops.As the game progresses, your character gains knowledge and experience by going through trials, defeating enemies, overcoming challenges and completing quests.",How to Improve Your Roleplay1," Define fundamentals like your age, where you’re from and where you’re going. Are you on a mission? Who are your parents? Do you have a significant other or children? If so, where are they? Are you wealthy or poor? Do you work or practice a trade? Does your character have a destiny?Establishing the basic elements of a character's backstory is incredibly important, but you can get far more detailed and specific if you’d like.
The backstory can be as rich as you desire.;
, Avoid basing your character’s personality traits on your own, which is a common pitfall. The experience is much richer if you create traits objectively.Ask yourself questions like: Is your character good, evil, or a complicated mix of both? How about aggressive or defensive? Brave? Kind? Is your character impulsive or does he or she act with common sense? Is he/she charming? Despicable? Trustworthy?


Allow your character to have flaws.The game will be more interesting when your character is realistic and imperfect.

, These choices dictate where the game goes. You will need to define what your character’s motives are in order to make appropriate and realistic choices.


For example, imagine a character who has run away from home after being shunned by his father for being a thief. He meets a group of distinguished adventurers in a tavern and is invited to join them. He must make a decision.
After being shamed by his father, the character wants to gain some prestige and respect so that he can return home one day unashamed. This is his motive.
It would make sense for this character to choose to join this group of adventurers, since it could provide opportunities to gain respect and redeem himself.

, These events should contribute to the development of your character in a realistic way.For example, after defeating a string of enemies, it would make sense for your character to feel more empowered, make bolder choices and take on challenges that he/she wouldn’t have tried at the beginning of the game.
Think about how new knowledge, experience, and skills might influence your character’s choices moving forward.

Find some friends for the LARP.,
Get an arena or an adventure setting.,
Congratulations.",How to Live Action Role Play (LARP) With Few Supplies," you need at least 2-4 people. The one who invited them should be the GM, or the Game Master (person who runs the game). Let everyone make their characters, you may need to show them through the step, if they are new, then yes. but for you to teach them you have to know, so look on the next step.


To make a character, decide race/class. The race is not needed. classes could be things like warrior, paladin, monk, shadow knight, wizard, priest, ranger, rogue, druid or even summoner. in the tips there will be guides on the classes. after that get some equipment.maybe foam Nerf swords for swords, or ""Whack-a-mole"" mallets taped to a stick for a hammer, or for spells get balls or Nerf darts to throw, poison could be paint/jelly, random books for spell books, bows and arrows with tape about 3 inches (7.6 cm) thick over the tip.
Come up with some races, like elf, dwarf, human, sprite, goblin, giant, troll, orc, undead, angel, demon and maybe even animal people. Each race should have its own modifiers, like double armor or damage, and also some good skills like fairies might have a heal, but elves may be able to swim and run no problem, as well as double roll for death luck rolls.;
, The GM would have to come up with an adventure, or you could just make it a war game where you all just fight or team up and fight. When you get hit in the arm, put it behind your back, when you get hit in the leg, you can't use that leg, torso/ incredibly light shots to the neck mean death, hard to neck or anywhere else are considered out shots where the hitter is out. After the battle the person could level up. they each get 50 points to divide among their HP and MP. every 10 points means another hit left until death or more spells available. The person could also gain abilities or new spells, or even more weapons or armor.

, After the battle make sure to congratulate everyone, and after someone dies they roll a die, if they can't defeat death, one hit from death and you're done and he uses a gun and god armor but if you roll, a 6 is needed to not lose anything, if not some max hp/mp/ a level/ an item/ a spell is taken, or anything that the GM wants to do.

If it's size is too small then it won't pass for a textbook, but don't go too large or you'll just create more work. Make sure you'll be able to write on the cover with a sharpie too, fabric covers never last anyway.;
, Using a Sharpie or label maker, label the cover of the book with the name you want it to be. Make sure it fits the class it will be in. Remember that a lot of classes will using 101, 102, Basics, or Advanced for titles also. After you have done that, go on to label the spine of the book with the same title as the cover.

, If the pages aren't already numbered, go through with a fine tip sharpie and number each page. You can get creative and use roman numerals too. Don't skip a page or this step will end in ruin. When you get to the end, leaf through it to make sure that it's legible.

, If you've ever seen a textbook, it's likely to have a student name box, using a ruler and pen, create this box. All you need is three columns and a couple rows. Make one column about 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) and the last two 1 inch (2.5 cm). Label the longest one as 'Student Name'. And the smaller two 'Date Received' and 'Date Returned'.

, Print out pictures or information on dragons or write down recipes for spells. Make the ingredients added in. Write verses to spells or incantations and a dictionary in the back. Throw in assessment questions or study guides scattered throughout the chapters.

Explore a wide range of media for inspiration.Books, short stories, movies, and television shows are all fertile ground for inspirational narratives and plot lines.,
Use vivid descriptions to set the place and atmosphere.,
Base the overall narrative around a central conflict.Within your storyline there should be many smaller conflicts, snags and obstacles for the characters to navigate, but have these all relate back to the central conflict.,
Set up scenarios that move the plot forward.",How to Improve Your Roleplay2," Don’t limit yourself to the fantasy genre when you’re looking for inspiration – check out lots of different genres for unique ideas.


If you find yourself really stuck, go online and check out some of the random plot generator websites.The plot prompts you get from these websites can range from serious to very silly, but you never know what might kick start your imagination!

, For example, if you wanted to write about a character walking into a city, your description of the setting should not stop at, “Elrond walked along the path into the city.” Discuss the path – is it straight or crooked? Does the path look frequently used or is it overgrown? What part of the city is the path in? What do the city buildings look like? Is the area safe? What time of day is it? Is it raining, overcast or sunny?Your description doesn't need to answer all of these questions. Aim to include enough detail so that everyone can envision the setting clearly.
If something about the setting is very unusual, spend extra time on those details. Include a backstory about how and/or why this strangeness came to be.

, This will make your narrative cohesive. It will also create the sense that your characters are progressing through relevant situations that will help to ultimately resolve the central conflict.


Subplots are fine and expected. However, make sure there will be a way for you bring that subplot back around to the central narrative.
Try to keep any irrelevant or external plot elements to a minimum., Make sure your characters encounter situations that will require action. Every encounter doesn’t need to be negative, but you do need to include plenty of obstacles that the characters must face.Set up scenarios that could go in multiple directions, allowing the players to make choices that progress the game.


Some choices should be minor, but the majority of them need to be important and move the narrative forward.
When you set up a situation that could go in multiple directions, be prepared with unrevealed backstory and setting for each of them."
"
Turn off the TV and minimize all other distractions.If possible, ban cell phone use completely during game play.,
Change the lighting in the room.,
Use sound to enhance the atmosphere.,
Rearrange room elements to strengthen the atmosphere.",How to Improve Your Roleplay3," Pulling out a mobile phone while another player is sparring with an angry wizard will destroy the atmosphere in the room pretty fast.


If natural light spilling in from nearby windows is distracting and/or conveys the wrong mood, cover them with blankets.
Set up the game in a room that doesn’t have a lot of other things going on.
An empty attic, for example, would be an excellent place to set up.

, Dim or turn out the lights and use candles.If you’d prefer to avoid possible fire hazards, try repositioning the room’s light sources instead. For example, you could move all the lamps into the next room and allow just a little of their light to spill into the game room.


You can get even more creative by throwing patterned and/or colored scarves over the lampshades.
As the plot progresses, make sure to change up the lighting to coordinate with new scenarios and settings.

, Music is one option, although most contemporary music would throw off the fantasy setting completely. For a no-fuss solution, stream an internet radio station that plays classical, baroque, or Celtic music.


Using non-music sounds can greatly enhance a fantasy setting, as well.
For example, you could play a CD that features nature or ocean sounds to intensify jungle or maritime settings and scenarios., Put computers on the other side of the room, out of everyone’s direct line of vision. Have the game master sit in a chair that positions them above the other players. You can also use room elements to mimic setting characteristics.


For example, in anticipation of a sea scenario, you could set up a fan in the corner of the room to mimic an ocean breeze."

Learn what roleplay is: Roleplaying is when a person takes the role of a character and acts it out with a partner taking the role of another character.,
Decide which category you fall into:



Beginner: A type of roleplayer that is new to the process.,
Design your character:  Make it your own

,
While you can spend hours working up every aspect of a character’s life and personality, you need know only enough to make the character believable to you.,
I’ll go through the process they present, following the same steps they do and giving the same advice.,
Objective: Another important question to ask regarding your character, one that’s also frequently overlooked, is: what is your character trying to achieve in life?,
The objective must always be difficult to attain.,
Some categories of objectives (note that this list was originally intended for villains, though I’ve extended it some) you could find a more specific objective in:


Immortality
Wealth
Military Power
Political Power
Magical Power
Divine Power
Revenge
Self-Aggrandizement
Love
Peace
Security
Family
Patriotic

,
Motive: Next to the question of what your character is trying to achieve is the question of why.,
Achievement - Someone with this need sets out to accomplish difficult tasks.,
Affiliation - Someone with the need for affiliation enjoys being around people, enjoys being with friends and will accept people readily.,
Aggression - Someone who needs aggression enjoys combat and argument.,
Autonomy - Someone with the need for autonomy tries to break away from restraints, confinement, or restrictions of any kind.,
Exhibition - Someone with this need wants to be the center of attention.,
Safety - Someone who needs safety does not enjoy exciting activities, especially if danger is involved.,
Nurturing - Someone with the need to nurture gives sympathy and comfort, assisting others whenever possible.,
Order - Someone with this need is concerned with keeping their personal effects and surroundings neat and organized.,
Power - Someone with the need for power attempts to control the environment and influence or direct other people.,
Succor - Someone who needs succor frequently seeks the sympathy, protection, love, advice, and reassurance of other people.,
Understanding - Someone with this need wants to understand many areas of knowledge.,
I’d like to make a note here and say that choosing the obvious motive for certain classes isn’t always the most interesting way to go.,
Personality: When we describe other people to one another we tend to do so by picking one or two particular traits.,
For this step in particular I tend to use a table listing a large number of general personality traits.,
Attitudes and Behaviors: Determining how your character regards and treats other people helps decide how to roleplay an encounter when other characters meet yours.,
Tastes and preferences: A character’s tastes and preferences make them more distinctive.,
Surroundings: Though much of your character’s surrounding will likely be determined by the game it might still help to give some thought to this.,
Grammar, Punctuation and Grammatical Errors: Now in order to be literate you have to practice on these vital parts in literate role playing.,
Find a nice site & start role playing!

",How to Do Literate Roleplay," Roleplaying gives you a chance to create your own story or to alter the story of your favorite character. It can be done throughout all genres, from everything to Harry Potter to Warrior Cats. Or you could make up your own genre. You could create your own world or take My Little Pony and set it in Medieval Times. The sky is the limit here. Also, it is a wonderful and fun way to improve your writing skills;
, They generally type anywhere from a one liner to a paragraph, but not much more than that. There is nothing wrong with being a beginner as well all must start somewhere. Remember that being a beginner does not mean you lack literacy!

Semi-Literate: A type of roleplayer that types generally one paragraph to four paragraphs at most. This is generally where most people are on the spectrum and it is a very good place to be. There is good quality here as well as a good bit of quantity, but is not as intense as advanced literate.

Advanced-Literate: A type of roleplayer who generates novel-length posts, which are four paragraphs minimum for the most part. There is a lot of pressure here because advanced-literates often expect a great amount of quantity as well as quality.

,, If you have a concise and clear picture of your character, it is easier to make him or her come alive for the other players.

, I’ll strip off and rephrase things to remove their focus on creating villains, though do keep in mind that original purpose they created it for. You don’t have to do all these steps or do them in the order they’re presented. They’re just meant to give you some ideas for things to look at and hopefully make it easier to define your character and make him or her come alive. For example, personally I tend to begin with name, race, class and gender (which aren’t even listed).

Occupation: One of the questions to make your character more believable, and oddly enough one that’s often not really answered, is: what does your character do for a living? For WAR that is when your character is not fighting in a war.

, What is your character’s ultimate goal? What would your character answer when asked, in the larger sense, “what do you want”? This does not necessarily have to be an achievable or realistic goal. For example, certain power-hungry characters might have a secret ambition to try to become a god. Of course, it should be a goal the character could work towards, something that’s meaningful even if probably not achievable. If you know where your character is trying to get then that helps with what steps the character takes to get there, and that can definitely give your character more depth.

, The harder the objective is to accomplish, the better it is to roleplay. The secret to all drama is difficulty. Difficulty is the fuel that lights the fires of our roleplaying. The greater the struggle, the more the excitement; the larger the risk, the greater the suspense. But the objective must also be something you can do something about; if it is just philosophical then it can’t drive your character’s actions. The purpose of the objective is to get you away from thinking of yourself and stay fixed on what your character is thinking.

,, What drives your character, why does he/she do the things he/she does? A motive is a persistent concern for some goal. In other words, a motive is a need. Your character has a need for something (or some things) and that drives them to their actions, whether they realize it or not. What creates the intentions behind the actions? There is a variety of needs that can motivate people, some of which include (numbered to make randomization easier):

, This person might maintain high standard and work towards distant goals. They might enjoy competition and are generally willing to put forth more effort to attain excellence.

, This person would make efforts to win friendships and maintain associations with people.

, This person is easily annoyed and willing to hurt people getting in their way. They might seek to “get even”.

, They enjoy being unattached, free from people, places, or obligations, and may be rebellious when faced with restraints.

, This person enjoys having an audience and engages in behavior that wins the notice of others. They may enjoy being dramatic or witty.

, They avoid risk of bodily harm and seek to maximize personal safety.

, They’re interested in caring for children, the disabled, or the infirm, and offer a “helping hand” to those in need. This person readily performs favors for others.

, They dislike clutter, confusion, and lack of organization. They are also interested in developing methods for keeping materials methodically organized.

, This person expresses opinions forcefully and tends to enjoy the role of leader, which they may assume spontaneously.

, They might feel insecure or helpless without such support and confide difficulties readily to a receptive person.

, This person often has a strong intellectual curiosity and values the synthesis of ideas and logical thought.

, For example, it might make sense to give a Bright Wizard a need for understanding, wanting to understand (bright) magic and perhaps the universe at large. But what if, instead, he had a need for nurturing? What kind of bright wizard would that make? Maybe one who seeks to use his powers over fire to help people. An interesting question there is also what would’ve made the person with that need choose the path of a Bright Wizard? Also, in general I tend to pick two motives for my character to give them a bit more depth; a character with a single driving motivation quickly becomes one-dimensional.

, You might describe someone as cocky and perceptive, or as kind and shy. As such it might be a good idea to pick two or more dominant personality traits which serve as a first impression of the character. These traits should be consistent and reinforce one another. But what might add extra interest to your character, make them more memorable, is giving them a seemingly contradictory trait. This added contrast can serve to add more depth to your character, making them more than just ruthless killing machines, but also having a soft spot.

, I find this table very useful myself, but of course you don’t have to limit yourself to those; any character traits are usable.


Dominant Traits 1: Practical
Dominant Trait 2: Perfectionist
Contradictory Trait: Caring

, A person’s attitudes are not always consistent with their behavior. Someone might treat everyone very nicely and actually pity them for not being as smart and gracious. And people often treat others differently depending on their relationship and the situation. Two important sets of attitudes and behavior to identify for a new character are: 1. attitude towards others, and 2. behavior towards others. Try to think of various groups of people and define these two for each; a knight likely has a different set of attitudes and behavior to his superiors than to common peasants.

, Unusual tastes add color and intensity. Try to think of thinks like: what is your character’s favorite food, what is their favorite color, what kind of music does your character like, etc, etc. Unusual tastes definitely help your character stand out, but even normal tastes help to flesh out your character. A warrior, a priest and your character walk into a bar; what does your character order to drink? Having some simple questions like these answered beforehand can help smooth out roleplaying, though I've also found that at times just spur-of-the-moment decisions like this can help make your character feel like they’re growing (I once had a character who preferred to drink cinnamon tea just because when introducing her I decided on the spur of the moment to have her drinking that). No need to define your character in detail; just enough to get a good handle on him/her.

, Where does your character live and, more importantly, how do they keep that place? Is it very cluttered, or neatly organized, or does your character keep his/her place of living very sparse? What kind of things does your character surround him/herself with? And most of all, why? Why does your character choose to do this? And if not actively busy where does your character spent his/her time? Where is your character when you're not logged in? Some might lock themselves up in their room, others might spend all their spare time in the local pub, or perhaps spend the time training, or perhaps frolicking through the forest or taking long walks on the beach.

, For example, how can one call you literate if you write,""Shi w4ks tr00 d4 b3ch lukin fur da letle tirtle, etc."" No matter how excessively you write you need to be great in all these. D01ng th1s w1ll n0t w0rk. Dis tuu.

Figure out who you are.,
Find out one kintype to narrow it out.,
Try to find some memories from your canon.,
Look at your questioning kintype.,
Do a past life regression.

,
If you find out you are kin with the character, learn that it is okay.",How to Figure Out Your Fictionkin Type," First, watch/see/read the whole of your source material. If there is a big plot twist, test to see if you remember anything. When you see it (the plot twist), does it feel all too familiar? Does it feel like you already know this? If you do, it is probable that you are kin. Watch all your source material and look at all of the character's details. Which one calls out to you the most? If you question two, follow the steps below.;
, Some people only have one kin type from the same canon, some have multiple. To make it simple, you should narrow it down to one kintype to figure it out. Find which one you identify with the most and make it in an order. Let's do Steven Universe as an example. First you would do Ruby, Steven then Sugilite. You do not have to do this, but to make it simple, it is easier to do this.

, A canon is basically the source material, with some differences. Look through yourself and your source material. Does anything seem like it fits in, yet it isn’t in the show/book/audio? Don’t forget to question the other kin types that we mentioned earlier, it might fit in there. Find the people you were close to romantically, friendship wise or otherwise and look to see if you share those relationships that you used to. Do you feel like you have a crush on them or want to be friends with them?

, When you look at them, do you feel like “That's me!”? If you go on Tumblr and people draw pictures of your kin and the description says “don’t tag as kin/me/id” do you feel as if it's silly, because it’s a picture of you? These are things that happen to you, and your feel /very/ kin with the said character. Dress up in clothes similar to them, and see if it feels all too familiar.

,, Many people say that it is bad to be kin, you're delusional or you need to be locked up, and so forth and it’s not true. Being kin is not a delusion, due to it being a spiritual or coping mechanism. You might want to even find people from your cannon to connect with. There are also kin networks that you can find people who share the same source material that you are from.

Create a character.,
Choose a type of character.,
Learn to type with both hands, it will go a long way.,
Try to image your character or what you're trying to describe.",How to Create a Chatango Role Playing Character," There are three pieces to the structure of creating a character.


Bone, it is your character's body without clothes on. Literally, it is the height, the name, the age, the weight, the size, the strength, the abilities, the powers, the everything up to this point and after all it has been through.
Flesh, it is your character's everything about them, literally. What are they like? Tell all that you want and think that other people should know so that they can make a choice about role playing with you or not.
Past, it is your character's past. Why are or why aren't they supposed to be the way that they are, or why are they the way they are? Does your character hold a grudge with a previous foe? Does your character feel depressed because of a lack of nurturing as a young child? It doesn't matter as long as it is somewhat different each time.;
, With Chatango a person is entitled to a much more broad load of characters that range from vampires to other creatures to plain but powerful races of human. Most of the time, you'll see speed role-players. They are a little newbie, so don't go too hard on them. Most of the time those with the more decorated profiles are much more better at role playing but not always more open and friendly.

, Don't be drawn too quickly to the speed role playing because that is how bad habits (and rps) form! It is best to be analytic about the different styles of Role-playing. They include but are not limited to: Paragraph, semi-para, multi-para, sentence, the less turn-based ""speed"" which in my own personal experience and my own personal opinion should not be classified as a valid form of Role-playing. I would call it fucking around.


Paragraph or ""Para"" in colloquial and general abbreviation is a type of role-playing that is usually done in paragraph after paragraph after paragraph. It is sometimes called Multi-para depending on the amount of paragraphs that are used. An immense amount of detail is usually used for this style, especially when it takes more than one Chatango post.
Semi-para or ""Semi"" in colloquial and general abbreviation is a type of role-playing that is so very similar to Para, but usually isn't more than one post and about five to six lines of text.
Sentence has no colloquial classification for it. It is much shorter and usually requires just a single line of information most of the time. It can be two or three more but those are generally the rules.
Last and least, speed. This method of role playing is very very lazy and simple. If someone ""slashes"" at you can either just say ""*dodges*"" or ""*ducks*"". It takes no effort whatsoever to think of what to do, how to dodge or anything, but the upside is you can usually expect a response due to its quick and under-achievement as a ""registered"" style of Role-playing.

, For example:


Imagine a person in front of you. What is their eye color? Their hair color? Do they have an expression that tells you whether they're kind or horrid? Do they give off an aura of some sort? What do they wear?

What it might look like: I stopped, frozen as I managed to get a look at him. He sat on a bench, laid back. People had always said he was a demon, so I would image him with blood red eyes and dark hair, but it was not like that at all. He had blonde, short hair and light blue eyes - the color of the sky. It looked like he had no troubles whatsoever because of his calmness, the expression in his eyes. His attire was his usual school uniform. As I stepped a bit closer to him, I felt at ease when he noticed me. I raised my hand and waved, smiling. ""Mind if I sit with you?"" I asked. He returned my smile and shrugged. ""Only if you want to.""

They need friends but not groupies.

Don't worry about what anyone else is doing. You don't have to be part of the in crowd to be popular, and you don't have to be popular to be cat like.;
, If you are blessed with a pool there are pool toys that run around the bottom so you can enjoy the eye, stalk, chase, pounce, kill rush. Or, if you're cursed with flies in your house, hunt them down and pounce with the wrath of your fly swatter in hand; it truly is more fun than it should be. You can even take small stuffed animals and have somebody hide them around the house and hunt for them that way. Allow yourself to think ""I am fierce. I am the tigress!"" Find a way to enjoy the instinct to kill and catch.

, Cats spend many hours a day grooming themselves so they look as stunning as they can. So take pride in your appearance and care for it: Steam your face over hot water (lean over a sink full of hot water and drape a towel over your head for a sauna effect), wash it with a cleanser for your skin type, then pat dry and apply lotion twice a day. Brush your teeth, clean your tongue, floss, and rinse with minty mouthwash after every meal and before bed. Brush and style your hair every morning. Pumice down your heels, and lotion your entire body twice daily. Always have a clean shave, dandruff free hair, deodorant on, and clean your ears. Shave your legs and armpits, wash your hair every other day, apply conditioner daily, apply a nice perfume, and take a (quick) shower every morning.

, Use a strengthening nail polish base coat and raise your calcium intake. Paint them a nude, light pink or brown and add french tips for good measure. Make sure they are always clean and file them when necessary. Grow them long like claws but not so long you can't hold a pencil normally. If you are cursed with short nails, you can be a de-clawed cat.

, (If you didn't catch that joke: female cats are called queens.)Wake up each morning with yoga (cats usually stretch when they wake up!) using some good yoga DVDs that increase flexibility, beauty, and energy. Do yoga for 20 minutes. Then follow it up with a 15 minute morning jog. Learn to breathe deeply without panting like a dog while you jog, but don't overdo it. The yoga should help with this. Also, when you jog step very lightly, as you should not be heard. It will take some practice. Once you come home drink plenty of water and enjoy a lean breakfast. ABSOLUTELY NO: white bread toast (breaks down into sugars too easily), bacon (too fatty, not enough protein), bagels (high calorie carbs, bloating, especially with cream cheese!), or breakfast sandwiches (crap stacked between white bread! NO!). Instead have an omelet with a small amount of low fat cheese and maybe some light yogurt or fruit. (Excellent source of protein and calcium!) Then groom yourself for the day.

, Cats eat lots of meat and fish, so try to have some with every meal. Also, they eat vegetables that are in their cat food, so eat those too. Cats love milk. But, you also need some fruits and vegetables. Cats don't naturally eat wheat so stay away from it as much as you can. Make sure to have some of each food group in every meal you eat. Eat 3 meals and 1 snack daily. Never eat too much and never eat too little.

, Take ballet classes a few to several times a week, take pilates, do yoga, run track, archery, fencing, hunting, dancing, martial arts, or just go to the gym! Make sure to do at least two of these activities, but you can do others. You need to learn at least some moves in martial arts, the basics of fencing, running fast, doing yoga and pilates at home with DVDs, some basic dance moves, and exercise daily.

, Some think cats show no emotions but you can tell their emotion by their body language and the tone in their meow some say their cats meows differently when they want food than they do when they want to play or go outside. Express your emotions through tone of voice and body language.

, If you hide something from a cat and it doesn't know about it it's quite easy to stop it from getting it. If a cat figures out it likes something and decides to get it, It's almost impossible. They are NOT lazy! They will work for what they want! So find the dream and live it!

, Stretch, flop over, and relax anywhere you like. Even fall asleep. But, don't fall asleep at school. Cats are extremely smart and would get straight A's.

Start by having a friend wear the jacket on backwards.,
Cut the arms off at whatever length you think would look good, or don't cut them off at all.,Take the thin nylon chord and put it on the edge of the duct tape in the middle of the strip on the sticky side so that you have a strip of duct tape that has rope running through the middle of it

,
Keep unrolling the tape and sticking the rope till you have a nice size strip.,
Cut the rope and strip off here and apply more strips to the edges above the strip you applied, until the entire jacket is covered in duct tape with rope in it.

,
You will see a ribbed effect develop on the jacket.,
Now for the hard part: heat up your hot glue gun.,
Glue the edge of the space blanket to the bottom edge of the jacket.

,
Slowly put a bit of hot glue near the edge of the glued space blanket and smear it around with the blanket until the glue is everywhere and you can put the space blanket tightly down against the jacket.,
Do this for the whole jacket, letting it dry between applications of glue.,
Cut a piece from the second space blanket that will fit the upper front chest and glue it on following the same procedure as the lower space blanket.,
If you left some sleeves on the jacket, glue some space blanket all around the sleeves, ribbed or not ribbed.

,
Now for the mirror.,
Glue some Velcro onto the edges behind the mirror, and then glue some Velcro on the jacket near the center of the chest so that you could just velcro the mirror over the center of your chest.

,
Now with electrical tape, write on the bottom of the front of the jacket ""Ray-Gun-Proof Vest"".

,
Finished.

",How to Make a Ray Gun Proof Vest," Stuff his shirt full of pillows, so that the jacket isn't loose or folded. Zip up the back of the jacket.;
, Somewhere near the elbow.

,, Stick the first end to the edge where the zipper is at the bottom of the jacket. Roll it around the edge of the jacket until you get to the other edge of the zipper in the back

,, This is good, and looks really cool. Duct tape the arms if you want with the same ribbing effect.

, Take the space blanket and stretch it around the jacket. Figure out which position lets it cover the most amount of jacket. The optimal position will let the blanket go around the whole jacket and a little past the zipper. It's okay if the top of the jacket isn't covered. If the space blanket is big enough, bring it up to the armpits.

,, This causes the space blanket to tightly conform to the shape of the jacket so now the jacket is very shiny.

, For the part that overlaps the zipper, do not glue it. Rather, put a strip of duct tape on the back and hot glue some Velcro patches to the edge of the overlap and the edge of the zipper so you can velcro this overlap over the zipper.

, Do the same for the back piece.

,, Start by breaking the plastic casing off the edges of the mirror with a flat-headed screwdriver.

Let's start with your character's weight.,
Never be any taller than 5'6.,
Don't forget curves.,
You skin should be naturally perfect.,

You don't need to spend time mastering anything.,

",How to Be a Mary Sue," She simply must have 0% body fat. In fact, they don't weigh anymore than 120 pounds. Of course, no matter how thin you are, remember you're always super strong. What's that you say? Muscles have mass too and bulge out? Not in a Sue they don't!;
, Because you won't be 'cute' or petite if you are. Only ugly girls are really tall. Boys however MUST to be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) tall and mysteriously strong even without obvious muscles!

, Feel free to mention your hourglass figure or perfect abs in almost every post. It reminds everyone of just how naturally, perfectly handsome or beautiful your character is.

, Only regular people actually need to use make-up. Your character should only wear it to accent their already lovely skin or flawless abs. Caked on eyeliner and ten pounds of makeup is acceptable. No one will say you look like a raccoon, and if they do, then they're just jealous of your character's absolutely perfect looks.

, Ignore it completely, and feel free to do things that are absolutely impossible in real life and defy the laws of universe. Speaking of which...when it comes to Mary Sues, obeying laws is for losers too.

, If you need a personality, just make up a generic one or steal it off of another character. Better yet, observe a board, watch the male character you find ""cool"", ask to join, then totally rip off his persona. Guys totally dig female versions of themselves. Just make sure to be better than him at everything he does. Even if it's his job and he spent years mastering his skills.

, Or a katana. Because anyone who uses logical weapons like guns is just a twit. A katana can cut through a tank and slice the moon in half! Seriously!

Friar robe’s offer hoods, which make them a good option to replicate a Jedi robe.
The robe should reach to the floor or your ankles at the very least.
Stick with simple and comfortable robes.

, Don’t wear an expensive, flashy belt. Remember that the Jedi are very ascetic. That’s what you should be striving to emulate., Remember to keep the colors and tones of the boots and pants very muted. You shouldn't be wearing conspicuous or extravagant clothing, and the pants shouldn't be so baggy that they fall below your waist.


The material should be tough enough to withstand survival missions or work outdoors. There is no such thing as designer Jedi clothing., Wearing multiple layers of tunics is an ideal way to replicate the Jedi look. The under tunic should be white and the over tunic should match the color of your trousers.Remember that Padawans also only wore simple robes and tunics.

, The Jedi code should inform the way that you interact with the world and how you think about yourself. The Jedi code is a good mantra to memorize and try to recall on your path to becoming a Jedi. Try to remember the code whenever you get frustrated or worked up. The Jedi code is as follows:


There is no emotion, there is peace.
There is no ignorance, there is knowledge.
There is no chaos, there is harmony.
There is no passion, there is serenity.
There is no death, there is the Force.

, Fear is the path to the dark side, so you should try to avoid letting fear consume you. It’s totally okay to fear so long as you admit it to a master or an apprentice, or any one with you. If no-one is with you admit it to yourself out-loud, it is better to be mindful of being afraid than to contain it inside you. 

, To hone your full potential abilities as a Jedi you must be morally, ethically, and mentally stable.Patience is a huge part of being a Jedi. You shouldn’t find yourself riled up easily or constantly worried. Have faith in your abilities to handle extreme situations.

, The three pillars of the Jedi Path are self-discipline, knowledge, and the Force. Remember that the Force doesn’t necessarily need mean moving around objects with your mind.

, Mindfulness meditation is an easy meditation to begin with. This will help you have a relaxed and capable mind. The idea behind mindfulness meditation is that your brain is constantly thinking and planning but never taking the time to be present.

When you notice that your attention has strayed from your breathing, move it back to your breath.

Being able to construct acceptable characters is an important key to mastering the art of roleplaying.,
Once you have written out your character’s profile, look over it again to see if you wish to make any changes to it.,
Finally, get to know your character.",How to Be a Professional Roleplayer2," Having poor characters will more than often annoy other roleplayers and stop you from moving onto to advanced roleplays. In order to have an acceptable, excellent character, your character’s profile should contain the following in it:

Name - You should create a first and last name for your character. Try to be creative with it.






Age – The age of your character will depend on the roleplay (ex: a roleplay about teenagers would require your character to be 13 to 18 years old).
Gender – You will have either a male or female character, unless if specified.
Appearance – This is one of the important parts of your character, as this will influence the opinion of other roleplayers. You should include your character’s height, eye color, hair color, skin tone, etc. that describe your character’s appearance.
Personality – This is another important part of your character. Your character’s personality will decide whether he/she gets through the roleplay alive, wins another character’s heart, and other important events. Your character’s personality will also influence his/her decisions. It will also give other roleplayers an idea of what your character is like. Don’t forget to mix in a few flaws – no character is perfect! Without the personality, your character literally has no life to live for.
Your character’s profile must also consist of other information that the roleplay requires. Skipping those requirements may result in your character not being accepted into the roleplay.

, Be sure you have included enough flaws so your character will not be considered a Mary/Marty Sue. A Mary/Marty Sue is a flawless character with both an excellent personality and appearance. Mary/Marty Sues tend to be annoying and will always say or do the right thing.


Having a Mary or Marty Sue may get you kicked out of the roleplay! Plus, if you have a past of creating Mary or Marty Sues, advanced roleplays or another other roleplays may refuse to admit you in.

, Knowing what your character would do or say in a situation will help develop your skills in roleplaying. If you enter a roleplay without getting to know your character at all, you will have problems with writing!

"
"
You will need to be able to write multiple paragraphs.,
Come up with interesting dialog.,
Avoid using “he” or “she” at the start of every sentence.,
Attend conventions.,
Read other roleplayer’s posts.,
Interact with other characters.,
Try to become one of the lead characters; it may give you some attention from professionals and it will help your reputation!",How to Be a Professional Roleplayer3," More advanced roleplays will not accept one-liners (posts that consist of only one line) and they will expect a lot of writing from you. If you dislike writing, advanced roleplays are not for you. Your paragraphs should also consist of good quality and excellent vocabulary that everyone will understand. In fact, it is better to have a few sentences that ooze of excellent quality, than a few paragraphs that make other roleplayers want to scream!


Make your posts longer and more interesting to read with descriptions, dialogue, word choice, and correct conventions.
If are able to, describe everything from your character’s view. If your character meets another character, describe it. If your character enters a building, describe it. If your character eats something, describe its taste. Your description should consist of strong words that make the reader want to continue – anything to make your post longer and more interesting to read!

, People don’t want to just read a whole bunch of descriptions! If your character bumps into someone, apologize. If your character walks into a restaurant, don’t just simply write that your character ordered some food – have your character ask for the food himself/herself! For bonus, add some extra sentences that reflects your character’s personality (for example: “Milkshake, please,” Ginger sniffed, her manicured fingernails impatiently tapping on the counter. The air circling around her reeked of her designer perfume, causing some customers to cover their noses.).

, Have a variety of other words to depict the scene in the roleplay. Refrain from repeating words in your posts, especially in sentences. If you find that you have trouble with thinking of different words, try using a thesaurus.

, Grammar, punctuation, and spelling are extremely important in roleplays – you cannot stress that enough! If you have many misspelled words, run-on sentences, and grammar problems in your posts, you will get kicked out of any roleplay you attempt to join. Mistakes happen to the best of us, but you've got to check over every word, run your post through Microsoft Word – whatever it takes to minimize your mistakes.


If your sentence looks too long, add a comma. If it looks like it has too many commas, add a period in there.

, Reading is a huge part of roleplaying! If you avoid reading other people’s posts, you won’t know what is going on in the roleplay! In order to have excellent posts that qualify for advanced roleplayers, you’ll need to read to know what is appropriate and not appropriate to put in your post.

, If your character does a solo act and refuse to speak to any other characters, you will most likely be left behind while the others travel onto the action! If you do interact with other characters, you will most likely be included in all the action.

, Although this role will take some time to work for, if you make enough excellent posts, your character will most likely be the star! However, refrain from shoving others out of the way in order to receive the spotlight, or your character will become unpopular. Don’t make your character do too many kind acts either, or you will be labeled as a Mary or Marty Sue!

Be a princess every day.",How to Dress Up as a Princess," There are dozens of wonderful characters to choose, from Cinderella (the most famous of them all) to Jasmine to Belle. Figure out which one you relate to most or simply like the best, and plan to dress up like her.


If you feel like a more classic princess approach, go with Cinderella or Sleeping Beauty's Aurora. They share that timeless princess style that includes elegant ball gowns and perfectly coiffed hair.
Princess Tiana is a Disney character with a hardworking attitude, ambition and a sassy southern personality. She wears a pale green and yellow nature-inspired gown.
Belle has a bookish personality and a gorgeous yellow gown.
Snow White's blue, red and yellow dress can be found in any costume shop.;
, Merida is the fiery red head from the movie Brave. While she doesn’t take any flack from her family, she’s still sweet and lovable. Consider this princess if you're a bit of a rebel.


Merida wears a floor length, long-sleeved blue dress with white lace embellishments around the collar and elbows, as well as a thin brown belt and matching boots.
Start working on your Scottish accent now to go along with your costume.

, Some may forget Princess Fiona's character as she's not the conventional beauty, but she's incredible. She's the leading character in one of the most popular modern-day fairy-tales, Shrek. Her story has a twist though, as Princess Fiona Lillian is cursed to live as an ogress. While she may be waiting on her prince, she's not afraid to throw a few punches of her own and take charge.


Fiona wore a velvet, long, long-sleeved dress with a gold belt and flats.
If you are really committed to the character, think about all the fun you'll have painting yourself green!

, Though she has an itty-bitty frame, this fairy-tale princess has a huge heart. You may remember that this character wasn't a princess by birth, but she became one when she married Cornelius, the prince of fairies.


Her look featured a tri-colored, floor length dress. The top third was white with cap sleeves, while the bottom was light blue and the wide sash was teal.
Fairy wings would really make this costume stand out.

, Dressing like this magnificent character from The Swan Princess would allow you to wear two costumes instead of one. Remember, the golden haired princess, has the capability to turn into a swan during the day and return to her human form at night. She's brave and speaks her mind but with a gentle touch.


Her main outfit was an all-white dress with bright green accents around the neck and shoulders. The puffy sleeves were gathered in sections with matching green ribbon and belt which hung to the floor.

, The headstrong leader from Antz is somewhat strict and stern but it all comes from a good place. This princess is tough and willing to protect her ant hill at all costs.


For this look, you can get away with wearing an all brown dress or brown shirt and pants.
This option is a good choice for the dancer in you, as Bala loves to boogie.

, Princesses aren’t just limited to the big screen in an animated feature, of course! There are plenty of real-life princesses with amazing style to choose from. Here are just a few:


Kate Middleton is real-life royalty based in the United Kingdom who has stolen hearts by marrying Prince William. She exudes grace and poise.She prides herself on being a real woman with accessible style. Try wearing a knee-length lace wrap dress, which is a go-to of hers.
Princess Charlene, the princess of Monaco, became royalty after marrying Prince Albert II. She's been photographed wearing everything from long gowns to pants suits to a fitted dress.
Princess Stéphanie is the wife of Guillaume, Hereditary Grand Duke of Luxembourg. She is a member of one of the oldest royal families in Europe. To dress like her, you'll need bright colors and short kitten heels., Nearly every princess, real or fictional, has dazzled her court in a ball gown. This is possibly the most princess-like garment you can throw on. Depending on the princess of your choice, choose the dress accordingly.


Cinderella wore a blue ball gown, matching headband and iconic glass slippers.
Belle wore a sunshine yellow gown with matching ribbon in her hair and bright red lips.You may be able to find something at a costume store or a second-hand shop that fits the bill.
Consider making your own costume so you can also add a little personalization.

, Princesses can't wear ball gowns every day, but even their casual clothes have an elegant touch. For example, Princess Jasmine didn’t wear a ball gown, but that didn’t make her any less royal. Her look consisted of sky blue silk pants and belly-baring top.


If you can’t track down what you’re looking for, think a little outside the box by wearing similar items. For example if you do like Jasmine, wear a light blue dress, matching flats and chunky gold jewelry.If you prefer Ariel, put on some green pants, a purple top and seashell jewelry.
Kate Middleton dresses casually all the time but makes it chic. She's been seen wearing a fitted pair of jeans and three-quarter length sleeve top multiple times., These small, extra additions will really make your costume stand out and become more believable. For example, how will everyone know you’re a princess unless you wear a tiara or crown? The sparkly head piece creates an instant regal effect and people will begin to bow in your presence.


Adding gloves and a wand will only add to your look. Find these items to complement the ensemble.
Find the perfect pair of shoes like Cinderella's glass slippers or Snow White's black patent leather shoes.
If you're dressing as Merida, you'll definitely need a bow and arrow.
Going as Princess Bala will require a cute antenna headband.
Remember to add tiny green ears to your costume if dressing as Princess Fiona.
Princess Stéphanie loves to rock a big hat. They always match her ensemble perfectly and add flair to her look.

, Not every princess wears a ton of make-up. This is especially true for real princesses like Kate Middleton. Look at various pictures of the royal figure and consider which one will work best for you.Princess Charlene is also rarely seen wearing a lot of makeup. Evening events is the only exception to this. Then, she has soft eyes and cheeks with a bright red lipstick.
For a more general princess-like makeup look, go with rosy cheeks, bright eyes and soft pink lips.Paint your face green for an authentic Princess Fiona look.
Add stunning, long lashes to enhance a Princess Jasmine costume.
Princess Merida rocked soft, naturally looking makeup and peach lips.

, It will only take a few minutes to recreate some of the iconic dos. For example, Elsa from Frozen simply wears her hair in a loose French braid. Belle, on the other hand, sections her hair in two parts. She’s pictured with a high, loose bun tied with a gold ribbon and the remaining strands drape over her shoulder.


Princess Rapunzel has extremely long locks. To steal her style, add blonde extensions.
Princess Leia from the movie Star Wars, has one of the most memorable hairstyles of all. With a center part, she created to two ponytails on both sides of her head. Then, she wound each one to form giant buns. This is a must for this character.Recreate Snow White's soft curls using a curling iron or rollers. Have two big, loose waves towards the front to frame your face. The rest should flow towards the back and be tight to make a curly bob of sorts. Add a red headband to finish it off.
If simplicity is what you’re after, try the Pocahontas hair style. She has a natural look with a center part and straight strands.
Steal Princess Charlene's short, sophisticated pixie that shows off her long neck.

, By doing this, all your friends can dress up as their favorite princess too. It will be a ton of fun to see all the ideas everyone came up with and how they executed their vision.


Even the guys can get in on the action. Encourage them to show up in their best prince costume.

, Why dress up like a ghost or vampire when you can be a princess for a day? Stores will have plenty of options during this time of year. You’ll undoubtedly be able to find everything you need.


Because this is the dressing up season, think about looking for wigs to really put your costume over the top. Find a bright red wig like Princess Merida and add loose waves to reproduce her style.

, With all eyes on you, head down the aisle in the most magnificent gown you can find. You can even arrive in a horse-drawn carriage and have a castle-shaped ice sculpture for the full effect.


Copy Princess Diana's infamous ball gown wedding dress when she married Prince William. The full skirt, outrageously long train and floor length veil still makes headlines.
No princess would be caught without her jewels. Find sparkly bracelets and earrings that will enhance your joyful glow.

, Whether your school’s theme is “A Time to Remember” or “Under the Sea,” a princess-style dress will make a huge impression on your friends., No need to search for an excuse to dress up like a pretty princess. Kate’s everyday looks can be stolen easily. Choose modest outfits that are well-tailored to fit you like a glove. Carry a small clutch and wear your hair down. Choose items in the same color scheme as some of the characters you want to mimic.

,  Mangle wears a red bowtie. It is important because you may not look exactly like Mangle, but you need to accessorize. If you don't accessorize you are just going to look like some weird kid in a tu-tu and overdone makeup. The bowtie makes it look like you are wearing a costume.

Gently rub your cheek and neck against furniture or your friend to act like a cat showing what’s theirs., When cats find a soft place to lay down, they repetitively push down with their paws making it look like they’re kneading bread. Find a blanket to use, and with your hands in a fist gently do a kneading motion on the blanket before laying down., Cats are very playful animals. Two ways they like to play are batting at feathers or toys and pouncing on small rodent looking toys. Mimic this playful behavior with stuffed animals or balls in your house., Cats are often seen as standoffish and independent. Embrace your inner feline by carrying yourself with an air of indifference. Flip your hair in arrogance as you walk away from people.

, Everyone wants to look up to a writer... they're those people you admire for their style, charisma, attitude, and ability.

, A good writer is a mixture of people-person and solitude seeker. People-watching is key to your craft, while finding time alone is essential for writing uninterrupted and unimpeded by other's opinions and views. Find a good balance between being around people and being in solitude.

, Most writers brainstorm by jotting things down such as what they see, hear, feel and think, and look for inspiration everywhere. Everything is inspiration to a writer. Even wear a pencil behind your ear.

, Show your passion for what you write about.

Roses, chintz, and other small floral prints are some of your best options. Large floral print and many geometric prints can work, too, but keep in mind that the pattern should look old fashioned.
Stay away from bold, bright colors. Opt for neutrals, dull hues, or pastel shades.
The shape of the dress or skirt is also important. Straight, breezy ""muumuu"" styles are ideal, but boxy cuts will also work. Avoid form fitting clothing.;
, If you opted for a skirt instead of a full dress, you'll need a blouse to complete the basic outfit. Try to find a long-sleeve button-down blouse in white or a light pastel shade.


As with dresses and skirts, the cut of the blouse should be boxy and straight rather than being fitted.

, A 100 year old woman is more sensitive to the cold than her younger counterparts would be. Drape a shawl over your shoulders or slip on a plain button-down cardigan sweater.


If you opt for a shawl, look for one made of knitted wool or soft cotton. Lace designs, floral prints, and plain colors will all work. Drape the shawl over your shoulders and tie or pin it in place at the front of your body.If you go with the sweater option, wear the sweater instead of draping it over your shoulders. Choose a simple, straight-cut silhouette and stick with drab, solid colors.

, Think about the type of shoe a 100 year old foot would feel comfortable in. Plain white sneakers are a good choice, but supportive loafers could work, too.


The sneakers should be as plain and simple as possible. Canvas sneakers are better than athletic walking shoes.
Similarly, any loafers you wear should be simple. Dark brown or black options are best.

, Skip the socks. Instead, slip on a pair of plain knee-high or waist-high nylon stockings.


The stockings should be plain. Avoid textured leggings or stockings with prints on them.
Color choice makes a difference here, as well. Your best options are flesh, ivory, and white. Avoid black nylons and ones that come in unconventional colors (blue, red, etc.).

, Opt for a large brooch, necklace, or pair of earrings. Choose a piece with classic colors and metals and avoid trendy statement jewelry.


Large pearls and large solid-color beads work well. For instance, a short strand of pearls or beads is a great necklace choice, and large single pearl earrings make a good option for your ears.
Classic metals are other good options. Gold often has a more antiqued look than silver, but a dull silver piece can work, as well. Avoid ""trendy"" metals like gunmetal silver or rose gold.

, These accessories are not strictly necessary, but certain hat styles are more commonly worn by 100 year olds and other elderly woman. You could also tie a simple kerchief over your hair if you cannot find the right sort of hat.


When picking out a hat, look for styles that were common to earlier eras. For a 100 year old woman, consider styles that would have been popular in the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, when she would have been young and in the prime of her life.
Kerchiefs or headscarves tend to have an “old country” appearance. Tie the headscarf so that it covers the top of your head and knots beneath your chin or at the back of your head. Avoid bandana styles. Instead, look for plain off-white kerchiefs or scarves with traditional floral prints.

, Since eyesight often deteriorates with age, many 100 year old women will sport a pair of glasses. Look for simple round or rectangular frames. Cat-eyed frames could work, as well.


If you do not have glasses of your own, consider buying a pair of reading glasses from a cheap dollar store or all-purpose store. These lenses are usually nothing more than magnifiers, but if they bother your eyes, you can simply pop the lenses out and wear the frames.
You could also look for an old pair of glasses from a thrift store or other secondhand shop.

, A small pocketbook sized handbag is better than a large one. Purses with handles are also a better option than those with a long shoulder strap.


Tuck the handle of the purse into the crook of your elbow and carry it around that way.
As with most aspects of this costume, simpler is better. Solid colors are preferable to prints and patterns.

, Push around a walker if you can find one. If not, look for a simple walking cane and hobble around with that.

, If your hair is long enough, tie it back in a simple bun at the base of your neck or the back of your head.


If you have difficulty with a traditional bun, you can make a loose one with nothing but an elastic ponytail holder. Tie your hair back with the ponytail holder. On the final wrap-around, do not pull your ponytail all the way through; instead, pull the hair through the elastic band just enough to create a bump or bun at the top. To keep the ends secure, wrap a second elastic band around the first.

, If your hair is too short to put in a bun, consider adding tight curls using hair rollers.


If you don't have rollers, consider using bobby pins to create tight pin curls, instead.
The main idea is simply to create tight curls that frame the face or otherwise stop above the shoulder. Loose, flowing curls would not work as well.
Alternatively, you could leave the curlers in your hair. This will create a much more casual, “at home” look. Make sure that the curlers are secure, though, so that they won't accidentally fall out as the day passes.

, A simple trick for making hair look grayer is to dust it with a little white powder, like baby powder or flour. Less is more, though. You want the hair color to look faded, but you don't want the powder to be especially noticeable.


Evenly sprinkle the powder over your head. It is best to sift it out, rather than applying it with your hands.
Once it's on there, shake your hair to break up any clumps and help spread the powder throughout. You may even wish to run a comb through your hair to help spread the powder.
Spray a little hairspray over the hair after applying the powder to help prevent the powder from falling out.
When done, both baby powder and flour should wash out of your hair with enough water and shampoo. Baby powder might be easier to strip from your locks than flour would be.

, You can usually find an old woman's wig at any store that sells costume supplies.

, Lightly apply a cool-tone foundation to your face to give it an aged, yellowed look.Use a pale cool-tone foundation, even if your skin is naturally warm-toned. Regular foundation will work, but it might be easier for you to find a foundation with a strong yellow undertone if you use costume makeup.
Apply the foundation evenly over the exposed skin of your face and neck. Use a sponge or brush to do this.
When finished, the color of your skin should be paler than normal, but it should still look like it could be natural human skin.

, Look for any light wrinkles that form on your natural face when you smile or frown. Trace these wrinkles in brown eyeliner, then smudge the eyeliner to blend it into your skin.


Smile, frown, or other scrunch your face up to produce a natural set of creases. Even young skin creases when the face contorts in different ways. As a person ages, these creases are what develop into wrinkles.
Lightly trace over the wrinkles around your eyes and mouth using brown eyeliner pencil. Avoid gel liners.
Use an eyeliner pencil close to your natural skin tone and lightly highlight around the edges of each brown mark.
Blend the two liner colors together using a makeup sponge. Doing so will make your creases look more like wrinkles without making the eyeliner marks too obvious.

, Dust the apples of your cheeks with a moderate amount of pink blush or rouge. The idea is to make it somewhat obvious that you're wearing make-up instead of making it look as natural as possible.


Consider using a cream rouge instead of a powdered one. Either option will work, but creams tend to have a more pronounced look.

, Choose a matte lipstick in a classic shade. Avoid glittery lipsticks or shiny lip glosses.


Don't be afraid to choose an option that is a little bolder than your normal preferences. A deep pink or solid red could work well. Avoid hot pinks and fire engine reds, though, since these might be a little too flashy.
Lips tend to thin out with age, too, so you could consider applying a beige lip liner to the outer perimeter of your top and bottom lip before putting on your lipstick to create the appearance of thinner lips.

You can use glue instead of tape if you don’t have clear tape.Use a headband that matches your hair color so that it blends in when you wear your costume.;
, Draw two equilateral triangles on your construction paper. 3 inch sides are a good size for these cat ears. After drawing your triangle, add ½” to the bottom. This will make it so you can wrap the bottom of the ears around your headband.







, Use your scissors to cut your cat ears out. Line them up together to make sure that they’re equal sizes. Once you get them to be equal sizes, fold a crease along the bottom ½” up.








, Place your headband in the crease of your cat ears so that it sits flat. If you’re using tape, simply fold the ears around your headband and tape around them. If you’re gluing them, glue along the crease of your ears on the inside of your headband.








Hot glue will hold best for your cat ears. However, if you’re using a plastic headband be careful not to burn through the plastic.

, If you glued your ears, give them more than enough time to set. If you’ve taped them, you’re ready to wear them! If you want to add something more to your ears, try cutting out white paper in a 1.5” equilateral triangle. Tape or glue this into the center of your ears.

Paint the rims of the eyes black to cover any remnants of hot glue if you want.",How to Make a Cheshire Cat Costume Head (Tim Burton Style)," Instead of continuously checking to see if the mask will fit on your head, you can just use the mannequin to check. If the cat head will slide over the mannequin head, it should do the same to yours.

It's best to check at least once or twice when making the head in case the mannequin head got squished somehow.;
, This should lift freely over the mannequin head. If you want the head to narrow closer to your neck, the base can be smaller but you will have to add a zipper or flap to get the head on.

, To do this, you can make another aluminium foil impression of your head, just the front this time, and use it to make a papier-mâché mask. Mix PVA glue and water in a two:one ratio, and brush it on tissue paper. Once dried, this mask is stronger than the alfoil, and provides an anchor for the cat head to stay fast on yours. The mask should not go past your nose, you want to breathe.





, You don't need it once the mask is dry, and it will be uncomfortable if left there.,, Not so tight it hurts, but tight enough so that when you run around in the mask it won't slip down or sideways on your head. You can use two straps, one to go over my ears around the head like goggles, and another under your chin, just to secure the mask further.

, The papier-mâché, with the weight of the full head, might irritate you. The foam will make it more comfortable.

, A wrapped up pillow may be more stable than the light alfoil, but if you use a pillow, the mask was slightly larger than it needed to be. Stuffing the alfoil head so it is stable might be a better idea.





, You need a frame to start shaping the head, and newspaper is more readily available/cheaper than wire. Roll a sheet of newspaper on the diagonal and twist it into a tight 'rope'. Start the frame around the head ear to ear and forehead to this horizontal piece. Tape it together, or staple if you wish. Add as many more of these frames as you wish; verticals from the top to the cardboard base are good.

, Sticky tape is your friend. Then we start making the cat shape.

, It's good to have either reference photos or your own cat for this. You can draw a concept picture - or several - and use those to help. Start with a rectangle of folded newspaper for the nose. The nose is small in this mask to allow for sight through the tear ducts.





, Pieces of cardboard are better than paper. The tear ducts are large and unpainted as this area will be where you see through. If you can make eyes you can see through, the tear ducts can be smaller. The whole head could be smaller in fact, but to see out of the tear ducts the whole head must be large.





, Newspaper and sticky tape in bulk are necessary.





, No Cheshire cat is complete without a winning grin. Make it wide. In the film the Cheshire Cat's mouth opens almost 270 degrees.





, The ears are triangles of newspaper, with the ends of the triangle overlapping so they make a cross. This makes an uneven cone shape. Stick the cross end of the cone down on the head, directly above the eyes and facing just slightly outwards; also stick down the end of the cone. It’s okay if the ears are loose, they will be stuck in place by the papier-mâché.





, Again, use 2:1 PVA glue to water and tissue. You can wet the tissue and put it on, but placing it on and brushing the glue mix with a paint brush is likely easier. No need to keep it smooth; it'll be covered in fur.

, If you spray some expanding foam and let it dry, you can carve it very easily. You can use this for the nose and teeth. Use a picture or a cat or just go for it.





, If you can't find anything spherical, try melting some plastic bottles with a hairdryer over a bowl. If you've looked at a cat, or anyone, form the side you'll see this clear dome before the iris. This dome imitates that and gives the painted eyes shine., Once the papier-mâché of the mask dries, you can remove a lot of the newspaper framework. This will make it lighter. You may want to support the smile though, as the weight of half of the mask rests it while your working on it. You can use skewers for this.

, Use black fabric you can see through, but when viewed people can't see your eyes. Cut off the cardboard tear ducts from your painted cat eyes. With hot glue, stick the black fabric to the clear done over the eyes and to the mask.

Don't worry if the black fabric goes too far on the nose, it will be covered in fur. Make sure the fabric is as stretched as it can be, so you'll be able to see easier.

,, The same grey fake fur used for the costume is used on the head. You can use several scrap pieces if necessary, but whole pieces will make it look neater., Thin pink fabric is good, so you can get air through it and the hole for your neck.

, They don't have to be the same size. Having four larger ones for the incisors is good though. Hot glue them onto the fabric ""gum"" on the mouth.

, Lay down the pieces of fabric, hot glue, and cut if you need to neaten it up. Again, use bigger pieces for less ""seam"" lines between two bits of fur.






Prepare for a game of ""Tetris"" if you're making the head after the costume and trying to conserve the fur.

, Otherwise you have your cat head. You can just wear the head if you want, or you can make the full body suit.

Bobby pins are too skinny to work with, make sure to get some clips that are at least half an inch wide. You want to use flat clips, French clips, or an alligator clips.

, You need to cut both the cardboard and the fabric for your ears. You can make triangular or oval ears—depending on what look you want to go for. For triangle ears, cut two equilateral triangles out of your cardboard.








, Wrap your fabric around the cardboard pieces to give you the shape you need. Mark a line where you wish to cut—mark it on the inside of the fabric. Add ½” to this outline and cut your fabric.








, Take your fabric and glue it around your cardboard ears. It will look best if you wrap the fabric over the top and glue at the base of your ear.







,, On the bottom of the back of your ears, hot glue your clips. Glue the ears to the top side of the clip—the bottom side will be against your head when you wear them.

Around three to four square metres of cheap fabric (for the template)
Around three to four square metres of grey fur (you can use the off cuts for the head)
Needle and thread
Sewing machine (to speed things up)
Pen;
, If you look at a cat, their legs are different to ours, because they are digitigrades; their knees are high up at almost half their leg length. You can make your fur suit have this shape of leg by using foam as padding and sewing a different leg pattern. However, most people won't notice or will think it looks odd, so you may choose not to bother. It's also a couple of extra steps and makes the legs harder to sew.

, The method varies depending on what you decided in the last step:


If you're doing regular legs, lay the cheap fabric on the ground, two pieces. The pieces should be at least as long as from your feet to your neck. Lie down on the fabric and either draw your own outline or get someone to outline around you. Leave at least a couple of inches around you to allow for your width, unless your two dimensional. Don't bother drawing hands and feet, cut the outline off at your wrists/ankles/neck. Cutting it a little longer than your wrist and ankle lines allow some overlap to the gloves and feet if you don't plan on sewing the gloves and feet to the fur suit.

, Then lie on your side and outline your leg from the side. Then outside of this outline draw the digitigrade shape for your legs. You will end up stuffing this area to get the leg shape.

, You'll be sewing on the line, if it's right on the edge it might come out. But this is your draft suit, don't bother making it perfect.

, Don't sew where your head/feet/hands will go through. Now it's a onesie, and you need to get it on somehow, so you can put a split in the back to get it on. For the rough draft you don't need to put a zipper on this break; you can use string or you can just hold it together behind your back when your checking fittings.

, Check if some areas are too tight, loose, etc. If you skip the practice and make the suit with fur first, if you get it wrong you may have wasted your fur. Even fake fur is pretty expensive, so it's best to make a practice first.

, Make the adjustments as need. Such as if your template was tight around your hips you add a few more centimetres on the fur. The fur side should be on the inside, so when you turn it inside out the seams you sewed along are on the inside.

, Try it on just to check you got it right. Below is the template and the final.

, Make sure the seam is on the side of the fabric.

, Again, fur on the side when your sewing. Don't make the tail too long; you don't want to trip on it. Try to make the tail out of one piece of fabric folded for less seams. Make it pretty thick if your going for the chubby/fluffy Cheshire Cat look. Don't sew along the top bit and leave a few centimetres from the top when your sewing the sides.

, If you put it at your natural tailbone you will trip on it, so a couple of centimetres higher than this will make like easier.

, Now you have to turn the first top centimetre or so out - so you see the fur. Align the edge with the edge of the cut and pin it together. Do this fully around the tail. Now sew the tail to the suit.

, If when you turn the suit inside out the fur of the tail is on the inside you did it wrong. If you can't easily turn it inside out you've had the tail too thin.

, Do this for both hands. Make sure you outline it thickly. The outlined hand should have very, very chubby fingers.

, If you're sewing along the lines make sure to leave a few millimetres off your line. Not too much or you'll have gloves stuffed with the seams and may not be able to fit your hands in.

, If you want claws don't sew along the top of the fingers.

, You can use the same foam you used to make teeth for the claws and feet. Cut the foam into triangle claws shapes. This foam is especially good because you can easily stick your needle through it. If you use something else you could probably hot glue the claws on.


For claws; turn the point end in, and poke it through the unsewn end of the fingers.

, Do this for all claws. Now when you turn it fur-side out, the claws should point out.

, Make your paw shape. You can make your slippers to sit over a shoe in case there was something sharp to step on. Using an old shoe in the middle protects you feet if you end up stepping on something sharp, and if you glue the slipper to the shoe you won't miss the old shoe.

, Only the top side, leave the base un duct-taped. Put the shoe on some cheap fabric and drawn the outline of the paw. This will be the bottom of the slipper.

, The duct tape will now help you make a template to sew.

, Use these flat pieces as templates, and draw their shapes onto your fur.

, Then pin it together and sew it. It's easier to pin and sew small parts at a time. If you want to add claws, leave the end of the paws unsewn like you did with the gloves.

,, Now stuff the slipper with cotton or whatever you wish. Once it's stuffed it should hold its shape. You can sew or glue the slipper to the shoe if you don't want the slipper to fall off when you, for example, run a one-hundred metre race."

Fabric of your choice
Scrap paper
Marker
Masking tape
Sewing pins (straight and hooked)
Glue
Construction paper
Scissors
X-acto knife
Thread
Wire hanger;
, On your scrap paper, use a marker to sketch out the shapes of your ears. To make your cat ears three dimensional, you should have a base shape that is an oval with a triangle cut out. It should almost look like a Pacman shape. Once cut out, tape the straight sides (the opening of Pacman’s mouth) together to create a cone-shaped ear.


Experiment with different dimensions until you reach your desired ear size and shape.

, If you like the way the shape looks, transfer the pattern to your construction paper. Because the construction paper is stiffer, you will be able to use it countless times.


Feel free to label the inside of your ears as L and R so that you keep them straight.

, Instead of tracing all the way around, create a straight line across the bottom where the point of your Pacman mouth hits. This will make triangles. Trace about 2-3 cm around your outline and cut your shape out along this outline. The extra fabric will give you plenty to work with to make your ears.If you’re using faux fur, make sure the hair is going upwards toward the tip of your ears.

, If you want to use separate kinds of fabric for the front and back of your ears, take your second fabric and trace the outline of the first cutouts you made. If you wish to use the same fabric, simply re-trace your first cutouts onto your original fabric. Use your scissors to cut these out.

, When you do this, you want the inside of the fabric to be facing you. Straight pin around the original outline that you made. Sew along the straight pins around the sides of your ears. Leave the bottom unsewn.

, Now that you’ve sewn your ears, use your scissors to cut the excess fabric off of the outside. Flip your ears. Now that you’ve sewn the sides together, flip your ears inside out. (This will make them right side out).

, Put the cutouts into your ears through the bottom slit. Glue them into place, starting with a drop of glue at the top point of the ear and working it down to the bottom. Your Packman mouth should still be sticking out. It will look like two triangles coming out from the bottom of your ears.

, The two triangles of your cutout that are sticking out of the bottom of your ears should be folded toward the back of the ear. Take glue and place it on the underside of the right triangle. Fold the ear so that this triangle lays over the top of the other to form a cone. Hold in place while the glue dries.

, Your ears have structure and support, they just need to be attached. You can either pin them to a headband, or you can pin them straight into your hair. Simply place the ear where you want on your head and slide the pin so that it catches the construction paper structure of your ear as well as your hair. Two pins is all it will take to hold them in place.

, Your tail should go from your hip to the bottom of your knee. Cut a fabric strip this length by 4 inches wide. Fold the tail in half (lengthwise) and sew it shut. Also, sew the bottom shut up leave the top., Untwist and unfold your wire hanger. You want to cut it to be an extra 6 inches longer than the length of your tail.Wrap excess fabric (or cotton if you have it) around your wire. Be sure to begin by wrapping the tip so that the wire doesn’t poke through the end of the tail. Wrap it to the last 6 inches.

, Place your fabric wrapped wire into your tail. Bend the tail into the shape and curve that you wish. Bend the top part of your wire. You may want to use pliers. Bend it into a hook that will grasp onto your belt. Simply make a tight “J” shape for a good hold.


The tighter the “J” shape, the more support your tail will have to stand up.

, Have a friend help you. Once the tail is attached to your belt, put the belt on. Have a friend shape the tail for you once again to ensure the perfect style.

Go for a blue, white, red, and light brown color palate.,
Choose several key wardrobe pieces, like a striped shirt and a cotton skirt.,
Go for jeans or cotton pants.,
Dress nautical down or up with a few tweaks.,
Highlight one nautical element in your outfit.,
Accessorize, but don’t go overboard.",How to Dress Nautical Style1," The classic sailor suit is white with royal blue stripes. The idea is to take the color palate of the classic sailor suit and complement it with other hues like red and light brown.Adding not so nautical colors will help to mix up your outfits and keep your look from being a costume. You don’t want to look like you’re dressing for Halloween! Instead, think of nautical as a style you can customize to fit your wardrobe.;
, Start with basic pieces that you can then pair with other bottoms or tops.Look for a striped shirt with vertical stripes, rather than horizontal stripes. Horizontal stripes can make your torso look wider, rather than long and slim.
Don’t be afraid to go bold with your stripes. Make a statement with large or thick stripes on a shirt or a skirt.
Go for lightweight, breathable fabrics like cotton, jersey, and denim. You can wear nautical year round, though it may be more suited to warmer seasons like spring and summer., Jeans are a great way to integrate nautical style into your wardrobe, especially a dark navy skinny jean or a relaxed boyfriend jean.


You can also go for a pair of cropped navy pants or a pair of high waisted jean shorts to add some variety to your nautical look., If you’re dress your nautical style down for a casual day out, go for a striped shirt, jeans, and comfortable flats or sandals in light brown. You could also slip on a pair of tennis shoes or your favorite white Converses.For a more dressy night out, choose a dress with stripe details or a small anchor print. Or go for a pair of cotton pants and a striped blouse. Add white heels or wedges to the outfit to complete the dressy nautical look.
Another great way to add some nautical to your look is to wear a navy or white blazer with a striped shirt, jeans, and flats. For a night out, pair the blazer with a navy or striped dress and a pair of simple wedge heels.

, Keep only one element, like a shirt or skirt, nautical. Then, keep the other outfit elements simple so they complement the nautical piece.This could be as easy and effortless as pairing a striped blazer with a plain t shirt and jeans or with a collared white shirt and a pair of navy pants.
You can also add different textures to your outfit, like a white cashmere sweater instead of a blazer, or a ribbed sweater on top of a white collared shirt.

, Choose a striped purse with rope details or gold jewellery with anchors or sail boats, but don’t pile one too many accessories at once. The key is to highlight one main accessory and then keep any other accessories simple and minimal.


Look for a striped purse with brown leather details or rope details.Go for a bold statement necklace in gold with blue or white details. Look for a bracelet with anchors or little lobster charms. Or layer on two or three thin gold necklaces for a more subtle look.
Add a thin gold belt to a navy or striped dress to give your outfit a fun, chic element.
Make your outfit nautical with a cotton scarf in navy or in an anchor print.

Plan on making six tentacles.,
Choose colorful tights or long cotton socks.,
Stuff the tentacles.,
Slide a wire through each tentacle.,
Seal the stuffing in.,
Attach bottlecap suckers.,
Find a colorful top.,
Secure tentacles to the sides of the sweatshirt.,
Choose a cap.,
Make octopus eyes.,
Attach the eyes to the side of your head.,
Wear matching sweats, tights, or skirt.,
Cut strips of fake kelp.,
Make a comfortable backup costume (optional).",How to Make an Octopus Costume," You can save yourself a little effort by counting your arms as the seventh and eighth tentacles. Keep that in mind while gathering materials.;
, If you can only find white socks, paint them to match the rest of your costume. Purple, orange, red, or blue are all good options for an octopus.


If using tights, cut each leg into three sections, making six ""tentacles"" total. Close one end of each section using hot glue or needle and thread.

, You may use any compressible material, including cotton batting, newspaper, plastic bags, or tissue paper. Stuff each tentacle until it's firm enough to keep its shape.

, Cut a length of sturdy wire and slip it through the center of each tentacle. Glue it into place. Now you can adjust the pose of the tentacles by bending the wire.


You can disassemble wire coat hangers instead of purchasing a whole spool of wire.

, Sew the opening closed, or glue the edges together.

, Gather plastic bottle caps and paint them white if they aren't already. Glue three bottle caps in a line at the tip of each tentacle.

, Choose a sweatshirt or turtleneck the same color as your tentacles. You will be sewing the tentacles onto this, so pick an old one or buy one secondhand.


A hood makes it easy to attach the eyes, but it is not mandatory.

, Sew them on starting from the inside of the shirt, so the stitches don't show. Use sturdy thread that can support the tentacles' weight, and keep sewing until the tentacles are well secured. You'll want three tentacles on each side, below your arms.


Bend the wires on the tentacles to change their position.
For greater comfort, offset the tentacles a little forward, so your actual arms can hang at your side.

, If your sweatshirt doesn't have a hood, find a knit hat close to the same color as your shirt. If you can't find one and have extra tights fabric left over from earlier, you can glue or stitch the edges together to make a cap.

, To mimic the bulging eyes of an octopus, cut a ping pong ball in half. Draw a rectangular pupil onto each half using a permanent marker or black paint.


Googly eyes are another option.

, Glue the eyes onto the hood or cap of your costume. Place them as symmetrically as you can, with the pupils in the same position.

, If you can, make your whole costume the same color.

, A black plastic garbage bag makes convincing seaweed when cut into strips. Drape it over your tentacles or stick it in your belt to hang around you.

, If you like, cut a secondhand skirt into eight pointed strips to further mimic tentacles. This is a less striking but more comfortable costume you can change into if the larger tentacles start to annoy you.

Go to the library and peruse books on butterflies.,
Download the template featured on Martha Stewart's website.,
Cut out the template.,
Choose your materials.,
Measure your child's frame.,
Mark the height and width on the cardboard or felt.,
Cut out your wings.,
Decorate your wings.,
Assemble your wings.,
Attach the straps.,
Make your antennae.,
Have your child dress up in a matching color as the main color of the wings.",How to Make Butterfly Costumes for Toddlers," Allow your toddler to choose the butterfly they would most want to look like. You can also adjust a butterfly design for their favorite color, making a blue, pink or purple butterfly costume.
, Go to images.marthastewart.com/images/content/web/pdfs/2010Q4/sip_hall10_mademoisellebutterfly.pdf and print off the pages., Align the pages on your craft table in order, according to the diagram., You have 2 choices in making your butterfly costume. You can create felt and foam wings by sewing or create cellophane and cardboard wings if you are good at paper craft.

If you choose to sew a felt butterfly costume, you will need 1 yard (0.9 m) of polyurethane foam, 1.5 yards (1.4 m) of dark felt, colored felt pieces, elastic and a needle and thread. The colored felt pieces should match your chosen butterfly design.
If you choose to glue a cardboard butterfly costume, you will need 2 pieces of corrugated cardboard, cellophane and tempera paints. Your paints and cellophane should match your chosen butterfly design.

, Take 1 measurement from your child's hips to the top of their head. Take the second measurement from 1 side of your child's shoulders to the other side.

Add 8 inches (20.3 cm) to the horizontal measurement, so that the wingspan extends beyond their shoulders.

, Trace the paper onto the cardboard or felt, adjusting for the measurements you have just made. You may need the wings to be larger or smaller than the template, depending upon your child's size., Follow the first instructions for the cardboard project and the second for the felt project.

Trace the decorative pattern onto 1 piece of cardboard. You can do this by pressing a pencil around the image on the template to score the cardboard on each side, or you can approximate the shapes. Cut the shapes out using a utility knife. Trace the patterns onto the other piece of cardboard through the shapes in the first piece. Cut out the shapes in the second piece of cardboard with a utility knife.
Fold your large piece of dark felt in half. Align the edge of the template with the fold. Trace around the shape with a fabric pen. Cut out the shape of the wings by cutting through both layers of the folded felt. Take your remaining dark felt and fold it in half. Trace the design, but this time cut out the shape and cut down the folded middle. Fold your piece of foam, trace it and cut it without cutting down the fold. Cut another piece of foam, but this time, cut down the fold. This will form the 4 layers of the final project.

, Follow the first instructions for the cardboard project and the second for the felt project.

Paint 1 side of each of your cardboard pieces with a single color of tempera paint, that matches your butterfly colors. The other sides can remain unpainted because they will be laid together.
Cut out pieces of brightly colored felt. Use your template pieces as a guide to cut out the felt wing markings. You will need to cut out 2 sets of markings, 1 for each side of the back of the wings. Use a top stitch on your sewing machine or by hand to affix the colored pieces of felt to the large single felt piece.

, Follow the first instructions for the cardboard project and the second for the felt project.

Turn your painted cardboard over. Glue pieces of colored cellophane over the holes. Place strong glue around each hole and press the cellophane onto the glue. You may want to use many small cellophane pieces instead of 1 large piece, to ensure it is firmly attached. Place glue around the back side of the second piece of cardboard. Gently affix it over the cellophane, on the back of your first piece. Allow it to dry.
Stack your wing pieces to sew them. Place your large piece of foam on the bottom. Place the whole felt wing with the accent felt design face up. Place your half felt wings facedown. Then, place your half foam pieces on top of them. Sew around the perimeter of your wing stack, using a 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) seam allowance. Stitch around the entire perimeter. Turn the wings right side out through the center openings. Use a whipstitch to stitch the center of the wings closed on the underside.

, The straps can be attached across the body diagonally for both the felt and cardboard projects. Your child will step into the straps and you can pull the wings up to criss-cross the body.

Cut 2 11-inch elastic straps. Affix them diagonally across the inside body of the wings. Use a needle and thread on the sewing project and a large staple gun on the cardboard project.

, Buy a headband that matches the color of your wings. Tie 2 pipe cleaners on either side of the top of the band.

Curl the antennae into a spiral at the top.
You can also use a fold over beanie and duct tape the pipe cleaners under the fold. This is a good idea if it is a cold night.

, Choose warm tights, sweaters, a vest or a snowsuit in that color if the weather is very cold."

Focus on several key pieces in your nautical wardrobe.,
Go for outerwear with a nautical twist.,
Look for stylish boat shoes or loafers.,
Add touches of nautical to your accessories.",How to Dress Nautical Style2," These could be striped shirts, relaxed fit jeans, or seersucker pants or shorts.


Build off of these key pieces. Pair a striped shirt with jeans or white cotton pants. Or wear a plain white t-shirt with a pair of seersucker shorts.Look for shorts that fall just above your knees. They should fit snugly but not too tightly.
Bold stripes look great paired with a simple item like jeans or a pair of cotton shorts. So, don’t shy away from making a statement with stripes.
Go for lightweight fabrics like cotton or seersucker. But don’t be afraid to add in other colors to the standard navy and white nautical palate. Complementing hues like red, orange, brown, and gray can really add variety to your nautical look.

, You can easily add some nautical to your wardrobe with a key item like a blazer, a jacket or a coat.Pair a seersucker blazer with a pair of cotton shorts and a white t-shirt. Or dress up the blazer with a collared shirt and a pair of cotton pants.
Look for a smart sailing jacket in bright hues like royal blue, accented with red or brown. Make sure the jacket is slim fitting so it looks chic instead of frumpy. Roll up the sleeves to just below your elbow to style the look.
Go for a classic navy trench coat. A trench coat is a great investment piece, as it will look as good on the weekends with a striped shirt as it will during the week over a suit or more formal outfit. Don’t be afraid to add color with a pair of red cotton pants or a pair of striped running shoes.

, Boat shoes have a round toe, good traction, and are easy to slip on and off, perfect for the laid back nautical style. Brands like Tommy Hilfiger, Sperry Top Sider, and Bass make stylish looking boat shoes that can be dressed up or dressed down.Another classic nautical style is loafers. Look for a pair of loafers in neutral colors like brown or white. Avoid square toed loafers, as they can look too dressy. Instead, go for round toed loafers in soft leather or canvas., A fun and easy way to add some nautical style to your wardrobe is through accessories like a hat, a belt, or a tie.Top your nautical look with a straw hat or a slick fedora in a light woven material.
Tuck your shirt into your seersucker shorts or pants and wear a light leather belt. Or be bold with a bungee belt in complementing hues of orange and gold.
Add a striped tie to a plain white collared shirt for a nautical look that is appropriate for the office. Wear a tie bar with an anchor tip or a wave shape. But only wear the nautical tie or the nautical tie bar. You don’t want to end up overdoing the nautical look!
Add some nautical to a navy or gray suit with a pocket square with an anchor or ship print.

Choose cotton balls or polyfill.,
Wash the clothes.,
Glue cotton batting or cotton balls to the clothes.,
Cut the ear shapes out of black or white felt, depending on your costume.,
Glue the ears to a plastic headband.,
Use a white or black beanie for the head.,
Use the hood of your sweatshirt as the head.,
Wear black socks on your feet and hands.,
Paint the tip of your nose black.,
Wrap black tape around the wrists and ankles.",How to Make a Sheep Costume," Choose a sweatshirt and sweatpants of the appropriate size for the costume wearer. You can go with white for a fully white sheep, or a black sweatsuit for a black sheep. Choose a hooded sweatshirt for one version of the costume or a crew neck if you want to have a separate hat or headband.If you think you’ll be too hot in a sweatsuit, you could go with a long sleeve shirt instead. Sweatpants are probably your best option for pants, unless you want to choose some tights, leggings, or other simple black or white pants.
If you use clothes you already have rather than buying new ones for the costume, remember that you’ll be using glue that is permanent. Once you make the costume, the clothes are ruined for regular wear.;
, For a small child’s costume, you can use cotton balls because you won’t be covering a large area. If the costume is for an adult, you’ll want to use some kind of synthetic cotton or polyfill batting because it will attach more quickly, and cover more area, than cotton balls. You can use polyfill for a child’s costume, as well.Cotton balls can be purchased at any big-box store or pharmacy. Batting can be purchased at big-box stores, but you might have to go to a craft store.
Cotton balls give a more textured and authentic look, but cotton batting will attach much faster and cover more space. If you are in a hurry, don’t use cotton balls.

, It won’t be easy to wash the costume once it is fully assembled, so wash everything now if you want to. It is especially good to wash brand new clothes to break them in a little and make them more comfortable. It is not necessary to wash clothes that you’ve worn many times if they are clean already.

, Using hot glue or fabric glue, begin attaching the cotton to the shirt and pants. Bunch the cotton batting up as you glue it, so it looks like sheep's wool. Place the cotton balls close together so there aren’t gaps.You don’t have to cover the entire surface of the clothes with cotton. You can leave a few inches at the end of the sleeves and pant legs to mimic the way that a sheep’s wool stops before the hooves.

, Make them about six inches (15 cm) long and two and a half inches wide (6 cm). Use one layer of felt for basic ears, or sew two pieces of felt together for fluffier ears. Both pieces can be the same color, or you can create an inner and outer ear by using one black and one white piece of felt per ear.Be creative to make the ears look the way you want them to. Stuff a few cotton balls or a chunk of polyfill between the pieces of felt before you sew them together to make the ears look plump.
Use black and white paper or another fabric besides felt if you don’t have felt or don’t want to buy any. Use only one piece of felt for each ear if you don’t want them double thick.

, Glue the ears to the headband so they flop downward or stick out to the sides. Cut out a circle of white paper and glue a bunch of cotton balls to it. Glue this to the top of the headband to mimic the tufts of wool on top of the sheep’s head., Take a white or black skullcap style sock hat and sew or glue the ears onto the sides. Take a couple of handfuls of cotton balls and glue them to the top of the hat. Make sure to use a hat that fits tightly on your head and doesn’t have a point on top or a droop in the back.If you don’t want to attach ears to the beanie, put the headband with ears over the beanie.

, If you bought a hooded sweatshirt, you can attach the ears and head tufts directly to the hood. Sew or glue the ears onto the sides of the hood and attach some cotton balls to the top. This option allows you to easily slide back the head portion if you start to get too hot in the costume., One way to make the costume even more realistic is to wear long, black socks to look like hooves. If you will be walking around outside, wear black shoes. Take them off when you get inside, if you want to. You could also wear black gloves or mittens so your hands are still useable., Using washable craft paint, black lipstick, or eye-black, cover the tip of your nose. Don’t paint all the way up the bridge of your nose or all the way under your nostrils. Paint about a one inch diameter section at the end of your nose.Place a six or seven dots of paint on your top lip under your nose like whiskers and add red lipstick to make the look pop.

, If you chose a white sweatshirt and you are not wearing socks or gloves on your hands, use black tape on the wrists and ankles of the clothes to mimic where the wool ends and the hooves begin. Duct tape or athletic cloth tape works well."

, You can also repurpose a fleece sweat suit into an adult costume, or turn a large fleece sweatshirt into a bodysuit for a child.Fleece is an excellent material for costumes because it’s synthetic material and doesn’t fray.
In place of a fuzzy body rabbit costume, you can find a solid colored sweat suit in pink, white or grey.
In place of a fuzzy rabbit costume, you can also do ballet tights, a tutu and a ballet leotard for a little girl. Then, you can add a tail and ears.

, Cut out a small hole for your head by cutting a semi-circle halfway through the folded edge. Turn it inside out and slip it over your head to measure the rest of the suit.


Keep your cuts conservative. You can always cut more, but you can’t cut less.

, The “pinch and pin” tailoring method is a fast way to tailor a costume to the exact measurements of your body. You can make it as loose or tight as you want.

, If you have more fabric, you can continue pinching and pinning around the legs to make a full body suit.

, Sew along the pin line with a sewing machine. Use a thread that matches the body suit. Turn the suit right side out and try it on.

, Cut out a circle of satin, felt or fleece in a contrasting shade of white, grey or pink. Glue it to the center of the suit, from your chest to your waist.


Reserve some of this colored fabric for the inside of your rabbit ears.

, If possible, cover all the skin except your face to make a convincing fur coat.

, Attach sturdy wire to the top of the ears by wrapping it around the headband once. The excess wire should continue up about six inches to give form to your bunny ears.

, You can use the template at http://d7nsd3m1z2har.cloudfront.net/Bunny%20Ears.pdf to draw perfect oval ears. Measure out four pieces for the front and back of the ears.


, Press the outside of the fabric together. Sew around the perimeter, and then turn the ear inside out. Repeat with the other ear.

, Affix them to the outside of the ears with sewing pins.

, Make sure you don’t go too far inside the inner ear, or you will not leave enough space to fit your wire.


Repeat with the opposite ear.

, Bend one ear halfway down, if you want to be a lop-eared rabbit.

, Use a strong craft or fabric glue.

, Glue as you wrap it to secure it well.

,, Marabou boas are available in craft stores.You can also attach batting from a pillow to the back of your costume for an easy puffy tail., Leave it to dry overnight before using.

, Stick safety pins from the inside of the suit. Catch some of the boa in the pin before you pull it back inside the fabric.

, Set up a sewing machine where you will have enough space to feed the fabric from the front to the back of the machine. Get a pair of sharp scissors to obtain the smoothest cuts in your fabric. A quality fabric glue can also help save you some time sewing. Gather these tools and have them ready when you begin making your costume:


Scissors
Sewing machine
Fabric glue
Tape measure

, Use a clean table to lay out your pieces of fabric flat for cutting. Make sure you are in a place with plenty of light. Move a lamp next to your table if possible.

, Buy a sweatshirt and sweatpants that are golden colored for the lion’s body.


A golden colored onesie makes a great lion’s body for a toddler.

, Measure the distance from the middle of the chest to the belly button. Cut a felt oval to cover the belly of the person wearing the costume.

, Use fabric glue or sew a brown felt oval to the stomach of the costume.If you are using a onesie, place the felt on the front of the onesie. Cut the oval in half where the zipper of the onesie goes up.

, Measure the ovals to be 6 inches tall by 4 inches wide. Depending on the age and size of the person wearing the costume, you may want to make the ears larger or smaller., Leave one of the short ends of the ovals unsewn. Use a sewing machine or hand stitch the fabric together around the edges.

, Push the fabric through the unsewn end to turn the stitching on the inside of the ear.

, Use pillow filling to fill the ears. Place enough filling to give the ears some volume. You do not need to stuff the ear completely full; a small wad in each ear is enough.

, Push the filling to the outside to create a full look around the exterior of the ear. Add more stuffing if you need to create a thicker ear. Place a few stitches in the center of the ear to keep the middle pinched together. , Wrap the open ends of the ears around a plastic headband. Attach the ears to the headband by sewing the open ends together around the band.

, Visit your local fabric store to obtain yellow, gold, and brown colored fleece fabric.


Get ½ yard of each color of fleece.
Buy a 1-yard piece of 1"" elastic.

, Measure around the person’s head from top to bottom. You want to measure under the chin, around the face, and over the crown of the person’s head.

, Make the elastic shorter than the distance around the head so it will fit snugly when stretched around the head.

, Cut a strip of fabric 2 ¼ inches wide. Place the elastic inside the fleece and sew the long edge of the fleece fabric together with the elastic inside.


Cut another 2 1/2 inch strip of fleece to use for the lion’s tail.

, Create fringe to make the lion’s mane with strips of fabric. Cut the strips to be 3-6 inches long and ¾ inch wide.

, Use fabric glue or a simple hand stitch to attach the fringe strips to the yellow band with the elastic.Alternate colors and stack multiple strips to create a colorful look.

, Finish the headband by connecting the two ends of the elastic together to form a circle.


Make sure to firmly connect the ends of the elastic together so the stretching does not rip the seam.

, Place the lion’s mane around your face by stretching the elastic under your chin and over the top of your head.

, Cut a piece of yellow fleece 2 1/2 inches wide and 3 feet long. Sew the long edges of the fabric together to form a hollow tube of fabric., Use the same pillow filling that you used for the ears to provide some body to your lion’s tail.

, Use fabric glue to attach brown yarn or thin strips of brown fleece to the tip of the tail.


Wrap brown yarn loosely around your hand 10 times.
Pull the yarn off your hand and squeeze the loops at one end.
Tie a piece of yarn around one end of the loops to secure them together.
Cut the yarn on the opposite end from where you tied to create frayed ends.
Glue the yarn “hair” to the end of the tail.

, Sew the end of the tail to the back of the pants or back of the onesie. Use a needle and thread to apply a few stitches to the tail to attach it to the costume.

Face paint can be found at a costume shop or hobby shop. If Halloween is coming up, you may also be able to find it available in the seasonal section of your local pharmacy., Decide which method you will use to create your shell and make sure you get everything you will need.


If you are making a shell out of a roasting pan, get a disposable aluminum roasting pan. These can be found in grocery stores and dollar stores in the baking section. Look for a pan with an oval shape which has a pattern stamped into the bottom for catching grease, which looks similar to the pattern on a shell. These are usually used for roasting large birds like turkeys.Choose your paint. You will want some dark brown and dark green spray paint. If you choose to make some color accents on your shell, you can also pick up some water-based acrylics and big paint brushes at your local hobby shop.Purchase some painters tape. This is available at a hobby shop or hardware store. You want to get some which is thin and will fit in the molded lines of the pan, about 3/4 inch wide.Pick up some wide brown ribbon. You may be able to find this in the stationary section of your local Target or Walmart. You can also get ribbon at a hobby shop or fabric store. This is going to be used to strap the shell to your back. Opt for a ribbon which is strong and will be comfortable on your shoulders.


If you choose to make your shell out of felt, you will need some dark green and light green felt along with a few other items. Make sure you purchase enough dark green felt to create an oval which will cover your back, as well as another oval 3 inches (7.6 cm) larger than the first. You will need half as much light green felt.

Get a glue gun and glue sticks.
This method requires a sewing machine and you will want to get dark green thread if you don’t already have some.
Purchase a large bag of stuffing. Thicker stuffing used for stuffed animals is a better choice then a softer pillow stuffing.
Find one or two large pieces of cardboard. You will need a surface large enough to create an oval large enough to cover your back. You may want two ovals of the same size to reinforce the base of your shell.
Pick up some wide dark green ribbon to match your dark green felt. You may be able to find this in the stationary section of your local Target or Walmart. You can also get ribbon at a hobby shop or fabric store. This is going to be used to strap the shell to your back. Opt for a ribbon which is strong and will be comfortable on your shoulders.



, The pan is already pretty close to looking like a turtle shell, which is really convenient. It is also easily malleable if you would like to make any adjustments.


If the lip on the pan is really large, fold it over into the inside of the pan to reduce the squared corners. Avoid cutting this section, which could leave sharp edges.
Push out from the inside of the pan to round out the bends in the roasting pan until the sides look more rounded like a turtle shell.

, This is where the ribbon will be threaded to hold the pan on your back, so think about where the straps of a backpack would go. Put two holes in the top corners of the pan and two in the bottom. It is helpful to put the top holes and little wider apart and the bottom holes a little closer together by about one inch. This has the effect of cinching the straps near your waist. The holes should be about the size of the width of a pen or pencil.


Use a drill to make these holes if you have one.
The pan can also be punctured with other sharp tools like scissors or a screwdriver.

, You will want to cover both the inside and outside of the pan, as some of the inside may be visible. Spray paint the entire roasting pan with your dark brown spray paint on the inside and outside of the pan. Allow this layer to dry for about 15-20 minutes.

, These will become the lines between the scales of the turtle shell and you want them to remain the dark brown color.


If your tape is too wide for the crevices, cut it to fit.

, Don’t worry about making this layer too thick. Allowing some of the brown to show through the green paint will give the shell a nice textured look.


For even more texture, use a large paint brush and green acrylic paint to dry brush on the green color. Squeeze the paint onto a palette and apply a small amount of paint to the brush without using any water. Lightly brush the green over the brown spray paint using cross strokes.

, You want to make sure it is completely dry before you move on. Make sure it is dry to the touch, especially along the edges where it may have gathered excess paint.

, The tape should not remove any of the paint underneath it. If it does, you can touch these areas up with a brown marker.

, You can use a pencil or screwdriver to help you get the ribbon through the hole. You will want to push it from the inside to the outside of the pan so that the majority of the ribbon is hanging on the inside to create your shoulder strap.

, Make sure the knot is big enough that it will not slip through the hole. If it is too small, tie it a second time to make the knot bigger.

, You should now have two ribbons hanging from the top of the shell on the inside of the pan.

, Push the ends of the ribbons into the holes in the bottom of the shell to make two shoulder straps. You will want to push them from the inside out again. Don’t tie knots yet.


In order to get the straps the correct length, it is best to have a friend hold the shell in place on your back before you tie knots in the bottom of the ribbons.
Pull the ribbons tight until the shell feels secure on your back, then tie knots in both ribbons to complete the shoulder straps.

, This should be an appropriate size to fit on your back. If the cardboard seems flimsy, you could cut a second oval out of cardboard and glue the two together for reinforcement.

, Place the cardboard oval on top of the dark green felt. Using a pencil, hold the tip as close as you can keep it to the edge of the cardboard as you trace around the oval onto the felt.


It is useful to keep one edge of the oval on the edge of the felt to make it easier to cut from the felt.
Make sure you are saving enough felt to create a second, larger oval.

, Using fabric scissors, carefully cut the oval from the fabric staying on the pencil line as much as possible.

, Place the cardboard oval on the remainder of the dark green felt.


Measure three inches from the edge of the cardboard oval and move around the cardboard drawing dots on the felt three inches from the edge of the cardboard all the way around the oval.
Connect the dots with a pencil to draw an oval three inches larger than the original oval
Using fabric scissors, carefully cut this oval out of the dark green felt.

, Machine baste this oval using as long a stitch as possible.

, Pull one of the threads on the large oval to draw the edges in toward the center of the oval. Tie a knot in both threads to hold them in place.

, Don’t skimp on the stuffing. Use as much as you can possible get into the oval.

, Place your cardboard base on top of the stuffed oval. Wrap the edges of the felt over the cardboard and attach it to the cardboard using hot glue.

, Think of these straps as those on a backpack to help you place them.


Place the slits in the bottom of the oval about one inch closer together than the slits on the top in order to create a cinching effect near the waist to keep the shell more secure on your back.
Pinch the felt between your thumb and forefinger where you are going to create the slit in order to cut within the fabric as opposed to starting from the edge.

, Push the edge of the ribbon through the slits in the top of the small oval. The smaller bit of the ribbon will be on the underside of the felt oval. The length will create the straps. Push the other end of the ribbons through the slits in the bottom of the oval.

, Attach the top of the straps first, then glue the oval over the gathered edges of your shell to create a back to your shell.


Place the oval over the cardboard to completely cover the back of your shell.
Glue the small part of the ribbon to the cardboard to create the top of the straps.
Attach the small felt oval to the cardboard using hot glue around the edges. Start at the top and working your way down. Stop before you reach the bottom of the oval.
Attach the bottom of the straps to the cardboard before gluing the rest of the oval onto the cardboard. It is helpful to place the shell on your back at this point to get the appropriate length for your straps before gluing them.
Finish gluing the rest of the oval over the cardboard base.

, You will need several shapes to cover the shell. Use hexagons,squares and a four-sided shape with one rounded side, resembling an ice-cream cone shape.


Cut 5 hexagons out of the lighter green felt. The top and bottom lines should be longer than the other lines creating the triangular points on the sides. Cut two of these hexagons in half.
Make enough small squares to cover the entire edge of the shell, leaving space between each tile to let the dark green felt show through the space between the squares.
Cut 6 of the four-sided shapes which will cover the top and the bottom of the shell. These shapes will create the scales filling the top and the bottom of the shell between the hexagonal scales. They should have one short side for the bottom, then two sides splaying out at a diagonal and a rounded top.

, Start by placing one in the very center of the shell with the long sides running on the top and bottom of the hexagon so the shape is placed longways.


Leaving enough space to allow the dark green felt to make lines between the scales, glue one hexagon above the center one, and the other hexagon below the center one.

, The points of the half hexagons should fit between the points of the top and center, and bottom and center whole hexagons.

, The points will face toward the center of the shell with the cut end facing the edge of the shell. Leave enough space between the scales to allow the dark green felt to create lines between the scales.

, It may be helpful to design these shapes once the others are in place to make sure that they fit appropriately to cover the top and bottom edges of the shell while leaving space between the shapes to allow the dark green bottom layer to create lines between the scales. Glue these 6 shapes in place.

, Glue the squares all the way around the edges of the shell to complete the scales. Leave enough space between the square to allow the dark green felt to show through and create lines all the way around the squares.


It is helpful to place the squares all the way around the shell before gluing them to make sure that you have enough space to fit them all completely within the edges.
If you don’t have enough space when you complete your circle, you may need to cut one of the squares to fit the space available. Finish at the bottom of the shell.

, Cover yourself in green from head to toe with green shoes, socks, pants and shirt.


A green hoodie is a good option to cover your head in green. You can also try skull cap hat.
You may opt for green tights and a brown leotard to match your shell.

, Don’t forget your face when it comes to your costume. You can use as much or as little makeup as you choose.


Apply a full layer of green face paint to cover your face, neck and ears. Cover your skin in green a little past the collar of your shirt to make sure you’re skin color won’t show when your shirt shifts as you move. If you didn’t find green mittens, you will also want to paint your hands.
If you choose not to completely cover your skin in green, you can opt to just do some green highlights like eyeshadow.

, Put your arms through the straps and make sure it’s snug. If the shell shifts around too much as you move, take it off and shorten the straps about an inch on each side.

Wrap tape around the bottom of the fan to hold it open as you work.Look for a Marabou fan with bright blue or green feathers if you want a brighter, more colorful peacock costume. This would be especially fitting if you intend to make the costume for a child, but this can be used for an adult costume, as well.
If you plan on making this as an adult costume, you could look for a Marabou fan with black feathers for something a little sultrier.
For added authenticity, you can even look for a Marabou fan that is trimmed with peacock feathers.;
, Use a hot glue gun to glue the tips of 12 peacock eye feathers to the tip of the fan.


A child-size tail will need a total of about 50 ""eye"" feathers and 50 ""sword"" feathers. An adult tail may need several dozen more.
The feathers should be between 30 and 35 inches (76 and 89 cm) long, but you may need to trim off up to 12 inches (30 cm) for a child's costume.
Alternate which side of the feathers faces up so that both sides look nice when finished.

, Use a hot glue gun to glue the tips of 11 peacock sword feathers to the tip of the fan. Place the swords in between the eye feathers.


The sword feathers should be slightly shorter than the peacock eye feathers, but only by 1 or 2 inches (2.5 or 5 cm).
Turn the sword feathers so that they are angled in toward the center.
""Sword"" feathers refer to peacock feathers that have the traditional coloring of a peacock tail but not the trademark ""eye"" pattern at the upper end.

, Continue adding peacock eye and sword feathers until there are very few, if any, gaps remaining in the tail.


Apply hot glue to the stems of the remaining layers. The stems should not only be fixed to the tip of the fan, but also to the feathers of the fan and the stems of lower layers.
Glue the peacock feathers on in layers. Many of the stems will overlap.

, Use hot glue to attach a piece of thick cardboard over both sides of the plastic portion of the fan. Close the bottom up by attaching the two pieces of cardboard together with duct tape.


Place the fan over the cardboard and trace around the plastic portion of the fan. Cut out two identical pieces using scissors and trim away as much as necessary to only cover the plastic portion of the fan. Do not cover any of the feathers.

, Cut out two pieces of felt or sparkly fabric. The pieces should match the shape and size of the cardboard cutouts.


Use hot glue to secure the fabric in place.
If possible, use ravel-proof fabric so that the ends will not fray with use.

, Buy a craft mask that only covers the eyes, making sure that it fits the face of the intended wearer.


A gold mask creates a brighter, more playful appearance, and can be used for a child's or adult's costume.A black mask is better suited for adult costumes as it creates a more ""mature"" look.

, Remove the mask's elastic string and slide two pieces of narrow ribbon into the holes, instead.


Measure the distance from the outer corner of one eye to the outer corner of the other, taking the tape measure around the back of your head. Divide this measurement in half, then add 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm) to this number. Cut two strands of ribbon that equal this measurement.
Tie a piece of the ribbon into each hole. When putting the mask on, tie the two ribbons together in a loose bow.

, Use hot glue to attach small beads or craft gems around the eyes of the mask, positioning them either along the sides or near the corners of the eye holes.


Use clear, white, or silver gems for a black mask. Apply blue and green gems if you are using a gold mask.

, Outline the gems in silver glitter glue and connect the outlines with swirling glitter glue lines.


This step is only optional. If you like the way the mask looks without the glue, you can skip it.

, Glue four short black feathers to one corner of the mask and glue two or three short peacock feathers on top.


Attach the feathers with hot glue.
Arrange the feathers so that they come up and out at a slight angle.
Glue a larger gem or hair clip over the tip of the feathers.

,


Hold the tape measure parallel to the floor all the way around.
Place the tape measure around the area at which you expect to tutu to be worn.

, Measure a band of 2-in (5-cm) elastic to match the distance around your stomach.


Instead of black elastic, you could also use blue, green, silver, or gold. Choose elastic that is nice enough to wear without being covered by additional fabric.

, Use 2 to 3 yards (1.8 to 2.7 m) of 6-in (15-cm) tulle. Half the tulle should be green and the other half should be blue.


If desired, you can also add in some black tulle.
Cut the tulle into strips that are twice as long as the distance between your intended waistband and knees.

, Knot the tulle in a double layer over the elastic band. Cover the band completely.


Alternate between green and blue tulle strips, weaving the occasional black strip in if desired.
Fold each tulle strip in half and place it beneath the elastic band. Hold the fold just above the band and stuff the ends and the rest of the tulle into the loop made by the fold, crossing over the elastic band and pulling the entire length of tulle through the loop. This should secure the tulle strip onto the band.

, Use a needle and thread to hand stitch the ends of the elastic band together, forming a continuous circle.


Use your fingers to gently ""fluff"" and position the tulle so that the tutu looks full.

, The overall length of the feathers should be between about 4 and 5 inches (13 cm).


Apply a dot of hot glue to the back of each feather and press the feathers against a plain metal hair clip or barrette. The feathers should be slightly fanned away from each other. They should also be pointed up and out at a mild angle.

, Cut three circles of varying sizes out of scrap synthetic fabric.


Choose a blue, green, or black fabric so that it matches the feathers.
Make sure that you do not choose a flammable fabric. The material you use should be relatively flame-resistant.
The largest circle should be about 1.5 inches (4 cm). The middle should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) and the smallest should be a little more than 0.5 inch (1.25 cm). The sizes and shapes of the circles do not need to be perfect, though.

, Use a lighter to slightly melt and curl the edges of each circle.


This is why it is vital that you use a non-flammable fabric.
Hold the edges of the circle near the flame, but do not allow the fabric to touch the flame directly. The edges should curl even without being directly immersed in the fire.

, Stack the circles and sew them together in the center using clear thread.


The largest circle should be on the bottom and the smallest should be on top.
Stack the circle slightly off-center from one another in order to create a flower shape.

, Hand stitch a few small, translucent beads in the center of the flower to create a center.


Use the same clear thread.

, Apply a generous dot of hot glue on the back of the flower and place it onto the remaining visible portion of the hair clip.


The flower should cover the stems of the feathers.

, A royal blue dress is perfect for a child's costume or an adult's costume, while a “little black dress” can be appropriate for an adult's costume.


A knee-length dress will work on most body types and ages. You should choose a simple dress without any embellishments, but otherwise, any cut, length, neckline, and sleeve length will work. It is mostly a matter of personal preference.

, Royal blue tights work well for both children and adults. Both kids and adults could also wear white or black tights.


For a more mature look, an adult could wear sheer flesh-tone nylons instead.

, Step into the tulle skirt and pull it up so that it rests comfortably on your stomach.

, Tuck the end of the tail into the band of the skirt. Keep the skirt and tail in place by tying a metallic green or gold ribbon around the elastic band of the skirt, wrapping it around several times and knotting the ribbon in place at your side or back.


Tie the ribbon snugly so that it holds the tail in place and keeps it secure.
The feathers of the tail should face upward, fanning out behind the wearer's back.

, A simple pair of blue, green, silver, gold, or black ballet flats should work well for this outfit.


If you want something a little sultrier or more mature, you could wear a gold or black heeled sandal.

, Style your hair as desired. Tie the mask over your eyes and place the hair clip in your hair.

These will be the inner ears., These form the completed mouse ears.

, The costume will look best if the hoodie is the same color as the outer ears.


Make sure that one mouse ear is attached to each side of the hood, and not too high up on it. You can put on the hood and test out the ears before attaching them to decide which exact position looks best.

, This step is optional, but can add a touch more flair if you have time. Lay the hoodie on a flat surface, and cut out an oval of pink felt (or another contrasting color) that is the width and height of the front of the hoodie. Then sew, glue, or pin the oval to the hoodie to serve as the belly.

, Simply put them on once the rest of the costume is finished.

, Take a tube sock that is the same color as the outer mouse ears and the hoodie (or pink).Fill it with newspaper or fiberfill so that it looks like a tail, then sew, glue, or pin it to either the bottom back of the sweatshirt or the back waistband of the sweatpants.


You can cut off one leg of a pair of tights and use it in the same way to make a mouse-tail—just make sure to tie, sew, glue, or pin one end closed before you stuff it.

, You can use regular makeup. Put a dot of pink lipstick on the end of your nose to make the mouse’s nose. Use eyeliner (black, brown, or white) to draw a few whiskers across your cheeks.

, If you would like to complete the mouse look, you can put socks on your feet that match the color of the mouse costume, and socks or mittens on your hands. These will serve as the mouse’s paws. You can use socks or mittens of the same color, or a contrasting one. For instance, if you have a black mouse body, then white paws might look nice.

Dress up your horse.,The Rider (Prehistoric Caveman/woman)

,
Make the bone.,
Create the club with paper mache: Scrunch up pieces of paper and use masking tape all around to keep them in the shape of a club.,
Create the club with cardboard: Cut out the shape of a club on brown or grey cardboard.,
Make your outfit.,
Make your shoes.",How to Make a Triceratops Horse Costume,", Get three A-4 pieces of any coloured cardboard you want. On one piece of cardboard, cut out the shape of a short horn curving backwards. It should be 15 centimeter (5.9 in) in length and 5 centimeter (2.0 in) wide. On the other two, make two straight horns about the length and width of a 30 centimeter (11.8 in) ruler.

, Cut out a jagged frill on cardboard the same colour as the horns. It should be just a semicircle shape. Make sure you measure your horse's headpiece, because that is where it will attach.

, Place the two longer horns on either side of your horse's browband. The short, curved horn should attach to the top of your horse's noseband. Use bluetac to secure the horns if the costume is only temporary. The frill should fit over the top of the horse's headpiece, behind its ears. Again, secure with bluetac. To finish the look, you should use a very thick french plait down the tailbone, and then plait ALL the hair to the end, so the whole tail is one plait. Make sure there is no loose hairs. This means that the tail looks more authentic because Triceratops didn't have tail hair!

,, Cut out the shape of a bone from a piece of white cardboard. This bone will attach to the top of your helmet so it looks like a bone threaded through hair.

, Paper mache with newspaper for the first three layers. Once those layers are dry, paper mache white paper on. This is so you can paint it. Paint the club brown or grey.

, Its that easy. This is a cheaper (and less messy) alternative to paper mache.

, You can buy a furry cape like the Flintstones wear, or you can make your own out of a large bag. A chaff bag or garbage bag will do the trick. Paint it whatever colour you like.

, Horse riding is dangerous, and you should always wear shoes. Get plain sneakers and cover them with grey scrunched up paper so the look like they're made of rocks, or cover them with pieces of green paper to make them appear to be covered in leaves.

, Use this measurement to mark the length on the paper or cardboard. Leave a little overlap at one end to allow for a join.

, The fringe should be a decent size, so make the width at least 5cm-7.5cm (2 to 3 inches wide), which will allow for cutting space.


Draw a line indicating the width down the length of the paper/cardboard.







, Cut at least two more lengths measuring the same. You should have at least three strips when done, to allow for layers of the mane.

Buy a pair of pre-made mouse ears.Mouse ear headbands can be purchased from many department and party stores, especially around Halloween.,
Use clothing for the mouse body.Some clothing that is the same color (usually black, brown, gray, or white) as the pre-made mouse ears will make a quick and simple mouse body for your costume.,
Attach a tail.You can use a strip of cloth, or stuff a sock (or one half-of a pair of leggings) with newspaper or fiberfill.,
Paint on a mouse face.Use makeup to draw a mouse face on your own once you put the rest of the costume on.,
Put on paws.",How to Make a Mouse Costume2," When you need to make a mouse costume in a hurry, these are a great start.


You can also easily make your own mouse ears headband. Just cut two small (about two inches) rounded ears out of felt or furry fabric (gray, brown, black, or white) and glue them to a plain headband.
You can also glue a pipe cleaner to each ear and attach its ends to the headband for more stability., You can use clothing you already have, or purchase new items.


Women can use things like a tank dress, leggings and a tank top, a solid color dress, or sweatpants and a sweatshirt.
Men can use things like sweatpants and a sweatshirt, or pants and a t-shirt of the same color.
Anyone can also use some black, brown, gray or white footed pajamas as the mouse’s body., Just make sure that the tail is the same color as the clothing you are using for the mouse’s body (or pink).

, Use pink lipstick to draw a dot or triangle on the end of your nose to form the mouse’s nose. Draw a few whiskers on your cheeks using eyeliner (black, brown, or white).

, You can put socks on your feet and socks or mittens on your hands to use as the mouse paws, if you would like. If you are using footed pajamas as your mouse body, you will just need a pair of socks or mittens to put on your hands.

Use a ruler to mark regular spaces for cutting the fringe on each length.,
Cut each fringe piece along each length.,
Staple or glue the fringe lengths together.,
Tape the ends together.",How to Make a Lion Fringe2," Do this all the way along the length.


Only draw the cutting marks 3/4 of the way, as the fringe needs to stay intact.







,


Only cut 3/4 of the way to ensure that the fringe pieces stay in place.







, This creates the desired mane volume. The fringes should overlap slightly, to make it easier to see the fringes in the bottom layers.

, The circle that forms should fit around the face of the wearer for whom this was measured.


Use the extra piece cut for joining to make this easier; check around the face area before making the join final.

Obtain a base for the wig.,
Choose a yarn to make the hair out of.,
Using a yarn darner, start threading the yarn into the wig base.,
Use a fine tooth comb to fray the yarn.,
Use markers to add colour to the wig.,
Style the wig.",How to Make a Jellicle Cat Wig," The most common materials used are pantyhose (cut the legs off and sew up the holes), swimming caps, or crocheted hats.;
, While you can use colors similar to the actual wig, it is easier to use white and color it later, especially if it is going to have stripes or other markings. Make sure the yarn frays easily and is not resistant to dye/ink. Cut it into a generous amount of pieces anywhere between 5 inches (12.7 cm) to 2 feet (0.6 m) in length, depending on which cat's wig you're making. However, don't fray it yet.

, Tie the yarn in the middle; you will then have two pieces about two and a half inches long standing up with a knot in the middle. Do this all over the wig base.

, Once it is frayed, it will resemble the hair of the actual wigs.

, While fabric markers are popular for this, Sharpies may work too if the wig is going to be mostly gray or black (like Munkustrap's, for example). Keep stripes and other markings in mind when you do this.

, While there are exceptions, most of the Jellicles have ears, which are made by twisting two bunches of hair and holding them in place (glue, hair gel, and hairspray are usually used for this). To ensure that the ears don't fall out of place, use some very small rubber bands/ponytail holders around the tips. This will make it look like there are little balls on the tips of the ears, but it will not make your wig look wrong and it is often even seen on professional wigs.

Explain to your child what you class as ""explicit"" music, so they know exactly what it is that you don't want them listening to.,
Explain to your child why you forbid certain songs or albums.,
Once you have explained your reasons, you may guarantee your child cannot listen to explicit music on CD, tape or vinyl by confiscating these items, but be aware that the music might be hidden under other titles.,
Ask yourself why certain music bothers you so much.,
If they continue to defy you, try again.,
Explain to your child that there there will be consequences for disobedience, if they continue listening to explicit music.,
Be familiar with what your child listens to and check to see if it's appropriate.,
Ask your child about what they listen to on YouTube or via other websites that host music and/or music videos.,
If your child listens to explicit music after being told not on more than one occasion, more serious actions make be required such as grounding for several days or a week.",How to Stop Your Child from Listening to Explicit Music," If you suspect they are already to listening to lyrics or artists you don't approve of, make sure of your facts before you try to ban it. You may be able to reach a compromise about some albums with only one mild swear word.;
, You may believe explicit music is music that has bad teachings in it such as profanity, abusive, hateful words, or words that incite prejudice, or homophobia, etc. You may explain that sometimes people who listen to explicit music can become desensitized to the bad influences such words and ideas bring. Of course, there may also be other personal reasons you may wish to share with your child.

, This is why your child's cooperation is so very important and will result in their learning from you, rather than looking for ways around your rules.

, Be aware that your child's desire to listen to this type of music might increase the more you tell them not to listen to it. You won't be able to censor everything they come into contact with. Some radio stations bleep out explicit lyrics in songs, others don't. You won't be able to stop your child searching for music with lyrics you don't approve of on computers in internet cafes or in libraries and you cannot control what they listen to at friends' houses.

, Talk to your child about what it is they like about music with explicit lyrics in and try to find something similar that is not explicit. Exploring the huge range of music available to find something you both like could be a pleasant bonding experience and an opportunity to spend quality time together. Tell your child what you listened to at their age and why you liked it. This may help you find common ground.

, A consequence could be the removal of a privilege, such as a ban on TV, being grounded, or having all access to music taken away. Only you as a parent will know what punishment will work best for your child, but remember to temper your rights as their parent with compassion and understanding; you were young once, too.

, Remember, there are many artists, so research those you hear your child talking about and any new CDs brought into the house.

, Block things you are uncomfortable with your child accessing, if you can't trust you child to make good choices about what they listen to online. If you suspect your child is being deceitful about what they listen to, consider asking them show you their favorites and playlists. Consider carefully, before snooping on their computer, as they will consider this an invasion of their privacy and lead to trust issues regarding you.

, Again, as a parent, all of these things are in your hands and your actions will impact your relationship with your child. Be wise in your choices for both of your sakes.

Don't panic!,
Pay attention.,
Ask questions.,
Dress comfortably.,
Stay warm.,
Stay hydrated.,
Bring food!,
Always bring your script with you.,
Learn your lines.,
Listen to your director.,
Learn blocking.",How to Survive Play or Musical Rehearsals," If you've never been in a full-scale production before, you may freak out about learning lines and blocking (positioning during the performance is called blocking). Don't come into a rehearsal nervous. It will affect your reading, and you will definitely be reading for the first few rehearsals until you get your lines down. Directors and other actors are there to help. They all want to get this show on the road just as much as you, and veteran actors could certainly give you a few pointers if you need as much.;
, In Shakespeare, especially for those who have no experience with the Bard, the first few rehearsals will be spent going over common words, helping actors speak the lines as if they are dialogue and not poetry, and other similar things. It's important to pay attention to this. On a similar point, it is absolutely vital that you pay attention during a performance! You must remember when your cues are, and that means listening and watching the play from the stage so you can act on time. Delays in lines and blocking look bad and amateurish from the seats. Paying attention can help you early on, as you learn your lines and do full run-throughs. You need to be on the ball so a two hour play doesn't take four hours.

, If you don't understand what your character is feeling, be sure to ask. If your character is nervous or angry, you must read the line as such. 'Daniel!' can sound drastically different if read angrily, sadly, or in a surprised tone. It can seem odd during run-throughs and performances for you to be off, and it can throw other actors off. If you can't pronounce a word, take a second to read through it and try to figure it out. If you can't, just ask! It's likely that a fellow actor knows, or at the very least the director will. And if nobody knows, someone usually has a phone on hand to Google it.

, This can be especially vital towards the end of rehearsals, where your cast may be in dire straits and you'll practice until you've gone through the whole play. This is important throughout all the rehearsals, of course, but definitely more useful when you're learning blocking and will be moving around more instead of standing on stage and reading through or sitting and reading through. But look presentable. Dressing comfortably is not an excuse to come to practice all disheveled and wearing your old footie pajamas. Some acceptable items of dress are: pajama pants, preferably in solid colors or without cartoon or childish images on them; tank tops layered under loose fitting shirts; sneakers, like a Converse Chuck Taylor or Rocket Dog; shorts of appropriate length; crop tops, as long as they are layered; sweatshirts or hoodies. Be mindful that it isn't entirely important to look professional. The goal is to be comfortable and able to practice, while still looking presentable.

, If your show is at a community theatre, it's likely that they turn the heating down to save on money. Bring sweatpants and shorts, wearing the shorts under the sweatpants so you can take them off if you get too hot. Wearing a jacket or sweatshirt is also advised, as well as bringing a blanket. The blanket may be more applicable early on, as you may sit and read through in the seats or sit and wait in the seats as others go through various scenes, not necessarily in order. This would give you more time to actually use the blanket, and it in itself is optional. If you're rehearsing in the summer, temperature isn't such a big issue. You can open doors to keep cool, which is what typically happens in an effort to save money.

, Bring a reusable bottle of water, to quell thirst and keep you hydrated, as well as calm your throat. You'll be talking a lot, and some rehearsals can get pretty crazy before the director gets there. Teen actors aren't the most well-behaved, and even adults can run around a theatre to blow off a little steam. Water is also great if you're sick and have a sore throat. Plus, if you have the water, you're more likely to drink it. Just try to keep it off stage during run-throughs.

, There's not much worse than a hungry actor. Other than a tired, hungry actor, they're pretty hard to deal with. Pack a snack, like some fries and a few sandwiches to keep the munchies at bay. Keep your food clean (no dripping sauces or cheeses, if at all possible), especially if you'll be eating in the actual theatre. Even if you're taking a break and eating in the green room, nobody wants to have a messy green room. Backstage may be your best bet to eat, or if your theatre has a downstairs or kitchen that may be even better. If your theatre has a kitchen, store food in there until breaks so you aren't tempted to shove down handfuls of chips while reciting lines. Plus, it's okay to keep your food in the fridge for next time. Just be sure to ask your director and write your name on your food (hungry actors aren't below snatching snacks).

, If you got a version printed on white paper before getting an official bound book, keep the white paper one in a bag you take with you or at the theatre in case you forget your official script. Forgetting lines happens to the best of us, but stopping every five seconds in a particularly moving performance may not be the best for the rest of the cast. And asking over and over ""what's my line?"" sounds amateurish and unprofessional. Even if you're at the point in the play where no scripts are allowed, it's always nice to have a script to look at during some down time.

, You should know this, but it's worth mentioning. Learning your lines can help you during rehearsals immensely. It's so much easier to rehearse if you know what you're saying. Don't expect to have the whole script memorized in the first week. Just be sure to study your lines for maybe ten minutes before going to bed or during breaks at school. If you don't go to school, or if you're homeschooled, finish whatever work you may have before throwing yourself into your lines. Lines are important, they're what makes the play. But if you need to be feeding your dog/cat/fish/dragon/kid or doing homework, that's more important.

, Your director is there to direct you. Listen to them! They're in charge of blocking and all that fancy nonsense. They control the play, in a sense. It's not like if they say ""Jump"" you say ""How high?"". You do what they ask, and give feedback. They may not always tell you exactly what to do either, but they are your audience for the time being. If they're brutally honest, that's even better as much as it may bother you for them to nitpick on your acting. However, they are essentially your boss.

, Blocking is simple. It's where you move and what you physically do during a performance. One basic rule is to always have your body face the audience, but look at the character or object you're interacting with. If you're walking, you don't need to face the audience. If you do, you'll most likely look silly.

Pick the right opera.,
Choose your seats wisely.,
Do some research.,
Try to focus your attention on the orchestra rather than the story.,
Be positive.,
Make a night of it.,
Get there early.,
Go to the bathroom.,
Get settled.,
Enjoy yourself!",How to Survive an Opera," Opera newbies may find works like Wagner's ""Ring"" Cycle and even ""Der Rosenkavalier"" by Strauss intimidating. For your first opera I recommend something comic. Works by composers like Mozart are a good choice. Alternatively, classics like ""The Barber of Seville"" and ""Carmen"" are always a safe bet.;
, If you're stuck in the nosebleeds for four hours you'll be bored no matter what. Tickets can be expensive, but you don't need to sit in the orchestra to have a good time. Try to get seats in the first few rows of the balcony; their slightly more expensive than the last few rows, but it will be money well spent if you actually enjoy yourself.

, Chances are you won't be able to understand the singers, so reading a short plot synopsis will help to keep your interest and let you follow the story.

, This can be fun, especially if you've been seated somewhere that gives you better sound from them than the stage, relatively speaking., If you're bemoaning the evening ahead of you, you've already lost the chance to have a good time. Try to get excited!

, Wear something special and go out to dinner before the show. Make it a night to remember. That way, even if you don't enjoy the opera, you'll have something good to recall about the evening.

, Opera houses are designed to reflect the work they present and are often extremely beautiful. Exploring the house beforehand will help to get you excited and add some class to your evening.

, Depending on the opera there will be between one and three intermissions. While this allows for potty breaks, you should relieve yourself beforehand. There's no way you'll be able to follow the plot if nature calls five minutes into the first act and you have two hours before you can excuse yourself.

, You are in for a long evening and you will want to be comfortable. Once you find your seat, figure out how to best position yourself. However, if you enjoy the opera you won't notice how comfortable or uncomfortable your seat is.

, Enjoy the singing, the scenery, the artistry, the story! Operas are opulent affairs that are meant to be entertaining so allow yourself to be entertained.

Get followers on Twitter (get a Twitter account).,
Make special YouTube videos.,
Make sure as a developing artist you don't only stick to covering one artist (too limiting).,
Grow a big online community.,
Make newsy postings: Once you have a lot of fans, start a Facebook page where your fans can also go for bits of news on your identity.

,
If you do tours in bars, road houses, pubs and clubs, etc., then create little candid video clips of you along your way when you are touring.,
Add links to your videos and make sure you tell your fans when you have added a video, on ""all"" your social networking sites.

Twitter is often used to share ""less-personal"" (more openly public) information, unlike sites such as Facebook. Facebook people tend to have ""more-personal"" settings and only add people they know. With Twitter a lot of people use it to easily add people whom they do not know. With Twitter make sure you keep up with ""trends"". Be trendy. This is very important. It will help people notice you, so that more and more people will start to follow you.;
, As well as doing your own songs (if you have your own songs) especially start off by doing covers. Why? Searching other names/brands -- but finding your covers there -- can bring a potential army of fans. Examples of those who used covers -- Here are two known stars who both started out by doing covers of songs on YouTube: Covers plus their own music online helped start-up of Justin Bieber and Conor Maynard toward both being very popular artists. Justin in particular is the 2nd most popular person on twitter.


Do songs which are new and current as well as old time classics.

, Although a bunch of covers can draw fans, it is very important that your growing fan base knows what your identity is (explained how below).

, Focus your efforts on your current fans to gain many new fans. Get your present fans to interact with your ""social pages""/to your brand name. The more often they post to your page, the better chances that you set-up for their friends to catch it, see it, in your fan's newsfeeds and hopefully catch-on to become a new fan.

,,: Beliebers or TWFanmily/Prisoners.

,, The more someone feels appreciated, the more likely they are to communicate with your page, post positive comments and recommend your page to their friends, too.
Say ""Thank you so much; you're great."" Say (out of nowhere), ""Thanks!"" to a fan;
So, when s/he asks ""For what?"" Say, ""For being my friend!"", and shake hands and/or hug, if they allow you. Announce to your fans what you’ve put on Facebook and Twitter. Show your customers what they’re missing and encourage them to join.

, ASK, “Are you a fan/follower? If not, here’s what you’re missing!” Show the benefits of being a fan, event schedules, win prizes on Facebook, fan-only coupons? This will also show non-fans the perks of becoming a fan.


Instead of just posting a link to a song, ask your fans what they think about it. Use Facebook Questions (poll) to ask your fans anything from what kind of breakfast starts their day off right to what they like most about your songs/music. The more engaged your fans become, the more impressions your posts will get.

, Add a call-out in any messages (and recorded voicemail greeting, messages) that says “Remember, you can also reach (us) on Facebook at Facebook.com/and Twitter @.” This soothes any frustration a fan might have, if they can’t get hold of someone to answer a question or request they might have. Alert your customers of any coupons or contests you’re running on Facebook through an e-blast with direct links to your pages.


Check your Facebook Insights to see what types of posts have been most engaging with your current fans. Sort your Page Post analytics by number of Engaged Users and look at the 10 most engaging posts and the 10 least engaging posts. If the majority of most engaging posts were photos, post more photos. If they were questions, ask more questions. Analyze your least engaging posts to find out what type of content your fans are least interested in.

, How? While you keep a style so that you can build a solid fan base -- do some odd songs which are unusual enough to get noticed, and catch on, and spread around, ""going viral"" if they're fun enough...

, Get your fans -- two or three months before it is due to come out -- to pre-order it.

Let the front dry before painting the back.,
Hand wash the unitard.,
Wig.,
Find the right arm covers.,
Turn leg warmers into furry spats.,
Make the tail.",How to Make a Jellicle Cat Costume," This step isn't necessary, but it can make your project easier if you have a model for your costume. Find a photo of the front and back of the Jellicle you're using as inspiration. You don’t have to make your costume an exact replica, but you can use it for guidance.


If you don’t want to copy an existing Jellicle, study photos of all the Jellicles to get an idea of the accessories, fur, and patterns that they use so you can create your own.;
, The major element of a Jellicle cat costume is the full unitard. You need to find one that covers the legs, body, torso, and arms.


If you're making a costume for a specific Jellicle, try to find a leotard that matches the fur color. Otherwise, your best bet is to go with a white unitard.Good places to find a unitard include costume shops, dancer and gymnastic supply stores, American Apparel, and online.

, There are a number of supplies you'll need to make and decorate your costume and the accessories that go with it, including:


Fabric paint in multiple colors
A disappearing fabric marker
A pair of furry, knee-high leg warmers
A pair gloves or arm bands
A yard of faux fur material to match your cat suit
A ball of yarn in the color you want your tail to be
Small, medium, and large paint brushes
Ballet slippers
A white spiky-hair wig
A clean spray bottle
Acrylic ink
Isopropyl alcohol 70 percent

, Put on your unitard in front of a full-length mirror. Using your photo or your imagination to guide you, use the disappearing marker to indicate where you want different patterns stripes, spots, and coloration markings on the unitard.


If it’s hot where you're working, consider running a fan gently while you do this, so that you don’t get sweaty and make the marker run.
When you're finished, you might want to have a shower to wash the marker off your body in case it bled through., To turn your white unitard into a cat suit, you have to paint it with cat-like stripes and spots. On a hard, flat surface, lay out some newspapers or a canvas drop sheet to protect your work surface. Place a layer of plastic or newspaper inside the unitard to separate the front and back and prevent the paint from bleeding.Use the marks you made with the disappearing marker to guide you regarding patterning and colors. Be sure to use a thin layer of paint, otherwise the paint will be thick and bulge off the fabric.
Use the small paint brush to paint crosshatches to create patches.
Use the small paint brush to create tight vertical lines to create diagonal stripes
To make your job easier and avoid having to constantly wash your brushes, paint one color at a time before moving on to the next color.
When you have finished creating all the designs, use your large brush to paint the unitard in the color of the cat’s body.

, Once you’ve finished painting the front of the cat suit, let it dry overnight. Otherwise, you may smear and smudge the paint and ruin all the hard work you’ve put into the suit.


The next day, you can flip the unitard over and paint the back. Use the same methods and techniques that you used for the front.
When finished, allow the paint to dry overnight again.

, The paint may be somewhat crunchy or hard, but it will soften up over time as you wash the suit. Wash the suit by hand with a mild hand soap to remove excess paint and marker.


When clean, lay the suit on a large towel and blot it dry with a second towel. Hang it to dry.

, For this you'll need to find a blonde wig with long spiky hair (sometimes called punker wigs). You'll also need acrylic ink (2-ounce bottles) in all the colors you want the hair to be, 70 percent rubbing alcohol, and enough clean spray bottles for each color ink you're using.Use elastic bands to section the wig and divide the hair into patches that will be different colors. Pick one color to start with, such as red, for instance. Leave out all the sections you want to dye red and cover the other sections with plastic wrap to protect them.
Take the wig outside and lay down a large plastic bag to protect the ground.
With your first color, pour the ink into a spray bottle, then add equal amounts of isopropyl alcohol. Shake well.
Spray the ink onto all the sections of hair that you want to dye red. With gloved hands, work the ink into every strand.
When you’ve done all those sections, cover them with plastic wrap and let the ink sit for about 10 minutes. Then, remove the plastic and let the hair dry for about an hour.
Rinse under warm water until the water runs clean. Repeat with the remaining hair, working with one color at a time.

, There are several things that you can use to create the furry or patterned arm bands worn by the Jellicles. Good options include:


Faux-fur trimmed, elbow length gloves. Cut the finger tips off so the top two-thirds of your fingers are exposed.
Furry arm bands
Animal-print pantyhose: cut the legs off so you have one band for each arm. Snip off the feet so you can slip them onto your arms, and trim them so they are forearm- or elbow-length

, The Jellicles also wear furry spats on the bottom of their legs, and you can replicate this with furry leg warmers.You can find these at costume shops, dance supply stores, accessory stores, or online.

, To make the tail, take a ball of yarn in the color you want your tail to be. Cut about 12 pieces of yarn that are each 63 inches (160 cm) long. This will yield a 25-inch tail, roughly. Lay them all out so they match up. Grab all the yarn ends on one side and tie them all into a loop. To make the tail:Divide the yarn pieces into three even groups and braid them together, leaving the final four inches free. Tie a knot in the end to secure the braid. If you like, decorate the tail by gluing extra pieces of yarn or strips of faux fur onto the tail.
To tie the braid to your body, measure the circumference of your waist. Double that number, then multiply that by 2.5.Cut another 12 pieces of yarn to that length. Tie a knot in one end and braid that yarn like you did before.
Slip the loop of the tail through this new braid and position it in the center of the longer braid. Position the tail at the bottom center of your back. Wrap the longer braid around your body twice and tie it in place at the back.

Start spending time in the woods at night.,
Sleep in blankets on the floor.,
Develop a strong bond with canines.,
Be territorial.,
Be moody.",How to Act Like a Werewolf1," Werewolves are drawn to the woods, to nature, and to being in the great outdoors. If you want to act like a werewolf, it’s a good idea to spend a considerable amount of time in the great outdoors, preferably at night. Get familiar with plants, animal tracks, and other essential survival skills.


Learn when the next full moon will occur on the lunar cycle and plan to be outside to stargaze in a werewolf habitat. Make sure you get permission before you leave the house in the middle of the night.
Get a guidebook of local plant life in your region and start learning to identify the local flora. Since werewolves spend so much time in the woods, it's a good idea to learn more about your surroundings.;
, Wolves are outdoor creatures, more comfortable and alert the closer to the ground they are. Act as if there’s just something uncomfortable about sleeping on your soft bed and create a little sleeping den in your bedroom on the floor.


Since really sleeping on the floor is kind of uncomfortable, line up some sleeping bags, blankets, and pillows to create a little mat on the ground, then build up pillow walls around the outside, like a fort. You could even get an inflatable camping sleep mat, if you want to invest.
When it’s time to go to bed, walk in three circles to burrow out a comfortable space in the blankets, then settle in by curling up into a ball.

, Start spending lots of time with your dog relatives will help you learn about their behavior to better mimic it, but it will also help you develop a strong emotional bond with dogs. If other people see dogs coming up to you familiarly, you’ll quickly get a reputation as a dog-person.


If you don’t have a family dog, the Humane Society is always open to volunteers who want to give shelter dogs walks, baths, and feedings. It can be a great way of bonding with animals who need a little bit of love.
Try to hang around big, wolf-like dogs. Siberian shepherds, German shepherds, and huskies are all good pets to observe to own your werewolf impression.

, Define your territory and mark it clearly. Whether it be your room, your yard, or your neighborhood, a good werewolf stakes some claim to a territory. Patrol your territory regularly and question anyone who comes in without being invited. Keep watch over what's yours.


Make a sign for your room, with a full moon and picture of a wolf howling, clearly labeled ""Stay out."" Post ""Beware of Werewolf"" signs on the door.
It's also a good idea to protect the people you care about. Your family and your close friends should be able to count on you at a moment's notice. Come through when they most need help. A werewolf should be reliable.

, Prowling the edges of the woods, howling at the moon: a werewolf is connected to dark, lunar energy. That doesn't mean a werewolf is ""bad,"" but that werewolves are connected to the unconscious feminine side of the psyche, as opposed to the conscious, thinking, controlling part. A werewolf should feel more and think less. Let your emotions guide your choices and your decisions. Go with your instincts, your gut reactions, and trust yourself. Be an animal."

Gather your materials.,
Inflate a balloon.,
Mix the paper mache.,
Tear up strips of newspaper.,
Apply the paper mache.,
Let it dry.,
Cut out the bottom.,
Create the sides.,
Cut out details.,
Paint the mask.,
Allow it to dry.",How to Make an Iron Man Mask2," To create a paper mache style mask, you'll need a balloon, newspaper, flour, a brush, red paint, gold paint, and cardboard scraps.

, The first step to many paper mache projects begins with the mold of a balloon. The balloon acts as a mold for the paper mache to be constructed around. Once you’ve inflated and tied it shut, tape the opening flap down to a table or solid work surface.


Taping the balloon will make it easier to work with., In a bowl, mix two cups of flour with two cups of water. Mix the mixture until it is creamy and smooth.You can also add salt to prevent mold growth.

, If you want, you could substitute newspaper for paper towels. Position your newspaper horizontally and cut three inch strips. Use scissors for a clean finish.

, Dip each strip in the flour mixture before placing onto the balloon. You could alternatively use a brush to apply your adhesive. Position a few strips then apply your glue with a brush.Cover the balloons entirety with the paper mache. The more strips you use to overlap the balloon, the stronger your mask will be.


If any clumps are leftover, evenly disperse it.
Make a mess and don't feel weird getting your hands dirty., Now you can go out and fix yourself a sandwich while the paper mache dries. Place a fan by the balloon for a faster drying time. This can take between 2 to 5 hours. Plan ahead of time. The paper mache needs to be completely dried before you can continue., Create a large hole on the bottom of the balloon to create an opening for the helmet. This is where you’ll put your head through, so make sure it is large enough to fit., To create a realistic looking Iron Man mask, you’ll need to remove the sides where your ears are. After cutting out the sides, cover the holes completely with masking tape. Don’t cover the opening for your head.This removes the wide curves of the balloon, and simulates a better looking mask shape.

, It might help having a photo of Iron Man’s mask at this point. You’ll need to cut out eye slits to see out of. You can also cut details out of the forehead like the real Iron Man mask. Go as detailed as you want. Make sure you detail everything before painting.You can also add sleek circles for ears. If you look at the mask, you’ll understand this detail.

, The easiest way to paint the mask is by using standard paint. Look at a familiar of Iron Man to understand the color combination. Spray paint will also work, but it'll take longer.

, Wait until the mask is completely dried from the paint job. Wearing a mask with wet paint could expose you to toxic chemicals. Once it is dried, you’re ready to showcase your mask to the world!

Print your research.,
Prepare the main parts.,
Paint the parts.,
Assemble the parts.",How to Make an Iron Man Mask3," Using cardboard is another easy way to build a potentially complex design. You’ll need a fair amount of sturdy and clean cardboard. You’ll also need scissors, glue, black markers, and red and gold paint.

, You’ll need to decide how detailed you want to make your mask. There are ways to create a practically realistic version of the mask, but it is a long and patient process. Print out pictures of the Iron Man mask, and also print out other people’s masks that you’re inspired by.

, Essentially there are two parts of the Iron Man mask: the red background and the gold plate on the front. These are the two parts of the mask you’ll need. If you want to create a more realistic mask, you’ll need to assemble the jaw line, ear piece, forehead, and more.


Trace out the gold front piece on a piece of cardboard before cutting and assembling.
Make sure the dimensions fit your face.

, After preparing the main components of the mask, you can paint them. For the foreground part of the mask, you’ll need to paint it red. For the front part of the mask, paint it gold.

, If you don’t want to fashion the red background, you could use a red cloth instead. Glue the two pieces together once the paint has dried. You now have the mask to look the part of a crime fighting super hero.

Stare down your enemies like a wolf.,
Move constantly.,
Sniff the wind regularly.,
Start running.,
Snarl.",How to Act Like a Werewolf2," Anyone who's ever looked a dog in the eye knows it's a hard staring contest to win. If you want to act like a werewolf, a good place to start is your alpha-wolf glare. If someone challenges you, never look away, or look down, and break their gaze. Stare straight back, as if you were trying to see behind their eyes, into their skull. Scrunch your eyebrows down to furrow your brow in a wolf-like manner.


Bring your chin to your chest to emphasize your eyes. Imagine you were wearing glasses and trying to look over them to give your glare a wolf-like aspect.

, Wolves are restless, shifty creatures. When you walk or sit, you should Try to exude a wolf-like energy. Make your movements fluid and sleek, walking on the balls of your feet, rather than your heels.


Don't walk, but stalk. Pretend that some prey has just appeared on the distant horizon, even if you're just walking to Jimmy John's.
Never stand still. If you're standing somewhere waiting, like at the doctor's office of the BMV, get up and pace around. Look like an animal in a cage trying to get out. Keep your head low and your motions sleek. A wolf moves around like a hunter. Think stealthy, sneaky, and quick. Don’t clomp around like Frankenstein’s monster.

, The sense-receptors of wolves are hundreds of times more sensitive than those in a human. To act like a wolf, practice using your smeller more actively as a way of experiencing the world. Wolves use scent to track prey, mark territory, and as a way of identifying other creatures.Occasionally, when you're standing around with friends and the wind blows, turn your nose to it and sniff gently, as if you smell danger coming.
Become a connoisseur of smells, particularly the outdoor variety. Practice walking around the woods and identifying fragrances. Be able to tell jasmine from lilac from deer poop.

, Wolves are efficient and fast runners, conserving their energy by trotting after their prey at a quick lope until within striking distance, at which point they kick things into high gear. To get more wolf-like, start running and feel the wind in your fur. Er, your hair. The wind in your hair.


For more of a werewolf-like experience, head to the woods and do some trail running, and consider investing in some ""naked"" running shoes to get closer to the earth.

, Werewolves don't speak, they snarl. It's a good idea to start communicating in grunts, snarls, and barks, especially when you're frustrated (or just feeling goofy). Caught in the middle of a stare down? Slowly let your voice rumble from your throat, quietly, getting gradually louder as the stare-down continues. When your enemy breaks, pipe down.

Grow out the hair on your head and other places if you want to give yourself a were-vibe.


Even if you're not the hairiest, growing out your hair and learning to tease it and tangle it can help you cultivate a werewolf-like appearance. Go to bed after washing your hair and let it dry overnight. When you wake up, you'll have a werewolf-do.

, Long and sharp fingernails are a sure sign of a werewolf. Grow them out and keep them strong with clear or dark reinforcing nail polish, and keep them filed so they won't grow raggedy. Keep them rounded, or pointy, depending on how far you want to take your impression.

, While a werewolf usually rips out of their clothes upon transformation, you can cultivate a werewolf-like wardrobe by dressing in earthy colors, dark tones, and natural fibers. Wear sizes that are a bit larger than you might normally wear to give yourself room to transform, without shredding your clothes up. Also, you can't go wrong with a good wolf-howling-at-the-moon t-shirt.


Forest green, black, and brown are the color schemes of the werewolf. Avoid bright neon colors and pastels.
Cotton, wool, and natural hemp fibers would all work well in your clothes. Avoid silky shirts and artificial fabrics, like polyester.

, The clothes of the werewolf should look lived-in, worked out, and as if they've seen some wear. Jeans with rips and tears in the knee? Perfect. Old flannel work shirts with holey elbows? Even better. Outdoorsy clothes should look like they've been beat up, not like they just came off the rack.


It's a lot cheaper and more accurate to buy used clothes, so you don't have to worry about distressing them yourself. Hit up second-hand stores in your town to find good used work-shirts on the cheap. Grass stains included.
If you want to take your werewolf impression to the next level, roll around in the grass to get some dry-dirt and grass stains on your jeans and your shirt. Maybe stick a leaf and a twig or two in your hair. You'll look like you sleep outside and spend the night running through the woods.

, No high heels or silly flip-flops for the werewolf. You've got to look like you're ready to go clomping around the woods, scrambling over rocky precipices and waterfalls at the drop of a hat. Wear chunky, practical shoes that will allow you to off-road in the great outdoors. Dark boots, hiking shoes, and other waterproof gear is all great for the werewolf.


Sandals like Chocos, Tevas, Birkenstocks, or other outdoorsy sandals would also be appropriate for the budding werewolf.

Dress the part.,
Look the part.,
Accessorize!",How to Act Like Serah Farron," Serah is mature and shows a lot of wisdom for her age. Be sure to try to be like that too. Also And also she cares about the ones that she loves. Basically, Serah is wise, mature, considerate, and kind.;
, Serah wears a red pleated skirt lined with black lace, a white sleeveless dress shirt, a semi-transparent sweeper in the same style of the shirt, black thigh-highs, ivory ankle boots, and a bandage on her left bicep which she uses to cover her l'Cie brand. In the Winter, you can wear a long sleeved dress shirt, a long jacket, leggings, and any kind of boots. In the summer, you can wear sneakers or flip flops and you don't have to wear thigh-highs/leggings. You can add the bandage to get that full Serah effect.

, Serah has the same pink tint of hair that Lightning has, which she ties into a ponytail on the left side of her head, much like how Lightning's hair falls over her left shoulder. To get this hairstyle, you can look at a video on YouTube or just take a picture of Serah to a hairdresser. Serah is skinny and has very clear skin. You should try to exercise daily by doing 100 crunches and running/dancing for 45 min. You can gradually increase how many crunches and how many minutes you run/dance when you get use to it.

Observe your cat.Hiss at it.,
Swim...a lot.,
Protect your territory.,
Stay fit.,
Wear tiger related clothing.,
Follow through with your plans.",How to Act Like a Tiger," See what it does. Playfully hit it. See what it does again. Watch for other behaviors too. Relate these actions to things that might happen to you. (e.g. Someone is bothering you, and you hiss or some one is mad at you, walk away or hiss, etc.);
, Tigers favor water more than any other big cat. If you seriously flat out can't swim, it's no big deal. But it's best if you want to really prove you have tiger in you. When swimming, you might want to throw some object in the pool and jump on top of it (which relates to hunting fish).

, If someone you dislike comes in your territory, roar or growl at them. If someone you don't know comes in, curiously inspect them. If they seem nice, let them in. If you sense danger,chase them out.

, Tigers are strong animals, so you need to keep in shape. Get strong, and exercise a lot so that you will have endurance, speed, and strength.

, This is entirely optional. You can wear tiger striped shirts if you want, but you really don't have to. If you know what a furry is, and you want to wear a furry costume, then go ahead, because that's a great choice. There are many furries around. Most people who want to release an inner animal actually are furries! If you can't acquire a costume or tiger-related clothing, just wear some orange-white clothes.

, Your friends might think you're crazy, but that's okay. If your clan members or friends think something is wrong with you, then just explain to them what you are doing. If they are a good friend, they will understand. Also,if someone else is being dominant and being leader,roar at them to tell them they are acting like a wolf,not tiger.

Be courageous.,
Be selfless.,
Be an explorer.,
Be physically fit.,
Be prepared.,
Learn how to defend yourself.,
Remember that while not everybody can save Hyrule, everyone can make a difference.",How to Act Like Link from Legend of Zelda," Link is the holder of the Triforce of Courage, so first and foremost, you must always follow your heart and do what you know to be right, even if it's the harder thing to do, even if you're surrounded by monsters, have half a heart left and Navi won't stop shouting in your face.;
, Don't expect payment for everything you do, and do things to help others, not yourself. Put yourself out there and go outside your comfort zone to help others.

, Half the fun of a Zelda game is all the extras you discover. New lands to be discovered, new friends to be made—always be on the lookout for a new experience.

, Princesses don't rescue themselves, and it's hard work being a hero! Know how to defend yourself, and take good care of your body. Lift weights, run, and get into gymnastics. It takes a lot of practice, but it's worth it for a healthier life (and to be like Link).

, While Link may go a little overboard, what with three Bomb Bags, a Boomerang, and a Fishing Pole, always know what you are getting into and be prepared for whatever may arise.

, If you want to help others, first you need to know how to help yourself. You can't do any princess-saving if you get stuck in the first dungeon.

, Just because you're not really out there fighting monsters and saving lives doesn't mean that you can't really help people. Be kind to everyone, and know that even the smallest things make a difference.

Start reading up.,
You know how StarClan cats give prophecies?,
Start with simple prophecies, not like the professional ones that Spottedleaf gives, and make them easy to fulfill unless you're trying to do a professional clan.,
Read books that are mainly about StarClan, and look for details about StarClan.,
Don't forget, you don't have to always do prophecy-related stuff.,
Get a warrior name and Clan.,
Don't use a ridiculous warrior names like Grabbypan or Collarbiter.,
StarClan cats usually have small stars in their fur.,
Don't say shortcut words like ""I'll, Don't, C'mon,"" and all that stuff.,
Always speak kind, loyal, and mysteriously.,
Don't EVER speak TwolegSpeak!",How to Act Like a Starclan Cat," You can't be a StarClan cat correctly unless you know what they do.;
, Start giving strange mysterious prophecies that you will later fulfill or you will plan for a friend or family member to fulfill. Or the person can do it. You can trick them into doing it.

, Don't make it all unrealistic.

, Use these details and do whatever the StarClan cats do in the stories.

, You can just talk mysteriously like a StarClan cat or tell stories about your former Clan and how they are doing now. Of course to do that you will need a Clan.

, There are many resources you can get a warrior name from, and you can either choose a Clan or take the Clan quiz at warriors.com.

, Read some books and notice that cats usually have nature-related names and many warriors have ""claw"" or ""pelt"" as a last name, also see that medicine cats usually don't have ""claw"" in their last names, contrary to a warrior's name. Learn what names are appropriate or not, and what would be odd to put in a name. For example, 'Humanheart' would be inappropriate because the cats don't exactly know what a human is, instead they would use the term 'two-leg' but this name is also highly unrecommended. Don't make your name like a website username like Mangalover or Horseys101. That isn't a real warrior name, and people would think you were talking about some virtual game or something. Choose the name you like, not the one you don't like but the website chose for you.

, Draw a picture of the cat and visualize the cat with stars in his\her fur if you want, because when people ask ""What does your cat look like?"" if you don't describe the stars then people will think the cat isn't a StarClan cat.

, You need to say stuff like ""You cannot defeat BloodClan unless you have the right power in your Soul, Firestar.""

, If you are evil, you can always create a dark forest cat..

, Then other cats will think you are a Werecat!

There is no death, there is the Force.;
, The Jedi seem very arrogant on the surface, but this is because they notice things which others don't, and they learn to keep their mouths shut. Train your senses to perceive things which most people overlook, then learn to hint at them without actually telling people.

, The Jedi are deeply spiritual, they feel and move in the Force. Recognizing that there is a higher order is key to seeming Jedi.

Read over the play.,
Learn more about the character.,
Get into character.,
Read your lines.,
Add actions.,
Sleep on it.,
Memorize your lines.,
Act and Learn.,
Rehearse.,
Have fun.",How to Act in a Play," Before you begin acting, at least read through a few scenes to get a feel on what the play is about. Figure out the genre, and who are the protagonist and antagonist. Try to understand the story line and the meaning of the play.;
, If it is a well known play, try finding character profiles online or their insights and past. Some sites may even tell you why they do things and how their mind works. Learn as much as you possibly can about the character.

, Now that you know more about the character, get into their shoes. If you can, tell your friends about it, and practice having a conversation or doing things as if you were the character. Talk like they would, walk like the would, watch the shows they would, and do the things they would. In every situation, be your character.

, Once you get used to your character, read over the lines. Read the other characters lines in your head, and read your lines out loud. Think about how fast or slow they would say it, and add stops if you think it is needed. Be the character and imagine you are in the story. Breathe the air, watch the grass...or maybe you are in the middle of a war scene...maybe even in the middle of a mystery. Be part of it.

, Stand up, memorize a couple lines and practice moving with it. If the play doesn't tell you what actions to do, do what you think the character would do. You are now the character. If he would hold his head while screaming, do that! If he is very clumsy, imagine you were speaking with a friend, and then trip in the middle of the conversation. Do what needs to be done.

, Don't take in too much at the same time. Do one or two scenes a day and work on it. When you sleep, you may think of better ways to say or do something, so use this quiet time to review your acting.

, Before all the cast members come together to practice, be sure you know your lines for that day. During practice, you want to make sure you work more on your acting then just reading off the book. If you are reading, your hands and eyes are occupied, so learn ahead of time.

, Be confident or not. Whatever your character is supposed to be. If you must, practice being in character an hour before practice or the show. During practice, be sure your actions work well with your other cast members. Unless it is a one-man-play, listen to their input. They may have better ideas and even ways to improve your actions. Take this to heart. If you must, ask multiple people what you should do. Remember, the play is for the audience, so do what makes most people happy.

, Once you got your lines and actions down, practice. Practice as often as possible. Recite your dialogues in your head, and practice articulation and projection. See if you can get your costumes ahead of time and practice in them to get more comfortable.

, Unless this is Broadway, enjoy the practices and the mess ups. No one will be perfect the first time or on the first day. Go out with your cast members for a meal or games and get closer. Plays turn out better when everyone is comfortable around each other, so mingle and have fun.

Be born into the noble class.,
Be born male.,
Learn from your parents what it means to be a knight.,
Become a page.,
Become a squire.,
Be invested as a knight.",How to Be a Knight1," In the feudal era, the opportunity to become a knight was, in practice, restricted to the nobility, as it was they who usually had the wealth necessary to own and maintain the horse, armor, and weapons that knights needed to defend their lords’ lands.A family could be made a member of the nobility (ennobled) by the king if one of its members performed an outstanding service worthy of a knight.;
, While in modern times, both men and women can be knighted, historically only men were knighted as a matter of course. In fact, the word “knight” derives from the Anglo-Saxon word “cniht,” meaning “boy.” There were exceptions, however.


In 1149, the Order of the Hatchet was created to honor the women of the town of Tortosa in Catalonia (Spain), who dressed as men to repel the Moors who had invaded their town. They were made the equivalent of knights.The legends of Charlemagne do note the adventures of a female knight named Bradamante (Bradamant), who was Charlemagne’s niece. However, Bradamante initially posed as a male until meeting and falling in love with Rogero (Ruggiero)., For the first seven years of his life, a boy would learn the manners required of a knight from his parents, who told him stories of chivalrous deeds and took him to tournaments. Play time involved taking up a wooden sword and shield against imagined enemies of the liege lord.

, At age 7, a boy would become a page (also called a varlet, meaning “little vassal”) in the service of a noble and any ladies of the court who resided under the noble’s roof. He would be dressed in the lord’s colors and placed under the older pages in the lord’s service. As a page, his service would be divided among household duties, physical activities, and education.


Household duties included serving as waiter and busboy at the lord’s table, maintaining the lord’s clothes and helping him dress. This included helping the lord into and out of his armor at jousting tournaments.
Physical activities included learning to ride and hunt, both with arms and with a hawk or falcon. The swordplay he practiced under his parents’ roof would become more formalized, and the page would also learn how to joust by holding a lance while riding a wheeled hobby horse pulled by two other pages toward a target.
Education built on the manners training the page received from his parents, and also included religious training and developing thinking skills through games such as chess and backgammon.
The more wealthy the noble, the greater the prestige associated with serving as a page to him. However, the more wealthy the noble, the more pages he had and the greater the competition among the pages for status within the noble’s house. , Usually at age 14, but sometimes as young as age 10,, a page would be apprenticed to a specific knight as his armiger or squire, from the French “escuyer” for “shield bearer.” In this role, the knight-in-training was regarded as a young man and so had greater duties, responsibilities, and expectations than when he was a page.


The household duties of waiting at table on the lord of the manor were now transferred to assisting his knight in similar fashion. The squire also helped his knight into his armor and maintained it, assisting him both at tournaments and in battle, and saw to the care of the knight’s horse. A squire who assisted the lord of the manor in this fashion was known as the “squire of the body” and was considered the highest ranking of all the squires of the manor.Swordplay with wooden swords and lance-play on a hobby horse were now replaced with real weapons. Squires also had to learn to swim and climb to be able to storm a castle.
Manners lessons included learning the code of chivalry (conduct in battle and regard for those the knight served to protect)as well as music and dancing. Squires also learned the art of heraldry, the symbols for their own and other noble houses so they could tell friend from foe on the field.

, Assuming the squire showed himself worthy of his lessons, at age 21, he would be dubbed a knight. (In some cases, such as particular valor in combat, he might receive the honor sooner, much as battlefield promotions are accorded today, and with only a brief ritual dubbing.)The formal knighting ceremony was highly ritualized and involved the following steps:


A night vigil in the chapel of the castle whose lord the knight-to-be would represent, including a ritual bath to symbolically purify the candidate. The candidate was clad in a white vestment to represent purity, covered with a red robe to represent nobility. On his feet and legs were black shoes and stockings to represent that he would give his life in the service of his lord and chivalry if need be. The sword and shield the knight would wield would be placed on the chapel altar, while the candidate knelt or stood before it in silent prayer for a period of 10 hours.
In the morning, a Mass was held with a sermon on the duties of the knight. At this point, the knight-to-be’s friends and family were in attendance. The priest then blessed the sword and shield and handed them to the knight’s sponsor, who then passed them to the lord who would conduct the ceremony. This might be the lord of the manor, a greater noble, or even the king. .(By the time of Henry VIII, only the reigning monarch conferred knighthood.)Two sponsors presented the knight to the presiding lord, in whose presence the knight swore an oath of allegiance and vows to shun traitors, to treat women with the greatest respect, and to observe all the rituals of the Church. The presiding lord then presented the knight with the sword and shield and touched him on the shoulder with either the flat of the sword or the flat of his hand, saying, “I dub thee Sir <the knight’s name>.” The sponsors then put the sword and its scabbard around the knight’s waist and spurs on his heels, at which time the knight could use the title “Sir” himself.Becoming a knight required being able to afford the expenses associated with the honor. Those squires who could not afford it were called “arma patrina” and were allowed to carry a lance and shield, but did not have any of the other accoutrement of knighthood.The ""Squire of the Body"" often accompanied the knight onto the field of battle, where he would, at a distance, hold and maintain the knights spare accoutrement. If the knight fell in battle, the Squire of the Body would take up a weapon and protect his knight's body. Should the squire prevail over an assailing knight, he had the right to take the horse, shield, armor and sword from the knight he defeated. That would then become his armorial, and he would automatically assume the knighthood of his vanquished.

Be outstanding in your field.,
Be a citizen of the United Kingdom.,
Be invested as a knight.",How to Be a Knight2," While medieval knighthood was an award for military merit, modern knighthood in the United Kingdom is awarded for outstanding achievement in one’s field of endeavor, whether it be business and industry, education, the sciences, religion, or entertainment.


There are actually five levels of honor for men and women in the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire: Knight/Dame Grand Cross (GBE), Knight/Dame Commander (KBE), Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE), Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire(OBE), and Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (MBE). Only the first two allow their recipients to use an honorific before their name., Medieval knighthood was accorded only to men, but modern knighthood can be accorded to both men and women, who are called “Dame” instead of “Sir.” However, to be able to be called either “Sir” or “Dame,” you must be a British citizen.


Non-citizens cannot be knighted, but they can receive honorary knighthoods on the recommendation of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. They do not undergo the knighthood ceremony, and they may not use the title associated with becoming a knight or dame, although they may use the initials of the order after their names as knighted citizens do. If they should later become British citizens, they can then seek the full honors of knighthood., Investiture may be either public or private and includes a ceremonial dubbing by the reigning monarch or a member of the royal family acting on the monarch’s behalf. This is followed by the presentation of insignia.


Unlike medieval knighthood, modern knighthood carries no military obligation to the Crown.
Clergy who are knighted are not dubbed, as the use of a sword is not considered appropriate to their calling. They also do not use the title associated with becoming a knight or dame."

Obey the governing laws of the SCA and your kingdom and barony within it.,
Respect your leaders.,
Participate in SCA events.,
Display behavior befitting a knight of the realm.,
Acquit yourself well in combat.,
Be knighted by your monarch upon the recommendation of existing knights.",How to Be a Knight3," The purpose of the SCA is to educate and entertain its members and others by recreating various aspects of medieval society, ranging from the mundane to man-to-man combat. As a member of the SCA, you are subject to its laws as well as those of the regional group (kingdom) and local group (barony, canton, college, or shire) within it to which you belong to ensure order, just as medieval knights were subject to the laws of their kingdoms to ensure order within them. Just as medieval knights were seen as exemplars of the laws to which they were subject, so will you be as a knight within the organization.

, Regional groups/kingdoms are led by a king and queen, while smaller groups within a kingdom are led by a seneschal. You need to show these people the respect they’re due by virtue of their position; if you do become a knight, you’ll have to take an oath of fealty (allegiance) to them.

, If you expect to become a knight in the SCA, then you need to take part in SCA events. You don’t have to attend every event, but you should try a number of different activities and find the ones you do best. You will have to compete in tournaments, but you shouldn’t restrict your activities to them. Participation also includes doing the following:


Dress the part of your persona to the best of your ability. You don’t have to be perfectly authentic, but you can and should do a reasonable job, and you can always ask for help if you need it.
Share your expertise with others and be willing to learn from them in return. If you have knowledge or skills that your fellow members can benefit from, share them. Likewise, be willing to learn what your fellow members have to teach you; you may pick up both a new skill and a new friend.
Share your resources with others as you can afford to. Called “hospitality,” this means lending your time and talents to help other members out apart from teaching. This could be as simple as lending your sword to someone who’s broken his or as complex as organizing an event.

, Not only must you treat your leaders with courtesy and respect, but your fellow members as well and, if taking part in a tournament, your opponents. Your persona may be part of a culture that isn’t noted for courteous behavior, but you can’t use it as an excuse for behaving badly at events. (The comic strip character Prince Valiant was of Norse blood, but he acted in a manner befitting a knight of King Arthur’s court, not as a Viking raider might.)


The one form of courtesy you’ll be expected to practice as a knight and should be practicing before you become one is to uphold the honor of your consort. (The SCA confers knighthood to both men and women; your consort is your significant other.) You wear a token, or favor, identifying your consort when you compete in a tournament; your actions in the tournament reflect not only upon you, but upon your consort, as well.
You can, however, inject those elements of your persona that fit into a display of courtesy, such as removing your feathered hat with a flourish when your Italian fencer bows before the queen.

, You should develop your combat skills in tournaments to the point where you can reasonably stand against any of your opponents, regardless of whether you win or not.

, Most kingdoms have a council of knights who advise the monarch as to the fitness of prospective candidates for knighthood. Getting to know these people can help you in your quest, but it is ultimately the monarch who decides.Although the best known, the SCA is not the only organization that re-enacts medieval history. Other such organizations may or may not offer the opportunity to earn knighthood; those that do presumably have standards similar to the SCA’s.
Whichever organization you belong to, you’ll find it best to focus more on the journey to knighthood than on the goal of becoming a knight. Spend more time honoring others and less worrying about when the honors will come your way.

Earn the title through life achievement.,
Join a religious or civic organization.,
Buy the title.,
Join an organization that promotes the ideals of chivalry in the modern world.",How to Be a Knight4," This knight does not carry the GBE or KBE appendage. This title is for men only, and is appended John Jones, kt. This is known as the Knights Bachelor and is the most junior of the order for men. It is the lowest rank of the knighted male. A woman given this honor will actually carry the Dame Jane Jones, DBE title, Dame Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, because this is the most junior of the order for women., For religious organizations such as the Knights of Columbus, they even say ""serve the Lord, get a sword"" (and then they offer you pretty epic insurance.) Besides the KofC, there are a surpringly large number of organizations that feature “Knight” in their names or as a title that can be earned by rising through the organization’s ranks.

, It’s possible to gain the title of “knight” simply by paying a membership fee in some organizations or signing up for a reward program that includes the title “knight.”

, Some social organizations, such as the International Fellowship of Chivalry-Now, devote themselves to fostering the ideals of chivalrous behavior in their daily lives, as opposed to having their members to dress in armor and swing maces at each other. "

Be protective of your family.,
Be regal.,

Always remember to be polite.,
Be reserved.,
Be independent.,
Avoid acting out negative emotions.,
Work on developing a good singing voice.,
Pretend to have ice powers.",How to Act and Look Like Elsa from Frozen1," Elsa is very protective of her younger sister Anna, and these feelings are a primary motivation for her character. If you have a younger sibling or siblings, be sure to always keep them out of harm's way.


Don't ever let your words or actions hurt your sibling. Elsa may have accidentally hurt Anna with her ice powers, but she would never do anything to intentionally harm her. To be like Elsa, you should never insult or hit your younger sibling. Speak in a gentle, kind manner.
Protect your younger sibling from bullying. If you see him or her getting pushed around, step in and tell the bully off. If you aren't around when the bullying happens, encourage your sibling to tell an adult. Be supportive and reassure him or her that the bully is in the wrong.If you think your sibling may be hanging out with a bad crowd, talk to him or her about finding more positive friends.
Be a positive role model for your sibling to follow. A younger sibling is likely to want to be more like you and may copy your actions. Lead by example with positive behaviour and respect.Remember that sisters tend to have a positive effect on their siblings, making them less likely to feel lonely or self-conscious.Foster a good relationship with your sibling by always being there to support him or her.
If you don't have a younger sibling, you can play this role with a younger cousin, a smaller friend, or even a pet.;
, Remember that Elsa typically acts like the proper queen that she is. In contrast to her younger sister, Elsa displays a lot of grace and poise., Try your best to always be respectful of others and to follow proper etiquette. A major part of being regal is showing people respect. Be humble and show gratitude to others. Never pick petty fights.
Practice good posture. Keep your back straight and never slouch. Always keep your shoulders back and your chin up. Hold your head high. A good way to help you maintain good posture is to pretend to carry an item on your head without letting it fall off. A classic way to practice at home is to walk with a book balanced on top of your head., Because Elsa had to hide her magical powers for most of her life, she is used to concealing who she is and how she feels. While you should never be afraid to show people your true self, you can be like Elsa by being quiet and occasionally secretive.


Remember that by the end of the film, Elsa begins to find a happy medium between being completely detached and overwhelmed by her emotions.

, Because of her powers, Elsa spent most of her life in isolation and as a result is independent to a fault. Don't go to this extreme, but if you want to be like Elsa, you should try to be independent. Learn how to take care of yourself and enjoy time spent alone.


Learn to create your own fun without needing other people around. Take up a solitary hobby like art to occupy your time. Instead of only reading books assigned to you at school, check some out from your library. Explore new ideas on your own. Be creative!
Get a job if you're old enough. Having your own source of income will let you take care of more things, like buying food and clothing, without help.If you're too young to work, ask your parents about volunteering. You can develop your independence while helping others.

, Always be mindful of how you treat others, especially your loved ones. While you should be in touch with your emotions, anger is never an excuse to hurt anyone. The major conflict in Frozen is caused by Elsa letting her emotions overwhelm her and accidentally hurting her sister with her powers. No matter how angry someone makes you feel, never lash out with violence or hurtful words. When you start to feel angry or frustrated, try one or more tricks to calm yourself down:


The best way to combat anger is through mindfulness. When you feel yourself start to get upset, try to pause and count to ten. Think about why you're getting angry and whether there's a more positive way to react to the situation.
Talk to a friend or an adult about your feelings. Explaining your emotions with another person will help to diffuse them.If you can't talk to someone immediately, try writing everything out in a journal.
Distract yourself to keep from dwelling on whatever is making you upset. You can listen to music, watch TV, read a book, or engage in your favourite hobby.
A positive way to diffuse all that energy that gets pent up when you're angry is to exercise. Going for a run is a great way to improve your mood.Remember to apologise if your temper does get the better of you. Be sincere and try to make things right., A major part of Elsa's popularity as a character comes from her powerful singing throughout the film. Her solo song ""Let It Go"" has been an especially big hit and actually made the creators of Frozen decide to change Elsa from a villain to a flawed hero., This is an aspect of Elsa that you will really need to use your imagination for. Try to make the cold seem like your element.


When the weather starts to get chilly, keep wearing your summer clothes a little longer than everyone else.
No matter how bad the weather gets, never complain about the cold. Instead, pretend you don't feel cold at all and talk about how much you love the winter.
Keep your room a little cooler than average.
Take up skating or another ice-related activity and talk about how you feel at home with the ice.
Be careful not to let yourself get too cold, or you can hurt yourself or become very ill."

Wear your hair like Elsa's.,
Dress like Elsa.,
Do your makeup like Elsa's.,
Aim for pale skin.,
Make a point of wearing gloves often.",How to Act and Look Like Elsa from Frozen2," Unlike many animated characters, Elsa sports a few different hairstyles. Choose from any of these looks:


At her coronation, Elsa wears her hair in an elegant updo that is essentially a braid twisted up into a bun. Instead of tucking her bangs into the bun, she wears them straight and forward.
The hairstyle Elsa is depicted as wearing most is part of her ""Snow Queen"" look and is essentially her coronation bun undone. This hairstyle consists of a simple fishtail braid that falls forward over her left shoulder and slicked-back bangs. Be sure to volumize your hair at the crown with a little gentle teasing. This hairstyle looks more relaxed compared to her coronation updo and is much fluffier.
When Elsa was a child, she wore her hair similarly to how she does in her Snow Queen look. The major differences are that when she was a child she wore her braid with a blue headband and bangs and let it fall to her back.
In the short Frozen Fever, Elsa alternates her Snow Queen hair with pink flower barrettes, plus a purple, snowflake-embellished flower accessory to the right of her hair.
The main thing about Elsa's hair to remember is that it is a very light, almost white platinum blonde. If this isn't your natural hair colour, you could optionally achieve it with one or more treatments with bleach, maybe wear a similar wig. However, Elsa could have had a naturally darker hair colour, like her parents, if she didn't have her ice powers. As long as the hairstyle gives some idea of Elsa, any hair colour will be more or less fine.

, Elsa wears a few different costumes you can choose to follow. You may decide to copy these outfits exactly for a costume or simply create an Elsa-inspired wardrobe using the same colour palettes.


The main outfit most people associate with Elsa is her ""Snow Queen"" dress. It is a glittery strapless dress that is light blue in colour. She accessorises with a sheer icy blue sleeved cape decorated with snowflakes over her dress and a pair of matching pale blue heels.
Elsa's other main outfit is the one she wore for her coronation. It consists of a floor-length teal bodice dress over a black long-sleeved top with matching teal gloves and a regal purple-leaning magenta cape.A more recent and lesser-known look Elsa has sported is the one she had in the animated short Frozen Fever. It is very similar to her Snow Queen outfit but replaces the aqua blue tones with emerald greens. Instead of snowflakes, her cape is accented with leaves and pink flowers. This is a good choice if you want a more spring or summer-themed outfit whilst still looking like Elsa., Part of Elsa's distinct look is her makeup style. While bold, her makeup is relatively simple and can be done as part of your everyday routine.


Elsa wears quite heavy makeup around her eyes. She wears a solid lavender eyeshadow across her entire lid. She also creates an almost smoky look with black mascara and eyeliner.
As an adult, Elsa always wears bright magenta lip colour.
Elsa's eyebrows are a much darker shade compared to her icy hair. If you are a natural platinum blonde with equally light eyebrows, try darkening them using a honey or tan eyebrow pencil.
While likely natural, Elsa has pale pink, rosy cheeks that you can match with a little bit of blush.
Elsa's eyeshadow in Frozen Fever is more of a gentle pink or magenta, similar to her lipstick. Her makeup in the short film is lighter than it appears in Frozen, opposed to her sister Anna, who wore very little or no makeup in Frozen, and more than usual on her birthday in ""Frozen Fever"".

, Like her hair, Elsa's skin is quite pale to match her icy magical powers. Try not to get too much sun and always remember to use sunscreen.

Remember that not everyone can have pale skin. If your skin is dark, don't use chemicals and substances to make it unnaturally pale. You and your costume will be just as beautiful.

, While trying to keep her ice powers under control and a secret, Elsa's parents made her wear gloves.You can wear gloves, ideally, silky and thin ones to either pretend you're hiding magical powers of your own or simply copy Elsa's look from earlier on in the film. A pair of gloves will especially stand out if you pair them with warmer weather clothing.


Keep in mind that people may find you constantly wearing gloves to be a bit odd!
Remember that Elsa gives up this practice once her secret is out.

"
"
Dress in old-fashioned clothing.,
Have a collection of ""things that work"" - You want your clothes to be serviceable and designed to last (You assume that you're going to outlive the lifetime guarantee on most things), whichever era it's from.,
Act like you have many secrets.,
Seem to have been there.,
Become familiar with classical music.,
Take hospitality seriously.,
Develop a slight accent.,
Improve your vocabulary.,
Take up hobbies from eras long past.,
Be mature.,
Read books from many historical eras.,
Take up calligraphy.,
Write letters by hand.,
Develop a profound fascination with art and architecture from across all different ages.,
Keep your distance.,
Be good with animals.",How to Act Immortal (Cosplay)," The exact era does not matter, but the quality is very important. A subtle Victorian fashion is ideal for giving the impression that you've already been around for some time. You can find little pieces of Victorian style garb at thrift stores like Goodwill, or you could always buy online. Don't forget to use your creativity to vamp up clothing in the Victorian style – think lace, brooches, brocade, velvet, etc.


Look for vintage brooches, particularly cameos. They can go on sweaters, dresses, and more to give the impression of an earlier age.






Sweaters and shawls are great, because they look old-fashioned and they match perfectly with vintage brooches.






Wear older style dresses and frocks.






Don't forget your old-fashioned modesty! People of your time didn't wear super-tight tank tops or skimpy little cut-off shorts. Why, back in previous centuries, baring your ankles was unheard of! Of course, after living through different eras, you've probably modernized a bit, so it's no big deal to wear a skirt that reaches your knees rather than your ankles, or to wear a top that doesn't touch your collarbones; just remember to dress somewhat modestly.





;
, Your clothes should be the best examples of their type, however old they are - If you bought a good suit in 1930, you could still be wearing it now, likewise your car, or your bureau. This ties into the idea of refined taste - What you knew you enjoyed ninety years ago is still something you can enjoy now, regardless of modern fashion.

, Leave around some ""accidental"" clues so people will believe you are lying about where you are at night. Then, deny it half-believably, but not so well that they will actually believe you. Slight suspicion is the key.

, Brush up on your history or, at the very least, get a wistful look in your eye when somebody brings it up. Try working extra hard for a history test about the place and time you were born. If your teacher asks you something and you really don't know the answer, just say that you’d prefer not to talk about it. Or, if you think you know but make a mistake, act slightly confused when the teacher corrects you. (You might even throw in a line about how history is written by the victors.)

, Mozart, Tchaikovsky, Beethoven, Chopin, Bach... all the greats. It's impressive and unusual when a young person has an intimate familiarity with music from eras long before his or her own, so people will most likely pay quite a bit of notice to your extensive (and uncommon) interest.


Couple this interest with clear and verifiable knowledge about the composers. Depending on how good you are at storytelling, you might even like to sprinkle your conversation with anecdotes about ""the time that Mozart did X."" Keep in mind that there’s a huge difference between dropping a ""that one time Mozart…"" and a ""that one time 'Wolfgang and I…”

, When you entertain guests, do it properly - Invite people around for supper, have a few decanters at the ready, be willing to play parlor games.


Pursuant to this, learn to cook. Your simple, comfort foods will be cheap things made from leftovers - Cold roast sandwiches, soups made from dried stores. Try not to be too dependent on the fridge and freezer - you might store potatoes in the cellar, but the concept of frozen fish is a convenient novelty rather than a staple.
Know your spirits, and know when to serve tea. Sometimes, your guests will want a refreshing gin and tonic on a hot afternoon, sometimes they'll be arriving for the night out of a bitter snowstorm and need a stirrup cup as soon as they get out of their overcoats. Provide, be generous, and make them feel welcome.
Good manners are timeless. Don't make a show of hospitality, just be genuinely welcoming and accommodating. Putting your guests on edge by insisting on formal protocol when it's not needed isn't going to make you seem ageless, it's going to make you seem immature.

, As an immortal, you may very well be an immigrant; a subtle 'accent' will show this. If you're American, try to add a slight British or French speech pattern to your pronunciation. Pronounce your vowels slightly differently and try your best to subtly imitate an aristocrat in your speech. Alternatively, use the next step to make your English sound old-fashioned.


Remember that you aren't necessarily going to be an aristocrat. Not everyone in the past was posh, most people were just ordinary people.
Talk fondly but vaguely about where you grew up; Sometimes drift into melancholy at the fact that you can never go back. Even without revolutions, wars and political sea-changes, the character of most of the world has change over the past hundred years. What had once been your gamekeeper's house is now probably an outward-bound holiday center. Your lovable young grandson is buried in the churchyard, along with his wife, and their sons, and their sons. Time has moved on, and you've been left behind.

, As an immortal who has seen much of the world, you most likely know and use a lot of uncommon words and phrases. Reading classic literature will help you to become familiar with terms that are less common in modern speech. (Ex. Shakespeare coined words like ""ghastly"" and ""tongue-tied"" as well as phrases like ""All that glitters is not gold."") Incorporating obscure, complicated words and phrases into your speech will make you seem wiser and, therefore, older, depending on where you live.


Consider studying Old and Middle English. These originating forms of modern English contain wonderful words and phrases that you can use. They're fun to learn, they increase your understanding of English grammar and they're historically useful, enabling you to read old English texts such as Beowulf in the original English.

, Hobbies that have less appeal today but were once thriving are excellent ones to take up and learn, and the more intricate and labor-intensive, the more likely that your skills will astonish people. Think about hobbies such as lace-making, tatting, building exquisite wooden toys in the Victorian style, embroidering wall tapestries, etc. In addition, a number of hobbies that have a fresh revival can also be relied upon but take an old-fashioned slant on them rather than the more modern versions, with such hobbies as knitting, taxidermy, and tatting.


Sports hobbies that were once very popular but are less so now include badminton, croquet, and side-saddle riding. For sports such as tennis, resort to wearing older style fashions and playing only on grass courts. Hold garden parties with badminton and croquet as major forms of entertainment; movies like Merchant Ivory's ""Room with a View"" will help give you a good sense of such events in the past.






Prefer card and board games over video and electronic games. Hunt through antique or secondhand stores and look for original versions of board games (with wooden, Bakelite, and glass pieces), chess sets, and cards, etc.







, If you want it to seem that you have lived through many ages, behaving in a mature fashion is a must. You have seen many things and learned a great deal, so aim to present an aura of wisdom without being arrogant or know-it-all. The longer you live, the more you learn how little you know!



Be thoughtful of others and listen to them with attentiveness.
Offer advice only when it is asked for; avoid bossing people around.
Be generous; someone who has lived a long time would know the value of giving back to others in order to lead a fulfilling life.

, Western classics include The Divine Comedy, Paradise Lost, Pride and Prejudice, The Scarlet Letter, Little Women, Wuthering Heights, Leviathan, and Rebecca, but be sure to round out your knowledge with works like Gilgamesh, The Art of War, or I Ching.


Vampire fiction is a very Victorian, romantic choice, but avoid Twilight and all of the recent vampire novels written especially for teenage girls; instead, opt for vivid, horrifying vampire fiction like Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles.
Line the walls of your shelves with old, dog-eared books. Many old books are sold very cheaply or even tossed away at auctions, antique stores, and used book stores. They look amazing when filling a bookshelf and will definitely give the impression you've been around for a time. Funk it up with a mixture of books in between the beautiful of old books, such as interestingly covered books from the 30s, 50s, 60s, 80s, and modern ones to give the impression you've been an avid reader for centuries...

, Fancy penmanship is generally associated with past eras when people were taught to write in elegant scrolls using quills. Learn a penmanship suited to your style and personalize it with little loops here and dashes there. This might require some practice before you settle on a style that works best for you.

, Letter writing, in lieu of text messaging or emailing, is a very immortal-ey pastime. You can put your newly learned penmanship to good use too! To really enhance the immortal effect, you can even seal your envelopes with red wax seals and write with a feather quill, as many people did in past eras.


Be sure to use very formal forms of address. This links back to an era when formality and manners were deeply observed. Read an old etiquette book, such as an early version by Emily Post, to get a good idea of the more formal types of salutations and content.







, An eye for true art is a skill that many young people do not yet have, and so, your maturity of taste will most likely strike others as odd but intensely fascinating.


Borrow books on art and architecture from the library. Study as many images as possible and become familiar with the terms associated with specific eras of art and architecture so that you can use them with ease. This could come in handy when traveling through Europe, as you could point out the architectural styles effortlessly!

, Stay polite but reserved. (Don’t be too unapproachable, though, or else you won’t be able to drop all those hints you’ve been working on.) Act as though you’re not interested in developing any serious attachments. After all, you’re only passing through…

, Until about the 1950s, people had animals in their lives more than we do today. Cats were kept as mousers, horses were still used as draught animals (although they stopped pulling carriages much, much earlier). Rural people would be used to dogs as retrievers, as well as companions, and urban dwellers tended to keep chickens or rabbits for food.

Tend towards being affectionate but unsentimental. A good horse is a good horse, but it's not a person. There's no dichotomy to you in giving a rabbit to a child to play with for an afternoon, then serving them the same rabbit in a stew a few days later. As long as the poor beasts don't suffer unnecessarily, it's all fair.

, You should sit back and let your imagination run wild. You should imagine what you want the story to be like. There are many ways to gather ideas for a story, be it inspiration from your life, the world around you, or the works of other film makers but it is important you think outside the box and try to bring something new to the world. Try your best to come up with an idea that you and others would enjoy, ensuring that is worth all the effort writing the script will entail.

, You have to make a decision and decide what kind of story you want to write. If the plot to the movie is given to you already then build upon that.

, You have to construct the story from scratch. If you want ideas then you should read a few books that have to do with the plot of the movie. This will give you an idea of what to write. Possibly the most important aspect of this step is ensuring that the frame of your story has no big conflicting story points or plot holes in it (unless put there intentionally *a dangerous move probably left to the professionals but if it works out, go right ahead*). This simple self criticism could save you hours if not days of hard work in the future trying to rework the tale so that it all makes sense later on when there are already details built upon the faults.

Allow yourself to be disappointed.,
Get some perspective.,
Channel your disappointment into motivation and action.,
Think of the positives.,
Accept that you were not right for the role.",How to Accept Not Getting Your Desired Role in a Play1," It’s okay to be sad, especially if you put a lot of effort into preparing for your audition. Rejection hurts. Acknowledging and naming what you are feeling helps you work through your emotions.Try naming all the things that are bothering you. For example, you might say, “I am disappointed that I worked so hard only to get rejected. I am jealous that Jackie got a part and I didn’t. I feel left out that a lot of my friends are in big parts in the play, and I won’t get to hang out with them as much.”Talk to a close friend or family member about what you are feeling. Sometimes talking to others helps you feel better and help you better understand your thoughts.
Be gentle with yourself. Take a day or two to be sad. Watch some movies or whatever you like to do to chill out for a bit. Then, regroup and move on to your next challenge.;
, It is disappointing to not get the role you want, but there will be other roles. To be an actor is to routinely deal with disappointment, and know that you are not the first or the last person to feel this way.Talk to others who are feeling or who have felt this way. Maybe other members of the production’s cast and crew were denied the part they wanted. Find some common ground with them--you may even strike up a new friendship.
Read books, articles, and blogs by other actors and learn how they deal with rejection.

, Figure out your next steps. You missed out on this play, but there are other opportunities out there. You could look for other local plays or take acting workshops. Use this setback to become even more determined to succeed!Think about other roles you can audition for. Maybe you didn’t get the lead in the fall musical, but the winter play is coming up soon. Find out what the play will be and start preparing for the role you want.
Look into other theater productions you can audition for. There might be local shows in your community that are holding auditions soon, and maybe there are even some professional opportunities near you.

, Think of all the benefits of not getting the part you wanted. Even if they’re silly, write them all down and make a list. There are two sides to every coin, after all. For example, you might write:Fewer lines means less work trying to remember them.
Limited appearances onstage means fewer after-school rehearsals to go to.
A minor role means less pressure to do a perfect job.

, A director may have a very specific idea of what they are looking for in a role, and for whatever reason, you didn’t fit it. You can give the best audition of your life, but you can’t control the director’s vision.Keep in mind that directors factor a lot of things into their decision about who gets the part. Perhaps the director didn’t think you had good chemistry with the person who would play your romantic interest, or perhaps your appearance wasn’t quite what the director had in mind for the role. These things are all out of your control.
Don’t blame yourself. Rather than tell yourself, “I have no talent. Nobody wants me for their play,” try saying “I did my best, but I wasn’t a good fit. There will be other opportunities.”"

Be the best you can be in your role.,
Have a positive attitude.,
Pay attention.,
Offer to be an understudy.,
Have fun!",How to Accept Not Getting Your Desired Role in a Play2," If you got a smaller role in the play, take it just as seriously as you would your preferred major role. Show the director that you have a good work ethic, and they may keep you in mind for future shows.



Make your character shine, even if you are in the chorus.
Show up to all your rehearsals.
Learn your lines and know your blocking.

, Come to rehearsal with a smile on your face, ready to work. Don’t complain if you have to rehearse the same scene twelve times in a row to get it right, and ignore other people’s complaints. Acknowledge how lucky you are to have a part in the production, no matter how small it may be.


If you are feeling frustrated by the rehearsal process, you could tell yourself, “I want to be here. I’m here to learn. I’m lucky to have this part.”
Don’t talk about other performers behind their backs. It is unprofessional. Don’t say things like, “I know I could have done that scene a thousand times better than he did.”
Congratulate the person who got the part you wanted. It shows grace and maturity. You could say, “I think you are going to do a fabulous job as Dolly. You have such an amazing voice!”

, Since you will have more downtime with a smaller part, observe the production coming together and witness the rehearsals. Watch the director blocking the actors or offering insight on how to deliver lines. Use what you learn and apply it to your current and future roles.


For example, the director may consistently ask the actors to use more gestures when saying their lines. Tuck this piece of advice away for the future. If you get a chance to audition for the director again, be sure to utilize more gestures in your audition!
Learn from the other actors. Watch what they do and apply their strengths to your own performance technique.

, If understudies for roles in your production have not been assigned, approach your director and offer to step in if necessary. You never know when you will get an opportunity to step up in a production, so pay attention to other people’s parts and responsibilities. Sometimes people need to back out of productions due to unforeseen circumstances.


You could say, “Mr. Williams, I know you haven’t assigned an understudy for Melanie’s part yet. I’d love to be considered for the opportunity. I’ve been watching the blocking and have a pretty good handle on the lines.”

, Even if you didn’t get your dream role, being in a play can be great fun. You may make new friendships or forge stronger ones as you work together toward a common goal. Enjoy the experience, and celebrate your cast’s accomplishment when it comes time to perform your play.


Enjoy your downtime during rehearsals by getting to know your castmates.
Invite your friends and family to come see you. Have your parents take pictures and take a video of your play.
Have fun at the cast party and celebrate a job well done!

Try a burlesque style.,
Put on your fangs.,
Wear a cape if you want to look like Dracula.",How to Act Like a Vampire1," Vampires like dark colored clothing, such as Count Dracula’s black silk cape.

Pull back your hair so that it doesn’t get in the way.Wipe the foundation over your entire face, as well as your ears and neck.You could also apply some gold eyeshadow underneath your eyes., Use a white eye liner pencil to erase outside edges of your eyebrows. You’ll want to cover over the last inch of your eyebrows, where they curve down around your eye sockets. Then, use a micro detailing paint brush to draw your vampire eyebrows. Apply some black paint to the paint brush. Paint the outside of your eyebrows so that they go up to a point., You can use either a black makeup pencil or a brush with black foundation. Draw a widow’s peak above your eyes, so it looks like your eyebrows are very dark and pointy., Use a small brush to apply some red eyeliner to your eyelids. Concentrate on the edges of the eyelids, so that you have a hint of red in your eyes. Then, paint your eyelashes with black mascara.Wear enough eye makeup to look sultry and mysterious, but not so much that you look like you just lost a fight.
Whereas some vamps like to use black eyeshadow, others prefer neutrals.You could put some shiny green eyeshadow on the corners of your eyes.

, Crimson or red lips are important for a vampire, since they make it look like you just fed on some fresh blood. Choose your favorite red lipstick, preferably a darker shade, and apply it to your lips.Girls can use red or purple lipstick to achieve the right effect, while guys can use a little lip stain or fake blood to get the same look.

, Apply black makeup to a fine detailing brush. Paint lines coming down from your eyes in a cobweb formation. Add some red paint to the brush and apply little red tears at the bottom of the lines., To imply that you recently drank blood, paint some blood falling from your mouth. You can use your fine brush and some red makeup.Alternately, you can apply fake blood.

Figure out which vampire you want to play.,
Play “unfair” as a vampire character and fair as a player.,
Highlight the narcissism of your vampire character.,
Know your character.",How to Act Like a Vampire3," If you are participating in a live action role playing game (LARP), you may have already been assigned a particular vampire to play. However, if the event is more open-ended, you may get to choose a particular character. If you are not sure which vampire you could find some inspiration by reading some vampire books or watching a vampire movie:


Read John William Polidori's The Vampyre.

Read Bram Stoker's Dracula.

Read Stephenie Meyer's Twilight.

Check out Anne Rice's The Vampire Chronicles.

Watch a vampire themed television show, such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel or The Vampire Diaries.

Watch a vampire movie, such as Nosferatu, Interview with a Vampire, The Lost Boys, Blade, Vampires, or From Dusk Til Dawn.”


, During the LARP, you should always have a reason for making a move against another character in the game. You should always play fair and avoid cheating. That said, you should have fun playing the role of vampire, which may include cruel or “unfair” things, like blood sucking or killing another character., Vampires are typically depicted as narcissistic or self-serving.To highlight this trait, try walking with an air of authority, with your shoulders back and your head held high.You should only be interested in talking about yourself.
You should only become animated during your own speeches. If anyone else dares to open their mouth, you should adopt an expression of boredom and disdain.Whenever someone you don't approve of is speaking, you should adopt an expression of distaste and look down your nose at the speaker.

, By knowing your character, you can respond quickly to other players in the LARP. You can improvise and have fun!For instance, your character probably has an ability to heal rapidly. Vampires can be brought to the very brink of destruction, only to be resuscitated and restored to their former glory by a few drops of blood.
Try speaking in a low voice. As depicted in vampire movies, a low speaking voice is typical of vampires.

Work on your soul-piercing gaze.,
Act out your aversion to sunlight.,
Maintain a serious disposition.",How to Act Like a Vampire4," If you are taking inspiration from a film like Dracula, you should work on your soul-piercing gaze. Try to look right through people. To achieve this effect, you should practice an unblinking gaze which you can hold for what is seemingly longer than humanly possible.Don't be surprised if people consider you to be ""off with the fairies"" rather than perceptive; it's a hard look to pull off, as sometimes you can look dazed rather than intent.

, If someone opens the curtains or you're forced to walk outside during the day, you should hiss and draw your cloak protectively over your face. You should also claim to be highly photo-sensitive and prone to sunburn.


Vampires can never feel fully at ease during the day. Once night falls, however, you can relax and be your normal fearless self again. You are master (or mistress) of the night.

, Vampires are not known for their bubbly, fun personalities. They are serious and contemplative, without time or patience for frivolity. As seen in the movies, a vampire should be withdrawn, sullen, demure and silent.Vampires don't giggle either. If you must laugh, aim for a dark chuckle or grunt of amusement.

Come up with an idea.,
Invent your characters.,
Sketch out the major plot points of your movie.,
Write your script.,
Do a table read to improve your writing.","How to Write, Direct and Edit Your Own Movie1"," Unless you have an imagination the size of Oceania, this will be the hardest part. Coming up with the idea for your movie, however, does not need to be an intense showdown with the Artistic Muse. Try and get one good sentence, like the one you read in a movie description, to base your movie around. What is the conflict, character, or story you want to tell? Keep in mind a few things when planning:


Smaller is better -- if you are shooting this yourself, every extra character, location, and special effect will need to be financed and figured out at some point.
What genre are you aiming for? Comedy? Sci-fi? Drama? Once you know your genre you can start thinking of plots and characters that fit it.
What are movie combinations that you haven't seen? While it seems childish, almost all movies and TV are hybrids of other movies, TV, and genres. For example, Twilight is Vampire + Romance Novel. Have you seen a good comedic western? What about a stoner sci-fi? How can you match your interests in unexpected ways?
Where do you have experience? Can you comment on the day-to-day life of an office worker in an original way? Do you know more about disc golf than anyone else? Is there a movie in these experiences somewhere?Look up ""log-lines"" for your favorite movies for inspiration. These are similar one sentence synopsis of movies used to sell the script to movie executives. You can search 1000's of them online.;
, Characters drive stories. Almost all movies are the result of a character who wants something but is unable to get it. The movie then shows the trials and tribulations of the character(s) as they try and fulfill their desires (get the girl, save the world, graduate college, etc.) The audience relates to the character, not your film, so you need to make sure you have well thought out characters before beginning. Good characters:



Are round.This means that they have multiple facets, not just an ""angry man,"" or ""strong heroine."" Round characters have strengths and weaknesses, which make them relatable to the audience.

Have desires and fears. Even if there is only one of each, a good character wants something but is unable to get it. Their ability or inability to get over their fear (of being poor, of being alone, of space aliens, of spiders, etc.) is what drives their conflict.

Have agency. A good character is not whipped around because your script needs them to go somewhere. A good character makes choices which push forward the plot. Sometimes this is only one choice that drives everything else (Llewellyn, No Country for Old Men), sometimes it is a series of good/bad choices in every scene (American Hustle)., Some people like to come up with characters and a premise and then start writing. All screenwriters, however, see the value of the 5-point plot, where 5 key, escalating moments make up the movie. Almost every single movie made follows this general structure, from Jurassic Park, and Just Friends, to Jupiter Ascending.'This does not mean your script must follow this template, but there is a method to the madness. There are 5 major moments in every film that fall in the exact same place, and you need a good reason to deviate from this system if you want to be ""original:""The Set-Up: Who are your characters, where do they live, and what do they want? This is the first 10% or less of your movie.

The Change of Plans/Opportunity/Conflict: Something happens that sets your conflict in motion -- Erin Brockovich gets a job, the school of Superbad throws a party, Neo is introduced to The Matrix, etc. This is roughly the 1/3 mark of your script.

The Point of No Return: Up until this point, the characters are working hard to make their goals a reality. But, at the halfway point of the movie, something happens to make it impossible to turn back. A Bond villain attacks again, the Gladiator arrives in Rome, Thelma and Louise rob their first store, etc.

The Major Set-Back: Since the point of no return the stakes have gotten higher. To the characters and audience, all hope seems lost. This is when the girl and guy break-up in every romantic comedy ever made, when Ron Burgundy gets fired in Anchorman, and when John McClane is beaten and bloody in Die Hard. This comes at the 75% mark of your story.

The Climax: The characters make one last, all-out push to reach their goals, culminating in their biggest challenge of all. This is the run through the airport moment, the final holes in Caddyshack, or the showdown between hero and villain. Once resolved, the last 10% of the script ties up loose ends and shows the aftermath of the climax., If you are producing the movie yourself you can use any writing format you like. However, screenwriting software like Celtx, Writer Duets, and Final Draft will help you get studio-quality formatting along with tools specific for screenwriters. These programs will auto-format for you, and are a great way to know the length of your movie-- 1 page of formatted script equals roughly 1 minute of screen time.


Give yourself some notes on things like setting, scenery, and actors, but focus mainly on the dialogue. You'll be making the other decisions later, when you have cameras, actors, and locations.
Prepare yourself for rewrites as well. It is nearly impossible to get all of your moments -- characters, plots, themes, jokes, etc. -- right in the first run through. Once you're done, return to the script and try and read it objectively. Would you watch this movie?

, Table reads are essential for honing a good script and preparing to film. Get together a couple of friends or actors and give them each a script 2-3 days in advance. Then invite them over and do a dry run of the entire movie, having them speak out the parts while you or someone else narrates the actions. Make notes of any lines that sound unnatural or awkward, where a scene falls short, and how long the script takes to read.Ask the actors/friends what they thought. Where did they get confused, what did they love? Ask them if they felt like their character was well thought out and consistent.
Try not to play a part and just listen. Do you hear your movie coming to life? Does it sound like you hoped it would? You want to hear these moments now, not when the cameras turn on."
"
Make a list of all of your equipment and equipment needs.,
Make a storyboard for each scene.,
Find your sets and locations.,
Use your storyboard and equipment list to make your budget.,
Hire actors and crew members.,
Sign contracts.,
Make your filming schedule.","How to Write, Direct and Edit Your Own Movie2"," Making a movie takes a lot of gear, including cameras, microphones, and lights. Take a quick inventory of what you have for equipment, then find ways to fill in the holes:



Cameras: Of course, you could never film a movie without a camera. For most movies, you need at least 2 cameras, and preferably 3. That said, modern camera advancements have made it possible to film a movie with an iPhone 6, so you don't have to drop big bucks anymore. The most important thing for a professional film is to have cameras that shoot in the same format (1080i, for example), otherwise the video quality will change subtly with every cut.

Microphones: If you're in a bind, spend your money on audio equipment: audiences are proven to notice bad sound before bad video. While you can use the attached camera microphones if you must, a Tascam or shotgun mic is always a worthwhile investment.Lighting: If you can get a get great 3-5 piece lighting kit, use it. These lights have a variety of functions and settings that help you light any situation imaginable. However, 5-10 cheap clamp lights and extension cords have lit many an indie film. All you need are lights and different light bulbs (tungsten, frosted, LED, etc.) to customize your scene.Essential Accessories: Depending on the movie, you'll need memory cards, a backup hard drive, tripods, light reflectors, extension cords, black tape (to cover or tape down wires), and computer video editing software., Storyboards look a bit like rough comic books -- you draw the general shot, then add the dialog that needs to be said underneath. You can download templates online easily, then draw them in before a shoot. Storyboards are like checklists while you're filming, helping you capture each shot you need so that, when you're editing, you don't realize suddenly you're missing something.Each frame you draw becomes your shot list -- a detailed book filled with every camera angle you need to capture to tell your story. Once your storyboard is finished, copy it and put it into a binder for later reference.
Make notes of cuts and transitions, and essential sound-effects. These drawings don't have to be art, they have to tell the story of your film visually.These may feel tedious, but they will save you time on set, which quickly gets expensive.

, There are many schools of thought about choosing sets, and none of them are wrong. You can build your own sets for ultimate creative control, but this takes time and a lot of money. You can shoot in houses and locations you have easy access too, like your friend's house or backyard. Alternatively, you can rent out spaces that you love, getting the rights to film at a school, hotel, or park. No matter what you do, make sure your set fits your movie, and will allow you and your crew to take over the place for multiple hours, undisturbed.

, This may be the moment every filmmaker hates the most, but you need a realistic idea of your film's cost before you start shooting. You do not, for example, want to get halfway through shooting and realize you can't afford to rent a car for the climactic chase scene anymore. Keep your budget simple and realistic. Do you really need 10 prop guns, or can you do with 2? Can you eliminate or change a scene with 100 extras to have 10? You need to budget for:


Equipment that you don't currently own.
Props, costumes, and locations (such as renting out a ballroom or restaurant).
Crew and actor fees. It is possible to get crews and actors for free, but it rare to get people to help for more than 1-2 days without pay.
Food and transportation costs for you, the crew, and the actors.
Know that, for a ""professional"" shoot, with paid crew and actors, you should budget, at minimum, $5,000 a day.

, You have your characters, your shot list, and the necessary equipment -- now you need someone to use it all. How to cast actors is a personal choice -- you can hold auditions using Craigslist or newspaper posts, visit local theaters, or get your friends involved. As for crew members, there is a variety of posts that you need to fill:



Director of Photography (DP): Arguably the most important job, they are in charge of cameras and lights. While you direct the actors and give the final say on the shot, they handle the technical aspects of the film. You need someone who understands lenses, cameras, and lighting, even if it is just a friend who is into photography. It is very, very hard to effectively light a scene, place, cameras, watch actors, and set the scenery at the same time, so get someone who can take some of the load off you and allow you to direct.

Assistant Director (AD): Schedules the shots, makes sure the shot list is covered, films small scenes if the director is occupied. May help budget as well.

Camera and microphone operators: Self-explanatory, but essential. You can't make a film without them.

Make-up Artist: While anyone can do this, their main job is continuity. Unless a lot of time goes by in your film, you need the actor's face and costumes to look identical in every single scene, otherwise the audience will notice the changes. Take pictures every day of the costume, make-up and scenes to make sure it looks the same.

Sound Engineer: Listen to all the sound as it is being recorded, ensuring that it is right. They also place the microphones to pick up dialog after the lights have been placed.

Line Producer: Checks out locations ahead of time, makes sure permits and contracts are written and signed.

Production Assistant: Always useful, these people do whatever needs to be done-- preparing food and coffee, wiping memory cards, and even holding a camera when needed. You can never have enough crew members.

, It doesn't matter who you are working with or what the project is -- get a contract signed. This protects you in the case of accidents, legally obligates people to see your movie through to completion, and prevents lawsuits in case the movie gets picked up. You can search online for ""Actor Film Contract,"" ""Producer Contract,"" etc. and tailor it to your needs easily and freely, so don't skimp out on this step.Contracts are, paradoxically, a great way to preserve friendships. Instead of arguing over something later, you can simply return to what you already have in writing.
Make sure to have a provision, especially for actors, that requires them to finish the film once they begin shooting.

, Realistically, unless you only have a few people in your script and 1-2 locations you're only going to get 5-10 pages of your script done in a good day. For big or difficult scenes, you may only get 2-3 pages. The more time you can spend filming the better, but the more time spent filming the more money you will spend as well. How you balance this depends on a few factors:


What scenes all take place at the same location? Can you film them, even if they are out of order, on the same day?
What scenes have massive shot lists? Getting these done first can ensure you get the ""big"" scenes the way you want them.
Are any shots expendable if time/money is running short? Put these last.
This schedule may, and likely will, have to be fluid. But the more you can stick to it, the better.

"
"
Prepare for everything in advance.,
Let everyone know what is expected at the beginning of the shoot.,
Set up the scene blocking.,
Set your cameras up.,
Set-up your lights.,
Know how to start a shoot.,
Shoot your coverage once you have the scene you want.,
Review your footage every day and cross off your shot-list.,
Pick up B-roll shots.,
Back up your footage every day.","How to Write, Direct and Edit Your Own Movie3"," You should be the first one on set and the last one to leave every single day. Filming a movie is not easy, and you need to assume that anything that can go wrong will. Actors get sick, weather doesn't cooperate, and there are 100's of little decisions (lighting, character placement, costumes) that need to be made every hour. The only way to have a successful shoot is to do as much work as you can before you even start.


Review the day's shot list. What do you need to get, and what can you cut if you run out of time?
Rehearse with the actors. Make sure they know their lines and how you want them played.
Review lighting and camera choices with the DP., Give everyone the details in a straightforward manner right from the top. This is especially important for low-budget films, as you will usually be getting some acting and work for free. Let the cast and crew know your goals for the day's shoot and how thankful they are for your support.


Give out the day's schedule in advance so everyone is prepared.
Let the crew know about any special effects or moods you are going for and how they can help create them.
Review your shooting procedure so that everyone knows their role.

, Blocking is where the actors are, and where they go. This is the first step to any filming, and the most essential -- all the lights, cameras, and sound cannot be placed until after it is done. If the scene is well rehearsed this should be easy. If not, you'll need to spend some time placing the actors in the right spots.


Keep this as simple as possible-- walking in straight lines, basic entrances and exits, and mostly still positions. It is not a play and the cameras will only capture a small fraction of the entire scene. Let the camera do the movement whenever possible, not the actors.Tape can be placed on the floor to tell the actors where to end up after every shot.
You can often pre-plan using crew-members or a detailed shot list to save time. If you have the blocking already written out, your shoot will be much more productive.

, There are an infinite number of ways to place, move, and use your cameras. This is why a shot-list, which is basically a list of your prearranged camera positions, is vital to save time and money. In the interest of time, the three essential camera angles in a scene of dialog are:



Establishing shots, or masters: Establishing shots contain all the action of the scene -- the speaking characters, the set, and the movements. They are long, wide shots that, if anything went wrong, you could use to film the entire scene, as they capture everything.

2-shot (2-cameras): One camera over each actors shoulder, pointing at the other actor. This way you get to look at each character as they talk.
When filming 3 or more actors, try and block it out so that you have 2 characters in the frame at once -- this way you only need one camera to capture their dialog.
Watch some of your favorite movies with a discerning eye. How, for example, would a movie capture a dinner date between 2 people? You'll notice these three camera angles (one of both of them + the table, one of the guy, one of the girl) more than any other set of shots.

, Remember, it is always better to have more light than to have less. It is easy to darken an image in post-production, but it is very hard to make it lighter without sacrificing image quality. Use natural light to your advantage whenever possible and, above all, keep it simple. Your goal is a nice, gradual range of lights -- deep, dark shadows and very few big bright spots.


Put your camera in black and white to see just the lightness of the image. If it is still an interesting shot in black and white, it will look incredible in color.
The hour and a half around sunrise and sunset is considered the best time to shoot in natural light. The lighting is soft and even, and you can even use this time to illuminate ""nighttime"" shots, which are dimmed later on in post-production.Use ""practicals,"" or in-scene lights. Having trouble getting the light right? Stick a lamp in the shot, or turn on the ceiling lights., The techniques for beginning a film will vary from set to set, but they should not vary from shot to shot. Having a routine before you start filming ensures that everyone is on the same page, every time. When possible, this is the AD's duty. A sample routine would include:


""Everyone this is picture, quiet please!""
""Roll sound!"" This is the cue to start microphones. When done, someone yells, ""Rolling!""
""Roll Picture!"" This is the cue to start cameras. When done, someone yells, typically, ""Speed!""
Read off the title, scene, and take number, ""This is My Movie, Scene 1, Take 2."" If you have a clapboard, it is slapped and someone shouts ""Marker!""
3-5 seconds of silence.
""ACTION!"", Pick a few extreme angles, interesting shots of the environment, or close-ups of character's faces, hands, or props and run the scene again. These shots may only last for 1-2 seconds in the movie, but they are essential for editing. Look at any movie and notice how many small, seemingly useless shots are used to get into the world of the scene, show an emotional twitch, or simply transition from scene to scene. Film these shots once the actors have delivered their lines to your liking.Do the characters talk about the cake on the table? Then you need a shot of just the cake on the table. Do you need to show what time it is? Then you need a shot of the clock on the wall., You may need to make some sacrifices depending on your budget and time, but even Hollywood directors are forced to do this. After every day, make sure you have everything you want and need, then cross it off your shot list. You need to know now, not 3 months later as you start editing, if something is missing.

, B-roll is simply the shots that don't include actors. It is usually used in transitions, opening or closing credits, or setting up a new location. Head out with a camera and you DP and get as many hours of footage as you can. You primary goal is to think about footage that may compliment the film. For example, the B-Roll in Punch-Drunk Love is a series of abstract, multi-colored shots that match the protagonist's confused, anxious, and crippled mental state. Spy movies usually have a lot of B-Roll of gorgeous beaches, bustling cities, and dramatic landscapes. B-roll tells your story subtly and visually.


You can never have enough B-roll. When you're editing, this is the connective tissue that holds your scenes together to make a legitimate movie.
You can, and should, shoot B-roll before and after a scene ""ends,"" as these 2-3 seconds are a great way to bring the audience into the scene slowly., At the end of shooting take the time to pull your footage off memory cards and download it to a secure hard drive. This small step at the end of the day can save you hours and hours of time in the unfortunate case that you lose your footage.


Most professionals use more than one backup, copying all the footage to at least two sources before erasing anything on the memory cards.
Take this time to organize your footage as well. Make a folder for the day you shot, then organize the footage in that folder by scene. This will make shooting much, much easier.

Find the core idea -- a villain, setting, or gimmick-- that will make your film unique.,
Tap into your own fears for inspiration.,
Watch horror movies and read horror movie scripts.,
Understand script-writing format.,
Sketch out your five main plot points.",How to Write a Horror Movie1," Horror films are largely formulaic when it comes to structure, but the best horror movies have an element that sets it apart from the rest. This core idea will be the foundation of your entire script, but it is also the hardest thing to come up with. However, you do not need to reinvent the entire genre -- one little thing to make your movie enough is often more than enough:



Paranormal Activity is a classic haunted house movie, but it is fully shot by webcams and security footage, giving it a unique look and feel.

You're Next turns a basic serial killer movie on its head by making one of the ""victims"" a better killer than the supposed villains.

Scream would be a basic slasher film, but the characters' unique knowledge of horror film ""rules"" was so inventive it spawned four sequels and endless imitators.
Even changing the setting alone can be enough to make a movie unique. 30 Days of Night is a basic vampire movie, but it's set in the North Pole, where night lasts a whole month.;
, There are many possible reasons why we love being scared, but one of them is the communal connection people have over their deepest fears. The fear of the dark, fear of death, and fear of losing our loved ones are deep, universal fears that will naturally work into your script. However, the king of all of these fears, and of all fear, is the fear of the unknown. What times in your own life have you been confused and terrified? The things that scare you will scare other people, so feel free to tap into your own life and fears for inspiration.What horror movies scare you? What scenes do you still remember?
When have you been scared lately? What is it that really scared you, and how can you replicate that fear in others?, Just like any other artist, you need to study from the best to learn from the best. Take time to watch horror movies regularly, then read the screenplays (found online with a quick search) of your favorite movies. While you're studying, take notes on the following:


How does the writer create tension on the page without music or actors?
Is the screenplay itself scary?
How do you format scares and different, tense scenes?
At what page or minute does each scare occur?
What parts fail, and how would you fix them? What parts succeed, and why?, Luckily, there are hundreds of resources and programs that will automatically format your script into the right format for you. Still, you need to know how to create a professional looking script if you ever want your movie to be made. The format is not arbitrary -- it is made to make shooting and planning the movie easy for everyone, and you'll find it comes naturally after some practice.


Celtx and Writer Duets are free programs with auto-formatting for scripts. If you want to write professionally, you should consider buying Final Draft Pro, the industry standard scriptwriter., Every horror movie ever made follows a simple but highly customizable format. Unless you have a really good reason to break it, the following format will help you quickly draft up your movie for the best pacing. Use this structure to build the skeleton of your movie, then make it unique in the individual scenes:Beginning: Open on a scary event. This is usually the villain's first victim-- the murder or event that sets the movie in motion and shows the villain's ""style"". In Scream, for example, it is Drew Barrymore's babysitter character and boyfriend getting murdered.The Set-Up: Who are your main characters, and why are they in this ""horrible"" place? The teens might head to the Cabin in the Woods, or the family moves into the creepy old house in Amityville. Either way, we get to know the future ""victims"" of your script. The villain or evil may be present, but is lurking in the background. This is the first 10-15% of your movie.

The Warning: Roughly a third of the way into the script, a few characters realize that not everything is as it seems. Many of them will ignore or miss the signs, but the viewer knows that the evil is growing around them.

The Point of No Return: The characters realize they are stuck in this horror. The first character dies, the villain appears, or they get literally trapped, like in The Descent. There is no more ignoring the danger. This is usually halfway through the story.

The Major Set-Back: At 75% or so, the characters believe they have won. Suddenly, however, the villain comes back even stronger than before. This false sense of security lulls the characters into near-certain doom.

The Climax: Your main character(s) makes a final push to survive by escaping or defeating the villain. The adrenaline is high, and you need a climactic fight/scare/moment to cap everything off.The Resolution: All is well, and the main character has survived. The villain appears dead, and everything is good again... at least until the sequel or very ending, when evil often resurfaces (Drag Me to Hell, V/H/S).

What you choose to use is largely a matter of personal preference and the type of project you are working on:



Free software, like iMovie and Windows Movie Maker, is really only useful for small movies, usually anything under 20 minutes. They aren't designed to handle a lot of video and camera angles and have a limited number of transitions and options for effects.

Paid Software is necessary for any aspiring filmmaker. If you use multiple cameras on a scene, need smooth text, transitions, or effects, or simply want a professional-grade program, you need to invest in good software. Currently, the three ""industry-standard"" programs are Avid, Final Cut X, and Adobe Premier, and each comes with a hefty price tag, often $400 or more. You can often, however, subscribe to these programs for a small monthly payment.

, With a short film (under 20-30 minutes), you can likely import all the footage at once. But if you're making a feature film, or simply working with a lot of camera angles, you'll want to edit your movie in pieces. Import only the footage you need for the scene, as well as any relevant B-roll.


If you have multiple cameras on the same scene, use your program's ""Sync"" option to line all of them up together. Find your programs ""multi-camera editing mode,"" which makes it easy to switch between multiple shots simultaneously, by searching for ""Multi-Cam Edit"" online. This matches up all the cameras so that you don't have to spend hours making sure each cut is in time with the last shot., The first shots will establish the focus of the scene. You have an almost infinite number of choices, but some of the most common include:



The Establishing Shot: This is by far the most common way to start a scene. This shot shows all the main actors, the scene, and the location at one time. This allows the audience to get a feel for the scene, and they can then follow along with the rest of the cuts to come.

Character Focused: Whether they say the first line or not, following the main character of the scene the tells the audience that this is the person they need to pay attention to -- something will happen to them or they will have some realization.

Setting the Scene: Use B-roll and shots of the room/environment to get a feel for the location. This is used in a lot of movies, particularly horror, where a scene might start with 5-6 creepy shots of a haunted house of dangerous room.

, Rewatch your footage and see which scenes you like the best -- where everyone hit their marks, the dialog felt natural, and the footage is clear and in focus. If you can find one take where everything is well done, you're in luck, and your work will be much faster.

, This rule is not hard and fast, but you should almost always begin with it. From there you can decide if it is more important to watch a character listening or a character talking. Watch Whiplash or There Will Be Blood for a good idea of where scene focus should be in dialog oriented films.


The best character to show in a scene is usually a matter of feel. Who does it feel like needs to be the focus of the line? Does an actor give a particularly good expression or reaction to something? Where would your eyes go if you were sitting in the room with the actors?

, Sometimes you don't get one good take, and you need to combine a lot of footage to make the scene work. This is incredibly common, but it should not be difficult if the actors hit their blocking correctly each time. This is when you add the detail and color to the scene. For example, a character might offer someone the cake on the table, and you can cut to a shot of the cake. Or, in a tense interrogation scene, you might show the criminals face up close, sweating and worried, before cutting back to the next line of dialog.There is no right way to edit a scene, as long as you remember that you are trying to tell the story above all else. Let the images do the talking as much as possible.

, Editing is about pacing and timing. You need the film to flow naturally. This is why editors think in terms of individual frames -- the micro-second still shots you see if you pause the screen -- instead of seconds. Many editors work to music for this reason, editing the frames to fit a beat or song and give the scene rhythm.You do not have to stick to the natural rhythm of the actors on screen, and in many cases you shouldn't. Adding or deleting pauses, even by a few tenths of second, can make a good performance a great one. For example:


Comedic, action oriented, or high-energy scenes have very quick timing. There are not a lot of spaces between the lines, and the words almost fall over each other to come out. This makes the scene feel quick and lively.
Tense scenes are usually slower. Pauses are drawn out, B-roll is used heavily, and shots are held for a long time to make the viewer uncomfortable. For a master-class in slow editing, watch 12 Years a Slave, particularly the hanging scene in the middle of the movie.
It takes a human brain 3-5 frames to recognize an image. This means that, if you're trying to be too quick with things, you may just confuse the audience., Editing is the art of telling a story through cuts. In other words, a movie is simply a series of videos put back to back, and how you cut from one to the other is how the audience perceives the story. Therefore, how you order cut from one video to the other is all the ""matters"" when editing a film. The best cuts are seamless, telling the story without the audience every realizing that we've jumped from one scene to the other.Hard Cut-- an immediate cut to another angle, usually in the same scene. This is the most common cut in film.

Smash Cut- An abrupt shift to completely different scene. This calls attention to the cut, often signalling a surprise or big shift in the plot.

Jump Cut-- An abrupt cut made within the same scene, often of a slightly different angle. These are rare, and usually show confusion or the passing of time.

J-Cut-- When you hear the audio from the next shot before you see the video. This is a great way to link two scenes thematically, or provide narration.

L-Cut-- When you see the video from the next shot before you hear the audio. This is a great way to show a character talking about something, like a promise, then doing it (or breaking it).

Action Cut-- A cut in the middle of an action, like someone opening a door, that ""hides"" the cut in the action. For example, one character could move in for a kiss, and as their head crosses the screen you cut to the head entering the screen of another angle, usually the person about to be kissed., Once you've made your scenes, it's time to start pulling them together. If you've editing all your scenes as separate files, import them into a new ""Master Film"" project and put them in order. Then, use your B-roll, coverage shots, and transitions to make them flow seamlessly together. Whereas you originally looked at the scene timing, now you're looking at movie timing -- can you trim a scene back here and there to make things move faster? Do you need a little more B-roll between scenes to give the audience time to react to a dramatic moment? Again -- timing is everything.


This is a good time to ask a friend to watch the movie with you. Do they get everything that's going on? Are there any plot points that are lost in the shuffle and need more time? Any that are over-explained and can cut away?
In general, the more you cut, the better the movie. If a scene isn't working, and it doesn't add anything useful to the plot, get rid of it.

, Once you have the movie as good as it can be it's time for the long process of clean-up. The last, and most important, steps for a professional movie are color correction and sound mixing. While there are entire books written on the subject, the best advice is to just make it all look consistent -- the scenes have similar lighting and color, and there are no spots where the sound is glaringly loud or difficult to hear.


There are many studios that, for a small fee, can be paid to do professional color correction and sound mixing. If you are unsure how to do this and want a professional movie, you should absolutely pay for professional color grading and sound mixing., There are a lot of flashy, famous, and stylized movies out there that seem like a great idea to copy. Quentin Tarantino and Guy Ritchie, in particular, have seen their animated, kinetic styles in movies like Pulp Fiction and Lock, Stock, & Two Smoking Barrels, appropriated by young filmmakers everywhere. What these people don't realize is that those directors chose that style because it fit the movie. The editing looks effortless because it simply let the stories (kinetic, action-oriented stories) take center-stage. Your number one job when editing is to let the story tell itself naturally. You guide the viewer, but at no point should the viewer comment on the editing. The best editing is invisible."
"
Kick the script off with a scare or significant moment of tension.,
Build sympathy for at least one character for the first 10-20 pages.,
Ratchet up the tension slowly.,
Unleash the horror halfway through the movie.,
Let your protagonists start to pull ahead, then chop them back down to size with roughly 25% left to go.,
Close everything up with a climactic showdown or scare.,
Provide the audience some semblance of resolution.",How to Write a Horror Movie2," This is the classic way to open up a horror film, as it preps the audience for what is to come and unsettles them early on. The best horror movies scare viewers even when nothing bad is happening because the opening scene makes them aware of the evil lurking around the corner. Use this first scene to prime the audience for future scares. It shouldn't be the most terrifying moment in the movie -- just enough to make them curious or worried.The Exorcist's opening isn't the scariest thing in the world, but the odd, primordial location hints at the ancient, malevolent demon that lurks underneath the surface throughout the movie.

Scream boasts one of the most famous, and chilling, openings in horror history. It is basically a short film showcasing the killer's first villain. Writer Kevin Williamson gives us everything -- tone, gore, humor, and terror -- while showing us that no one is safe.There are exceptions to this rule. Cabin in the Woods starts mundanely in an effort to lure the viewer into a false sense of security, for example.

, For maximum frights, you need the audience to care about the characters and their fate. If they don't then the eventual deaths will ring hollow and you won't get great scares as a result. All of the best horror movies have the best characters, not just a good villain. Take some time to let your characters converse and hang out before the evil really takes hold -- it will pay off later.



The Poltergeist takes its time making you feel for the ""average American family"" at the core of it, making their later terrors feel like they could happen in anyone's home, anywhere.

Nightmare on Elm Street spends a good 15-20 minutes at the kid's school, then another few minutes at a standard slumber party, building up sympathy for the main characters.

You're Next goes the opposite direction, setting up the dysfunctional, annoying, manipulative family at the heart of the movie so that you root for the killers (who are being hunted) by the ending.

, The best scares come later in the movie, when your audience is primed and already on the edge of their seat. This is your biggest challenge while writing -- building tension carefully without boring the audience or numbing them to the scares. The easiest way to do this is to defy expectations. Remember -- viewers are often more scared by what they don't see than what they do. Use the fear of the unknown to your advantage. Once you've set up characters and setting, start to break the norm -- moving furniture, missing characters, odd signs/signals, ominous news bulletins, etc. Again, watching the experts will help you:



The Conjuring doesn't kill a single person, yet is considered by many a modern classic. The tension comes from what is not on screen. When you see the shaking cabinets, shadowy feet, and hear strange noises, the viewer's imagination does all the work for them.

Halloween succeeds largely because we don't know where Michael Myers is at any time. He could be behind any corner, in any room, because the writer wisely leaves him in the background in order to build tension. Because he so rarely ""jumps out,"" we never know when to expect him.Many horror films rely on ""jump scares,"" when a loud noise or quick jump startles the viewer immediately. However, modern movies are using ""fake"" scares to build tension, having good guys (or pets) pop out to lull the viewer into a sense of security.

, Your first big kill is going to kick the last two-thirds of the movie into high gear. This almost always needs to be a major character, and the death indicates to the characters, and the viewer, that there is no turning back now. Everyone is in grave danger, and all of the audience's worst fears have come to fruition. This scene needs to be scary, a big payoff from the prior minutes of tension building, so work on making this scene stand out.


It is often best to imagine this moment as a mini-movie with a beginning, middle, and ending. Think of one specific scare and then work backward to make the scene shine., Give your characters a glimmer of hope after the first major death. While things are terrible for a while (another character or two often dies between this moment and the first death), eventually the main character(s) get a grip on the situation. They decide to escape, or fight back, and they start to succeed too... until the villain cuts their plans short at the last minute.



The Night of the Living Dead has a tense, action-filled attempt at escape, a chance to get everyone out of the farmhouse. The characters even make it to the car, and avoid all the zombies, until their rushed, faulty plan literally blows up in their face.

Shaun of the Dead, a horror-comedy that sticks to horror structure, finds the main characters successfully boarded up until one of their greedy friends lies about being bitten.

, At least one character needs to escape from the failed plan, and they must make one final, last-ditch effort to survive. Depending on your movie, you can take this in multiple directions, but, in general, the characters either decide to run away or fight back the evil.



Funny Games' main character decides, despite her hatred for the villains, that all she can do is run. What follows is a tense, cat & mouse scene of hopeful escape.

Dawn of the Dead finds the desperate survivors willing to fight for their freedom, taking the battle straight to the zombies instead of waiting.

, By the end of the move, you need to reveal the killer (if it is another character), and you need to show whether or not the main character has triumphed. Commonly, the main character triumphs over the evil, only to be taken by surprise at the very end of the movie, like in Drag Me to Hell and Nightmare on Elm Street. Sometimes the main characters are killed, but there is a hint that the villain is not actually dead. No matter what your ending is, you need to provide the audience some closure, even if you imply that things are still dangerous."

Let the atmosphere, tension, and fear come through on the page.,
Keep things as real as possible.,
Spend time on 1-2 big, original, showstopping scenes, usually deaths.,
Toss some humor into the script.,
Listen to horrifying music while you work.",How to Write a Horror Movie3," You cannot just say, ""It will be scary when it is on a screen."" A terrifying scene must be terrifying on the page as well, building suspense that helps the directors, producers, and actors see where the scene is coming. Make the screenplay scary, tense, and atmospheric and the movie will be full of frights.


Read horror writers like Edgar Allen Poe and Steven King to learn about creating tension through words alone.
You may have to bend some screenplay conventions to build a tense, terrifying scene on the page. Remember, however, that your first goal is to write a script that accurately portrays the movie that is eventually made., Horror already pushes the limits of ""suspension of disbelief,"" so don't give your viewers any additional reasons to push the script away. Characters should act realistically, meaning they are afraid for their lives and don't make obviously dumb mistakes like following the killer or ignoring warning signs. The killer should be overpowering, but not so much so that you can't root for the protagonists to ultimately win (even if they don't). Finding realism in horror is mostly about writing realistic characters, but a generally consistent, realistic world, even if it is clearly fictional, will help your scares hit harder., Horror movies live and die based on their signature scenes. Scream is a great movie, but even if it wasn't the opening death would be enough to keep it famous. A great, memorable death will be the signature scene of your movie, and what helps readers remember it for years to come.The entire Final Destination series is built on 4-5 of these moments each movie. While the don't always work, each one has at least one death that viewers will never forget.

Psycho is a great movie, but without the shower scene it likely would have fallen out of collective memory years ago. The scene was so jarring, so surprising, that it is still discussed and satirized today., No one wants to sit in pure tension for two hours, and this ultimately makes the movie's later scares less effective. There is a good reason horror and comedy are so commonly mixed, and that is because they are two sides of the same coin -- surprise. Let a few jokes ease the tension, helping your audience relax here and there while still sitting on the edge of their seat. Humor is also a great way to give a false sense of calm, making the next scare hit even harder.


Pure tension gets old, and eventually doesn't feel tense anymore. Try placing a joke or two shortly after a big scare scene early in the movie. This helps the audience ""get over"" the rush of the first scare, letting you start building tension again for the next one., This doesn't mean you should put Vanilla Ice on. Find horror soundtracks and play them in the background while you write, creating the atmosphere of tension as you work. You can always work in silence as well, but for those looking for a little creative kick you can't go wrong with the Halloween or The Conjuring soundtrack."

Do a variation on a popular video trend.,
Reenact scenes from recent or classic movies.,
Edit other footage.,
Record your pet and add dramatic music.,
Record a prank.",How to Think of Ideas to Make Videos to Put on YouTube1," Harlem Shake videos popped up like flies on the roadkill of the Internet for a hot minute, but it's a little too late to record one now unless all you want is groans. Before that it was ""What girls say"" videos. You've got to beat them to the punch!


Get in on the ground floor. If someone's forwarded you a funny video, change one of the central components of it and record a new version to look as much like the original as possible. Maybe you've got a meme in the making.
What makes the original unique? With Harlem Shake, it was the sudden jump-cut when the beat dropped and the ludicrous dancing. Groups like sports teams and army units made perfect matches with the one-then-a bunch of people transition.;
, Iconic scenes from recent movies are fantastic to include in your own parodies. The video of a mumbling Batman interrogating the Joker was all over YouTube for a minute when the movie was so popular and people were complaining about Batman's comical rasp. Capitalize on a new movie's success and make fun of it at the same time.


Give it a twist to make it your own. Maybe you do a shot-for-shot remake of the restaurant scene from the Godfather, even going so far as to memorize the Italian, but you're all wearing turn-of-the-century one-piece bathing suits and stroking handlebar mustaches. Ok, maybe that's a terrible idea, but put some creative spin on a classic and you'll get some views.

, In programs like Windows Movie Maker and iMovie, you can easily edit existing film and make it your own. If you've got footage from DVDs you've ripped or downloaded from YouTube previously, you can mess with the sound, add subtitles, and make new scenes.


Add subtitles or voice over to old footage. Adding humorous interior monologue to old Chuck Norris flicks is comedy gold. GOLD.
Edit together only the fight scenes from your favorite action movies, or Bond's best one-liners into a great and quick video that'll be funny to watch.
Edit together the comic relief footage from a horror movie to make it look like a family rom-com, or take old footage from family flicks and make it look like a creepy slasher flick.

, One thing about humans is for sure: they love looking at videos of animals, especially the baby versions of animals. And if you add clips from the Pirates of the Caribbean soundtrack, you're on your way to a classic YouTube clip.


Keep toys or treats out of the shot and tease your pet into acting silly. Or record animals interacting, or animals places in awkward circumstances, like on trampolines, in bathtubs, or in boxes.
Wait until your pet is asleep and then wake them up with a camera. Squeefest.
If your pet has a funny voice or an ugly face, all the better.

Execute the agreement.",How to Sell Your Life Story to a Producer," Even if you have no plans to write a full screenplay, a basic outline of your story not only allows you to develop an effective pitch but gives you written material that you can protect through copyright.Your outline can be as detailed or as skeletal as you like. Keep in mind that just because you include a particular fact or detail doesn't necessarily mean it will make it into a feature or television movie, if you end up selling your story.
While your life is chronological, it may not follow the same lines a story would. Think about a story you've heard or a movie you've seen that had a good story line, and map your life story out along similar lines.
A standard movie is broken into three acts, with the characters in the story following a similar trajectory. You may not think of the people in your life as characters, but in the movie of your life story they would be.
Pull out episodes or events from your memory that will serve as a build-up to the ultimate climactic event. Those will make up the first act of your story.
The climax will be the pivotal moment or event that provoked some sort of change, or from which you learned some sort of lesson.
The third act of your story will encompass those events that draw together the climax and provide closure to the entire story.;
, Once you have your outline, you're ready to write your synopsis, which is a one- or two- page document that you'll give to any producer who wants more information about your story after hearing your pitch.Think about a summation of the life story you want to tell in terms of how you would tell it to a friend with whom you were having a cup of coffee or a drink.
The synopsis includes the entire story – the beginning, the middle, and the end – in a very brief way without a lot of details.
Don't worry if you're not a strong writer – it's not as though the synopsis is going to be published. Simply focus on using active language to describe what happens in the story of your life.
Write your synopsis in the third person, and strive to take yourself out of the story as much as possible and look at it from the standpoint of someone else who doesn't know you.
Think about the aspects of your life that would be interesting or gripping to other people – those are the points you want to highlight in your synopsis.

, A logline is a two- or three-sentence summary of your story that entices the person who hears it to hear the whole story and find out what happens. Writing a logline is something of an art, but there are some techniques you can use to create a strong logline that will sell your story.One way to think of a logline is as the punchline to a joke – only without the joke. This is a sentence or two that's going to tell the producers to whom you pitch what your story is about and what viewers ultimately should get out of it.
Imagine if you overheard a punchline but never heard the joke itself. A good punchline would intrigue you and make you want to hear the joke so you could laugh along with everybody else. This is the same thing you're striving to do with your logline: make the producers want to see (meaning make) the whole movie.
You can find examples of these sorts of summaries on many of the film sites online, such as IMDB or Rotten Tomatoes. Read the short summaries of movies you know to get a feel for the type of logline you can use for your life story.
It can help to think about the genre of the story you're trying to tell – would it be a thriller, an adventure, or a romantic comedy? Your logline should be angled toward that genre.
Keep in mind that some stories have elements of several genres, which would lend themselves to several loglines that emphasize each of those themes in turn. If you can't sell your story as a romantic comedy, for example, you might be able to sell it as a drama.

, Even if you're not going to be doing a lot of writing or other creative work yourself, an intellectual property attorney can help you protect your rights and maximize your profits when selling your life story.Particularly if some event in your life has garnered local – or even national – media attention, you may have already received calls from people interested in buying your life rights.
Under no circumstances should you so much as contemplate making a deal with someone to produce your life story without at least talking to an attorney.
Not only can a good copyright attorney help you protect your rights before you start trying to sell your life story to a producer, they can review contracts and make sure you're going to get what you want and be fairly represented in any deal you sign.
If you don't know any copyright or intellectual property attorneys, start your search on the website of your state or local bar association. There should be a searchable directory of attorneys licensed to practice in your area.
Most bar associations also have an intellectual property section for attorneys who specialize in that area of law, so it's a good idea to focus on members of that section.
Don't worry about trying to find a lawyer in L.A. or New York City (unless that's where you happen to live) – a local attorney will be easier for you to keep in touch with and may have lower rates.

, If you're not writing the story yourself but you still want to sell it to a producer, what you'll really be selling is your life rights. These agreements encompass a number of rights, but basically protect the producer from being sued by you for defamation or invasion of privacy.You can find examples of life rights contracts online, or if you've hired an attorney they may have a few samples to go over with you.
Keep in mind that when you sign a life rights contract to sell your life story, this means the producer – or the writers or directors they hire – will have the right to change various aspects of your story if they believe it would make a stronger film.
By selling your life rights, you lose the ability to sue the producer or anyone else associated with the film for defamation or invasion of privacy if you end up having problems or disagreements with the way your life is portrayed on film.
These are serious issues that you should think long and hard about before you decide you want to sell your life story to a producer. While you may have some control over the story, in most cases you'll have to give up all rights or the producer will simply walk.

, While you can't copyright an idea or a true story, you can copyright anything that's written down. Since a movie of your life isn't literally your life, you can copyright the treatment, synopsis, and any other written material you have.You can register your outline (also known in film circles as a ""treatment"") and synopsis for copyright protection by visiting the U.S. Copyright Office's website at copyright.gov.
If you file your application online, copyright registration is only $35 and protects the words themselves as you've written them, as well as derivative works.
This means no one can make a film based on your outline or synopsis without your permission, or you can sue them for copyright infringement.
Keep in mind you can't sue anyone for copyright infringement in federal court unless you have a registered copyright.
Since it's your life story, you may have a state lawsuit for invasion of privacy or defamation, depending on the content of the film. However, if you got significant publicity as a result of the events that are recounted in the film, you have a higher burden of proof that is substantially more difficult to meet than the burden of proof for private individuals.
These written materials also can be registered with the Writer's Guild of America for a similar amount of money, which provides them with additional protection in the film community.
While registration may be one of the simplest and cheapest things you do to protect your story, it also may turn out to be the most important – especially as you start sharing your story with producers you hope will adapt it for film.

, Nearly everyone thinks something has happened in their life that would make a good movie or television show, and yet relatively few life stories are actually purchased by producers. Those that are typically already have demonstrated interest and popular appeal.Many movies or television specials based on true life stories happen because the producers optioned the film rights for a biography or autobiography that was already a bestseller.
For this reason, it's almost always a good bet if you want to sell your life story to a producer to get it out in print first.
A bestselling book may seem out of your reach, but you may be able to hire a ghost writer and put out a self-published book for a few thousand dollars.
If a book seems out of your reach, you might want to look to local or regional interest publications to start garnering media attention for your story.
Build a presence on social media and attract friends and followers with tales from your life that you'd ultimately like to see made into a movie.
Keep in mind that producers ultimately are fairly conservative people when it comes to buying stories and making movies. The more you can demonstrate that there's already a proven demand for you and your story, the better chance you have of selling your life story to a producer.

, The markets you find and the producers to whom you pitch your life story are going to vary depending on what you imagine your future role to be in the production, and what skills you bring to the table.For example, if you want to write the screenplay, it might be a good idea to go ahead and get started. You probably will have better odds getting a producer to bite if there's already a script, even if it's one that will need a lot of work.
If there are specific actors you imagine playing roles in the movie of your life story, you might want to consider getting in touch with their agents and getting them on board with the project first. It can be good to have someone ""inside Hollywood"" in your corner, not to mention the fact that actors often produce movies as well.
Generally speaking, you'll have a better chance at selling your story if you've got something – whether that's a particular actor who's attached or a working screenplay – than if you've got nothing but an idea.
If you want control over the movie or a final okay on the finished product, you probably will have to settle for less money in exchange.
You also should keep in mind that producers typically will be reticent to have any significant degree of input from someone with little to no knowledge or experience in making movies.

, Look at your story from the point of view of a producer, and find the elements that would attract those who create films or television shows of the genre where your life story best fits.For example, if you're a middle-aged woman who has gone through a harrowing or traumatic relationship or life crisis, you may want to try your luck with television networks such as Lifetime that frequently produce television movies based on true life stories.
To find producer's names, look up films that are similar to the film you think could be made from your life story. Find out the production companies and the names of the producers, then search for ways to query them.
You'll want to build a lengthy list of producers to whom you want to pitch before you start, because you have to assume that most, if not all, of them won't even respond to your initial pitch.

, Find producers who have open calls for scripts or who are specifically looking for true life stories to make into movies or television shows. Start with them and draft a simple cover letter to introduce yourself.Never send a full script, or even a synopsis, to a producer or anyone else unsolicited. Thick packages containing scripts often will simply be thrown in the trash unopened, because no one wants to risk being exposed to the content and potentially ending up in a copyright infringement lawsuit because they produce an unrelated film with substantially similar elements.
Introduce yourself in your cover letter, provide your logline and maybe another sentence or two about your life story – but that's it. The shorter, the better.
Include a sentence or two describing the publicity you've received as a result of your story, either in the press or through a published biography.
Close your letter by encouraging the person to whom you're writing to contact you if they're interested in hearing more, and then wait for them to come to you.
If you have newspaper clippings, you may want to include a copy of one or two short stories to show the level of public interest in your story.
Be prepared to send many of these letters out and never hear anything back from anyone. You may want to follow up by making a phone call or sending an email, but don't hound them.
If you don't hear anything back, it's safe to assume they're not interested. Strike that name off your list and move on to the next one.

, Most producers will purchase an option on your work instead of buying the product outright. When a producer purchases an option, they are purchasing the exclusive right to your life story for a specified period of time. During this ""rental"" period the producer will work to develop the product (e.g., creating a budget, getting actors lines up, getting a screenplay). Also, during this period, you will not be able to sell or option the rights to your life story to anyone else.Option contracts can be a great way to earn money without having to give up all the rights in your life story (unless the option is exercised).
However, option contracts take your ability to advertise and sell your product elsewhere for a specific period of time. Some producers will purchase options on works to simply take them off the market so it can't be made by someone else., Because most producers prefer to purchase options on life stories, try to find a producer who genuinely cares about the story you are pitching. Set up meetings with various producers in the industry and make your best pitch to each one. During your discussion, look for signs of the producer's genuineness. For example:


See what plans the producer has for your project. Ask about the sort of budget the producer thinks is feasible. Ask for the producer's thoughts on casting. The more answers the producer has, the more serious they are about making the project a reality.
Try to find out what other projects the producer has options on with a similar subject matter. If the producer already holds rights to a project similar to yours., they may want to purchase an option to shut your project down.

, When you find a producer interested in purchasing an option to your work, you need to decide how long the option will last. The option period should last long enough to allow the producer to do their due diligence on the project. However, you also want the option period to be short enough so you can keep shopping if you need to. In general, option periods are around one year.


Most option contracts also include a provision allowing the producer to extend the option period for another year. In some cases, your contract might include multiple extension periods.A common option provision might state: ""The option shall be effective during the period commencing on the date hereof and ending one year later (the “Initial Option Period”). The Initial Option Period may be extended for an additional six months by payment of One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) on or before the Initial Option Period expiration date."", In exchange for the producer's exclusive right to develop and purchase your life story, the producer will pay you a sum of money called an ""option payment"". The amount of this payment will depend on whether there are competitive stories in the market place, whether you are represented by an agent, and the length of the option period.


When you agree on an amount, it will be paid when the option contract is signed. This amount will either be folded into the purchase price (if the producer exercises their option) or will be separate. In general, the first option payment is often folded into the purchase price while subsequent extension payments are not.A common price provision may look like this: ""In consideration of payment of One Thousand Dollars ($1,000), Writer hereby grants the Producer a six (6) month exclusive option to purchase all motion picture, television, ancillary and exploitation rights in and to the Property, in order to develop and produce an original motion picture based on the Property, provided that any sums paid under this Section shall be credited against the first sums payable on account of such purchase price."", If the producer develops the project and wants to purchase the rights to your life story, they will need to exercise the contract's option. An option can be exercised in various ways including paying a purchase price or starting production. Your contract should lay out all the ways in which the producer can exercise the option.


Your exercise provision might read: ""Producer may exercise this Option at any time during the Option Period, as it may be extended, by giving written notice of such exercise to Owner and delivery to Owner of the Purchase Price."", One of the most important provisions in your option contract is the purchase price of your work. If the producer exercises their option to purchase your work, they will have to pay this negotiated price to you. In most option contracts, the purchase price is either a fixed price (i.e., $250,000) or a percentage of the project's budget (i.e., if the budget is between $500,000 and $1,000,000, the purchase price shall be $10,000)., The last important piece of your contract will be your reversion rights. If the producer fails to exercise their option within the agreed upon time, you want to make sure all rights to the project revert back to you. Therefore, include something similar to the following in your contract:""If the Producer does not timely exercise the option during its original or extended term, the option shall terminate and all rights in the Property shall immediately revert to the Writer. The Writer shall retain all sums paid.""

, Once all the provisions of your contract have been negotiated, you both will sign the option agreement. At this point the producer will have the exclusive right to develop your project. You will not be able to sell or option the work to anyone else until the rights have reverted back to you.

Understand what makes a great idea in Hollywood.,
Create a clever log line.,
Draft up a synopsis.,
Get the rights of anything based on a real event or person.",How to Sell Your Idea to Hollywood1," Development executives, the people who review ideas and choose what gets made, are constantly bombarded with ideas. To stand out you need to know what kind of ideas are going to capture their attention. While there is no perfect formula for an idea, there are some common threads among the best ideas:



Originality: The hardest, but most crucial, factor of any idea. Luckily, pure originality isn't necessary. You want something that looks like it could sell -- a new mix-up of old ideas, a beloved book or story that hasn't been filmed, a new perspective people haven't seen, etc.

Projected Cost: Especially if this is your first idea, you'll generally want to steer away from the enormous, effects-driven blockbusters. Few studios will risk hundreds of millions of dollars on an unproven filmmaker. You're better off using fewer characters and simpler settings whenever possible.

A Screenplay/Proof of Concept: Do you just have the idea, or do you have something to back it up? This can be a screenplay or a short film, but it is essential nonetheless. The idea will get you in the door, but it is the content that will get the movie/show made.;
, A log line is a single sentence that outlines the basic premise and hook of your concept. It details the characters, plot, and setting briefly so that you can interest someone in the idea with just 1-2 sentences. Keep it as short and dynamic as possible. Some ideas from famous movies include:



Back to the Future: Marty, a high school student, is accidentally transported to the past, where his parents are at risk of never falling in love -- or creating him!Jaws: A police chief with a phobia for open water battles a killer shark. But the greedy town board refuses to admit there is a problem at the beach at all.

Ratatouille: A Parisian rat secretly teams up with an untalented chef to prove that anyone can cook, though jealous critics and pest-control think otherwise., Synopsis are 1-3 page documents that tell your entire story/first season, beat for beat. You want to include the genre (Romantic Comedy, Action) the characters, and the plot in quick, concise, and engaging prose. For reality shows, this is a breakdown of the setting, people, and possible plot lines to follow. This is easier said than done, but a good synopsis will contain:


As few words as possible. Get to the point, and get out. You want to tell the story clearly and quickly, so avoid long, unnecessary things like ""Gary is tall, blond and young, but he look like he is 50. He likes to smoke and listen to rock and roll, and..."" These details are unnecessary and will likely all change.
Action verbs and phrases. Avoid, ""she does this,"" ""he responds with,"" and other overused or nondescript verbs. Aim for powerful, action-oriented verbs, like ""she battles,"" ""he retorts with,"" whenever possible.
Characters. You don't want a list of plot elements, you want a movie. Characters drive audience investment in film and TV, so don't forget about them. The plot should be sparked by your characters, not the other way around., Having the rights to something is often the difference between a deal and the door. Luckily, they are actually easy to get. Development executives often comment that they want things ""Based on a True Story."" Owning someone's ""Life Rights,"" means that you can't get sued for making a movie based on their ""true"" story. Just as importantly, you get the exclusive rights to make the movie or TV show, as only one person can hold the rights to something at once. Usually, you buy life rights cheaply, sometimes for $1, and then split profits once the show or movie is made.


Life rights can include biographies, such as getting a musician's life rights or the rights to the people involved in a large murder trial.
Life rights can also include reality shows. Find a compelling family, mini-celebrity, or person worth exploring every day. A cheap set of life rights may turn them into a lucrative show.

If you want to adapt a book, you must purchase the rights before selling your idea. To do so, contact the publisher located in the front of the book."

Research current networks and development reports.,
Create a ""hit-list"" of appropriate companies to approach.,
Network with everyone you can.,
Consider sending your idea through a pitching service.,
Make the idea into a movie/show yourself.",How to Sell Your Idea to Hollywood2," Subscribe to Hollywood trade publications (""the trades"") and websites, like the ubiquitous Deadline.com (a must-read), to get a handle on what's being developed and produced by a studio or network. For example, Deadline reported last year that NBC was pushing big on medical dramas. What does that mean for you? That this year medical dramas are a lot less likely to sell, as NBC is currently developing 5-6 of them.


Visit the directories to get the complete list of industry contacts, cross-referenced by company, name, and show, and keep notes of names that are frequently attached to projects like yours.

, Once you know what studios are producing similar ideas make a list of all the relevant companies. Find out if they accept unsolicited pitches. The best way to do this is through their website. Find phone numbers, emails for assistants, and anything that talks about idea generation (such as ""how to pitch"").


This is largely a matter of common sense. You wouldn't pitch a cheesy monster movie to NBC, you'd send it to SyFy. You wouldn't send over a period drama to Judd Apatow's production company. Think about what the studio is already making to pitch to the right people.Many studios have fellowship programs. These are paid 6-8 week programs that help you develop and hone your ideas. They are, however, incredibly competitive and pay very little.

, Meeting people is still the number one way to sell an idea. Whenever you meet someone who is even tangentially involved in making films, set up a time to get coffee together. Even if this person isn't able to make your idea a reality, they may know someone who can. That said, do not make friends simply to try and get famous -- just be your normal, friendly self and offer up your ideas organically.


When possible, work on film and TV sets as a production assistant or intern. You'll meet many industry contacts who may need a new idea for their next project.
If you've published before, or have industry experience, you could consider hiring an agent, though it is not strictly necessary.
While not strictly necessary, selling your idea to Hollywood is easiest if you're in Hollywood. If you're serious, it's time to move to LA.

, These sites, which charge you a nominal fee to host and ""directly"" pitch your idea to development executives, have a spotty track record. Yet some of them, like The Blacklist, have launched careers and ideas before. Be sure to thoroughly vet a pitching service before sending them money.


Research any of their ""success stories"" online and on IMDB to see how the projects went.
Search for online testimonials. Many screenwriting and film sites allow people to comment on the effectiveness of an company.
Get and keep verification and proof of your idea from any company you send to. This can prevent theft later on and make sure your idea stays yours.

, If you show someone a trailer or a short cut of footage, you immediately capture their attention and show that you mean business. This is a great way to get funding as well, and it is always easier to get funding if you already have it. Some ideas include:


A crowd-sourcing campaign to shoot your first episode, scene, or promo.
A blog detailing your work on the idea.
Storyboard, scripts, or animatics.

"
Know that you'll need an effective pitch to sell your idea.,
Become a salesperson, not a writer.,
Pitch quickly and energetically.,
Have 4-5 more ideas on hand.,
Hire an entertainment lawyer to review any deal before signing.",How to Sell Your Idea to Hollywood3," More likely than not, you'll need to pitch your idea again once Hollywood executives bring you in. There are a lot of different stages that need to OK your idea before it gets made, and not all them have time for advance research on your idea. You need to enter ready to knock them out.


You should always prepare your pitch and practice it well in advance. Your idea was revised and honed to perfection, your pitch needs to be, too.

, Development execs hear hundreds of ideas a day, and they are often phrased: ""I have a good idea, I'm a good writer, and the world is ready to hear it."" While this may be true, you are not defending your art, you are selling it. You should be talking about why they need to buy it. How does your idea benefit them and their viewers? Why is it the right fit for them? Check your ego at the door and become a salesperson if you want success.


This is where your research comes in handy. You need to know what kind of movies/shows the company produces, and who its audience is, to best capture its attention., Your pitch should fit in under 5-10 minutes. These people do not have a ton of time, and they hear a lot of pitches each day. You want to make sure you capture their attention immediately get to the point shortly after. A good structure to consider includes:



A Hook: How do you grab their attention? This is usually with the log-line you developed ahead of time-- the one sentence hook that describes your show or movie and draws people in. A good way to think of this is, ""What is the ""What if?"" of your idea?""The Audience: Who is this show marketed to? How does it fit perfectly into the network or studio's existing audience?

The ""Trailer:"" Think of any great movie trailer. What are the elements that make you want to go buy a ticket? Come up with these moments, the selling points, for your idea, and use them to paint a fuller picture of your movie or show.

The Budget (Optional): If you are convinced that you know the budget, roughly, for the show/movie, bring it along. Especially if it is low. This shows you know how the production game works, and that you can give a specific dollar amount on the deal. Again, this is only effective if the idea is low-budget., A development exec may like your voice and idea but pass on the show for a variety of reasons. In this event, they will usually ask some variation of ""do you have anything else you're working on?"" This is not the time to freeze up, it's the time to have a few more ideas in the tank to test out. Never walk in with all of your ideas in one egg basket, as this will severely limit your chances of signing a deal., You may have heard about ""getting an agent,"" but you want a lawyer nearby for the deal. Agents take 10% of the cut and have no legal experience in deal-making, while an entertainment lawyer has vast experience in contract negotiations. Most lawyers will take a nominal fee with minimal participation in any additional revenues. Some will just take a cut of the option money and 5% of all revenues.

",How to Shoot a Movie Entirely in One Take,";
, First, you must come up with an idea for the movie. Then, you must figure out a way to interpret that idea into a plot that doesn't require any jumping to certain periods in time. Make sure there are absolutely no plot holes.

, It's like dancing, but with lines.

, They must be very good actors, too. It's very hard to pretend to be scared for almost and hour and a half. It can be very taxing on their emotions and psyche. Give them the script you've written, and then comes the rehearsal.

, Rehearsing is definitely something you're going to need to do. Make sure you've rehearsed until everyone knows what to do, what to say, and when to do or say anything. But don't burn these people out! Maybe rehearse about 4 times a day if you have absolutely nothing else to do. Then they can go home. But don't rehearse all day! People will get very frustrated and tired, and that's when their acting becomes very dull and boring.

, If not, use a Steadicam, or some other camera stabilizing system. Using a Steadicam takes a lot of practice, so make sure you spend a lot of time prior to making the movie. But not just any camera will do! Make sure it's a very fluid camera, so audiences won't suspect any hidden cuts, even if there are. At least 50 fps (frames per second) is good. HD will be a good thing to use. But, you don't have to make the movie traditional. You can go with found footage, or maybe even strap some cameras to each actor's heads so you can see from each and every point of view in a split screen, like the movie Timecode. Or like Vantage Point.

, If you shoot the lights off and use nothing but head-mounted cameras and flashlights, the movie will be scary! Or, you could open a few unseen windows (like skylights, for example) for a cool-colored theme. Or let in as much sun as possible to get a warm feeling.

, For instance, replace your windows with sugar glass, breakaway glass, or tempered stunt glass so if anyone goes though a window, the glass will (easily) break into very small pebbles, instead of shards that could cut someone like a normal window! Make sure the window is very close to the ground, and that the actor is on a harness pulled by people off screen. You can get stunt glass pretty much anywhere on the Internet or in special stores. If you're going to be doing any other stunts, like smashing someone into a wall, or a bunch of cabinets, make sure the material breaks easily and doesn't hurt in any way! And make the actor give subtle signs that s/he's okay. Always replace items in your house with breakable look-alikes. Put your own possessions in storage somewhere safe.

, Drink lots of tea, or warm beverages. No milk/dairy. Dairy coats your vocal cords and makes it hard to scream/sing/yell. Always push from your stomach, not your throat.

, Not too cliché, but not too confusing. If there was no twist, there would be no climax, and ultimately no plot. Any climax without a twist becomes very, very boring.

, It's a lot of fun to see the end result!

, If you're looking to make money off of it, sell the movie to studio like MGM, Paramount, etc. If the whole movie was just for fun, YouTube is just fine for something like that.

, But, if you're lazy and want the film to only look like one take, while still being divided into scenes, you might have to do some very clever editing. Most professional video editors cost from $100-$300.

, This step is optional. If you're not so sure about how good your acting skills are, get in front of a mirror and practice to yourself. (Just make sure that siblings and/or parents in the house know what you're doing, so they won't assume you've gone crazy.)

, Invite friends and family to join you. No movie is complete without a cast!

, You'll need a make-up artist to make them look like the character they're replacing; a camera-man (make sure they are very good at holding the camera still-that can immensely affect the quality of your video); and any other people you think necessary.

, Time to play dress up. Is your character Anakin from ""Star Wars""? Make sure he's got blonde-ish hair, maybe a little braid to the side, a robe, etc.

, Start acting. Make yourself feel as if you ARE that person. Imagine if you were in their place. Work on facial expression. That is one of the most important parts of acting-especially on close-ups!

, Use Windows Movie Maker, or that one that came with your camera. Put all the mini videos together, and, VOILA! You have yourself a reenacted movie by you and your friends!

After washing, apply a light facial lotion for sensitive skin. Wait to apply the makeup for at least thirty minutes to make sure the moisturizer completely soaks in.
If your child has dry skin, use a cotton ball to apply a thin layer alcohol free toner before doing their makeup.;
, Foundation is a kind of makeup for your skin that mimics your skin tone. Choose a shade that is one or two shades darker than your child’s face even if they already have a very dark skin tone. Otherwise, they may look washed-out on stage. Use a compressed pancake foundation instead of liquid foundation as it won’t streak or rub off if your child gets sweaty under the stage lights. Apply the pancake foundation with sponge or soft brush, starting with the cheeks and blending outward.








Make sure to blend the makeup into their neck and hairline. Otherwise your child may look like they’re wearing a mask.
You don’t need to buy an expensive makeup brand. Any brand that is made for sensitive skin will work fine.

, Blush will help give your child’s face a healthy glow on stage. Choose a shade that’s slightly darker than your child’s normal cheek color. Stay away from dark purples and bright oranges; choose a natural shade instead. Ask your child to smile and apply the blush to the apples of their cheeks. Blend the blush across their cheekbones and towards their ears.









Use a large soft brush to apply the blush.
The blush will look slightly unnatural if you choose the correct shade. However, the bright colors and contrast will look great on stage. Remember, people will be viewing your child from a distance.

, Translucent powder is a loose, clear powder that helps makeup stay on your face. Some translucent powders come with “illuminators,” causing the makeup to look shiny when you put it on. Avoid powders that have illuminators as they will make your child shine like a beacon onstage. When applying the powder, start from the cheeks and gently brush the powder all over the rest of the face.









Apply the powder in a thin layer. If it’s too thick your child’s skin will look strange and powdery.
Use a large, soft brush to apply the powder.

, Choose a light gold or peach eyeshadow that has a bit of shimmer. Apply this shade over the whole eyelid with a small makeup brush. Blend the color up towards the eyebrows. Next, choose a darker, natural color such as a chocolate brown. Apply a line of darker eyeshadow to the crease of the eyelid. Using a clean eyeshadow brush, blend the dark line of eyeshadow into the lighter eyeshadow.When blending with a brush use light, gentle strokes. If you press too hard you may scrub away the eyeshadow.
If your child has blond or light brown eyebrows, use a light brown eyeshadow to fill them in.

, Use a black pencil to line the top and bottom of your child’s eye. To line the top lid first ask the child to close their eyes. Gently pull up on the eyebrow and apply the makeup in small strokes, lining the lash line of the eyelid. To line the lower lid, ask the child to look up. Gently pull down on the cheek to put on the lower line.









Be patient and careful while applying the makeup; if you get it in their eyes, they might start watering and mess up the makeup.
Have younger child lean against wall or lie on floor to reduce fidgeting.

, Use black mascara that’s not waterproof. Waterproof mascara is very difficult to clean off of a child’s face. Gently pull up on eyebrow and ask the child to look down. Apply a thin coat of mascara to the ends of their eyelashes. Let the mascara dry before applying some to the lower lashes. When doing lower lashes, ask the child to look up and gently pull down on their cheek.








Be patient. If you move too quickly or don’t let the child blink when they want to they might become uncooperative.
It may help to lean the child against a wall to reduce fidgeting.

, Choose a shade of lipstick and lip liner that’s a few shades darker than their natural lip tone. First, line their lips with lip liner by carefully drawing a thin line around the edges of their lips. Next, apply the lipstick. Ask the child to open their mouth in a loose “O” shape and carefully dab the lipstick onto their lips. Blend it all over their lips using your finger.









Lip liner is optional, but it helps keep the lipstick in place.
If the lipstick is too thick dab some of it off with a tissue. This is called “blotting.”

, If you accidentally smear the child’s makeup while you’re applying it, simply wipe the affected area with a baby wipe. Wait for the area to dry and reapply the makeup completely. For example, if you smear mascara onto your child’s cheek, it’s not enough to wipe away the mascara. You must also reapply the foundation and the blush, finishing with translucent powder.


This technique is best for quickly removing small mistakes. The longer the makeup sits on the face, the harder it will be to get off with baby wipes.

, Choose a mild facial cleanser that is formulated for sensitive skin. Gently splash the child’s face with water while standing over a sink. Put a pea-sized amount of the facial cleanser in your hand. Rub your hands together to create a thick lather and gently rub the lather on the child’s skin. Avoid the eye areas. After a few minutes wash the soap off with warm water and pat their skin dry.Use gentle makeup wipes to remove eye makeup. To do so, ask the child to close their eyes and wipe the makeup off in a downward motion. Be careful not to get makeup in their eyes.
If you’re concerned about irritated skin, apply a gentle, non-scented lotion after washing their face.

, If your child has very sensitive skin you may not want to use a cleanser at all. If this is the case, use coconut oil instead. First, rub a teaspoon of coconut oil all over your child’s face, avoiding the eyes. Next, use a warm damp washcloth to wipe away the makeup. When wiping away the eye makeup, ask the child to close their eyes and gently wipe the makeup away in a downward motion. If there is a lot of makeup you may need more than one teaspoon of coconut oil.
Wrap a towel around the child’s shoulders to avoid dripping coconut oil on their clothing.

Choose a helmet that will serve as your baby bump.Don’t use any helmets that have a facemask that will make your belly look bumpy and strange.,
Apply masking tape over the top of your helmet to hide the ridges.,
Secure or remove any hanging straps on the helmet.,
Attach the helmet to your torso.,
Wear a shirt that complements your fake pregnancy belly.",How to Create a Fake Pregnancy Belly1," A bicycle helmet will probably work best for this. They come in many different shapes, any of which should work just fine as a fake belly — but try out a few different shapes, if you have options, to see which one makes the most convincing baby bump in your opinion.;
, You don’t want your belly to look bumpy, so make sure to apply as many layers of tape as necessary to render the helmet completely smooth. By the time you’re finished, there should be no evidence of ridges left.

, If you’re not planning on using the helmet for anything else, you can just cut the straps off carefully with a pair of sharp scissors. That might be a waste of a good helmet, though! You can also just tuck the straps inside the helmet, then use a little bit of the masking tape to tape it to the dome, making sure they stay put and don’t hang out the bottom of fake belly.

, There are a few different ways you can try to keep your helmet in place, and you might even try a combination of a couple of these ideas. You don’t want your belly sliding around or falling off!


Tightly wrap an elastic athletic bandage (like an Ace bandage) several times around the helmet and your back. Use as many layers as you need to secure the helmet and make the bump look smooth when a shirt is pulled down over it.
Secure the helmet with some of the masking tape from step 2.
Layer a few tight bandeaus over the helmet to keep it in place.

, If your shirt is too tight, it might be obvious that the belly is shaped a little strangely. It’s better to choose a looser, flowier shirt.

Practice your storytelling skills.,
Use signposts.,
Be specific.,
Be ready for questions.,
Don't be offended if you get interrupted.,
Make notes, but try not to use them.",How to Pitch a Movie1," That is, you are trying to sell a story, so you want to create a vivid image of it for the the producers or executives. Treat your pitch like a story your telling a group of friends.


Speak with the correct inflections. Don't downplay a dramatic part of your pitch by mumbling through it. When you're practicing giving your pitch, add inflections where necessary to emphasize the story. Get louder and faster as the story gets more exciting and softer, though still clear-spoken when the story enters a tender moment.Don't be afraid to use hand gestures. They can add emphasis to your story and help get your point across. Just be sure they are appropriate. For instance, for a quiet, important part of the pitch, you may want to keep your body still.Practice for people you know. Ask them for advice on how to make your story telling better.;
, Guide your listeners through your story by offering up signals of where you've been and where you're going, using phrases such as ""Halfway through the story..."" or ""near the end."" These clue the executives in to where you are in your plot., Your language is creating the story for the executives, so use precise, specific language.For instance, instead of saying ""The opening scene is in an Asian country.,"" say something such as ""The scene opens in Tokyo on a steamy morning, as the streets are just beginning to fill with people walking and riding their bikes to work.""

, For instance, the movie executive may ask you about who you think should be cast in your movie. Try not to step on any toes. That is, you can name a few people who would be good in the main character's role, but you should mention that you are open to other ideas, since the executive will have a better idea of who's available and who's trending., Movie executives are busy people, so they may need to take a call or text during the pitch. Let them take the time they need, and don't get flustered. Just resume where you left off., If you get lost, you definitely want a backup. However, executives will be more impressed if you can give a pitch without referring to your notes."

Choose two blankets that are medium thickness and size.,
Fold Blanket 1 into a diamond.,
Ball up Blanket 2 to create the bulk of your fake belly.,
Fold Blanket 1 around Blanket 2.,
Attach the blankets to your torso.,
Put a shirt on over the fake belly, and you're done.",How to Create a Fake Pregnancy Belly2," They should be about the size and weight of a throw blanket — not as large as a bed sheet, not as thin as a bed sheet, and not as thick as a comforter or quilt. These two blankets will make up the bulk of your baby belly.


Avoid throw blankets that have a long fringe on them, as it might make your belly look weird.

, This will be the outer layer of your belly, and you’ll use it to smooth out and add dimension.


Lay the blanket flat on the ground or on a wide surface like a bed or tabletop.
Carefully fold each of the four corners toward the center of the blanket until all four corners touch. Remember making origami fortune tellers as a child? Imagine you’re doing the first folding step with this blanket.
The result should be an uneven diamond or a square, depending on what shape your original blanket was. Don’t worry if it’s not a perfect square — that doesn’t matter.

, It shouldn’t be a perfect circle, but a little wide, to better imitate the shape of a pregnancy. When you ball it up, make sure one side remains flat and sooth while the other side hides all the edges. You’ll want to face the smooth side out so people can’t tell your belly is really blankets!

, By combining both blankets, you’re adding dimension to your belly, but you want to make sure it’s believable. Do this step carefully so that your belly won’t start coming undone after a few minutes of wearing it.


Place Blanket 2 in the center of Blanket 1.
Take the four external corners of Blanket 1 (not the four that are already touching in the center) and fold them over the bulk of Blanket 2, creating a little cover around it.
Secure the ends together with masking tape, using enough tape to guarantee that the ends won’t come loose.

, You can follow the same basic procedure as attaching the helmet to your torso in the previous method.


Tightly wrap an elastic athletic bandage (like an Ace bandage) several times around the blankets and your back, using as many layers as you need to secure the belly and make it look smooth.
Secure the blankets with some of the masking tape.
Layer a few tight bandeaus over the blankets to keep them in place.

, Although the blanket won't have the hard ridge that a helmet might, it might still look a little lumpy if you weren't able to get it as smooth as you would have liked, so it's probably still best to wear a looser shirt.

Choose a beach ball that’s appropriately sized.These balls come in all sizes, so you want to choose one that’s not too small or too enormous.,
Inflate the beach ball about half-way.,
Secure the beach ball to your torso.,
Wear a loose-fitting shirt over top the beach ball, and you’re ready to go.",How to Create a Fake Pregnancy Belly3," The “standard” beach ball size will likely work best for this project.

, Blow into the air spigot, making sure not to let any air escape, until the ball is about half to three-quarters of the way inflated. You can adjust this to how big you want your belly to be.


If you want a huge belly, then go ahead and inflate the ball all the way. It will look cartoonishly large for a pregnancy, but that might be what you’re going for with your costume.

, Again, you can use ace bandages, bandeaus, or tank tops to do this. Because a beach ball doesn’t have nearly as much weight as a helmet or two blankets, you won’t have to work so hard to keep it in place — a single tight bandeau or tank top should do the trick.


Make sure to point the air nozzle down toward the ground. If it points out or up, it will be noticeable through your shirt, and if it points back toward you, it will irritate your skin and start hurting after a little while.

, With this method, you might even be able to get away with a tighter shirt! Try out a few different shirts and see which one goes best with your fake belly.

Keep it very short.,
Be confident.,
Hook your audience.,
Include the characters in the first sentence.,
Show the conflict.,
Introduce the world.,
Don't resolve everything.",How to Pitch a Movie2," This pitch should be two to three sentences, lasting 1 to 2 minutes at most.Some experts call this pitch an ""elevator pitch"" because you should be able to say it in the time it takes to ride an elevator.

, If you apologize or say you don't believe in your story with your body language, you won't get anyone else to believe in it either., The pitch should interest movie executives as quickly as possible.In other words, tell the most interesting part of the story.

, The first sentence should name the primary character or characters.For example, you could say something to this effect: ""Jessica Reese has had her heart broken too many times, until she falls for Joe Smith.""

, The teaser needs to establish what the main conflict will be. Maybe your main conflict is a girl is trying to date a boy who doesn't seem to like her, or maybe your main conflict is a super villain trying to take over the world.For example, in the second sentence should show at least some of the conflict: ""Jessica Reese has had her heart broken too many times, until she falls for Joe Smith. The problem is, he's the commander on her space ship, while she's a lowly ensign.""

, The context of your story is the world your characters are living in. An 18th-century French drama is in a very different world than a 26th-century space adventure.Notice in the example above that you've keyed your listener into the fact that it's set in space, is in the science fiction genre, and that it's likely set in the future.

, That is, your audience should want to know more about your project from your pitch.For instance, at the end of this pitch, you could add: ""Jessica Reese has had her heart broken too many times, until she falls for Joe Smith. The problem is, he's the commander on her space ship, while she's a lowly ensign. Jessica will stop at nothing to win his love... and endanger everyone in the process.""

Be personable.,
Hook your audience.,
Still keep it relatively short.,
Don't try to tell the whole story.,
Don't forget the genre.,
Tell a story.,
Let your characters drive the pitch.,
Know the best part of your story.,
Don't preach.,
Use the best comparisons.,
Stop when you get an answer.,
End on a high note.,
Ask for questions.",How to Pitch a Movie3," You're trying to build a relationship with the people you're pitching you're movie to, as well as tell them a story. You want them to love you as much as they love your script. Take some time at the beginning to have a conservation with them.Don't drag on too long. They won't appreciate you wasting extra time.
For instance, when you go into the room, if you know what the producers have done in the past, you can compliment them on their work: ""You worked on , didn't you? I loved the dark, gritty feel of that movie, which is why I wanted to pitch my movie to you.""

, This piece of advice holds true whether you're giving a short or long pitch. The first sentence should quickly draw your audience into the story.Hooks always have something a little bit different or something that counters expectations. As an example, you could say something such as ""Jessica Reese is a scientist who knows everything from engine mechanics to quantum physics, but you're just as likely to catch her delivering flowers to crew mates as you are to see her huddled over a math problem.""

, The long pitch, or story pitch, should be under 10 minutes or so., Keep it to the main characters and plot points. You don't want your audience to get bogged down in the pitch.For instance, only name a few characters in your pitch. Anymore than three or four, and it's going to be overwhelming., The genre provides a background to your story, giving your listeners an idea of what kind of film you want to make.Also, make sure you know your genre. Movie executives expect certain things from each genre, and though you may be able to play with those elements somewhat, you still need to have certain elements in your story. Bring those elements to the forefront when you're pitching your story., Don't just list the plot of your story. Make them believe in the story.For example, don't just say ""Joe meets Sarah. They adopt a dog together. They get married."" Instead, say something such as ""Joe catches Sarah's eye across a crowded coffee shop. Sarah doesn't seem interested, so Joe moves on. Later, though, they bond when Sarah trips and Joe catches her. Their first date is at a pet adoption agency because they both love animals but don't think they have time for them. Sarah takes home a puppy anyway, against her better judgement, which becomes their puppy and even carries the ring at their wedding.""

, Characters are where people connect to the story. Tell about their motivation and what kind of world they're in. Characters draw people into the story., That is, what is going to make it most appealing to an audience? Play that up in your pitch., Tell your story, not what social justice issue you're trying to resolve in the world.As an example, don't include lines such as ""Sarah is suffering under the patriarchy, and she really comes to her own as a feminist"" unless the movie actually is a pseudo-documentary about a feminist. Instead, let your story show how women can be strong characters and work toward a better society.

, If you use comparisons to other films, make sure you don't use movies that didn't do well at the box office. Also, be sure to choose films that actually do match your movie style and tone.Some experts advise against using comparisons. However, the executives are probably going to be making comparisons in their heads anyway, so it doesn't hurt to throw out a couple of movies that are similar. You could say that your movie is somewhere between ""Waitress"" and ""Sex and the City,"" as an example, for a movie that's about a strong, independent woman who comes into her own in a quirky small town and isn't afraid to show her sexuality., Whether it's ""yes"" or ""no,"" stop pitching if you already have an answer. If the answer was ""no,"" you don't want to annoy them because you may be able to pitch another movie to them in the future. If the answer is ""yes,"" you've already won, so stop trying to convince them., Leave the executives with a tidbit that is smart or funny at the end to help sum up your script., You can even ask in the middle of pitching, especially if someone looks like he or she doesn't understand."

Make your story can stand on its own.,
Ensure your script escalates.,
Cut what doesn't move the story forward.,
Proofread it yourself.,
Have other people proofread it.,
Always leave them wanting more.",How to Pitch a Movie4," The concept should be original and interesting. It should be something that could be sustained throughout a movie and work well visually., That is, your story should progress through it's conflict up to a climax. Through most of the story, it should be escalating in conflict and excitement., A scene must do something, such as introduce a character, establish a relationship, or move the story forward in some way. If a scene doesn't do one or (ideally) more than one of these things, it needs to be cut., Read script over multiple times to ensure it's ready to be pitched. Look for typos and awkward phrasing.


Try reading the dialogue with a partner. Not only will it help you catch typos, but it will let you know if the dialogue sounds awkward.

, The best option is a professional proofreader, but if you can't afford a person like that, have friends and family read it over for structural problems, typos, and grammatical errors.

, One way to create anticipation is to end a scene before you'd normally think it's finished. A classic example is when the bomb is ticking down, and the television show cuts to commercial. Everyone is still glued to the television because he or she wants to know what happens."

Look for something that is a little baggy and frumpy to exaggerate the look of a woman from a different age group and era.;
, You can also choose some large clip on earrings.

, The contrast with your dress will add to a more exaggerated look.

, They should look intended for comfort, with thick soles.

, These gray, curly wigs are available in most costume shops and online.


Alternatively, you can also curl your hair and pin it up. Once it is set with hair spray, you can cover your hair with baby powder or flour to make it look gray.

, Follow any lines near the edge of your eyes, mouth and nose that wrinkle when you smile to get an idea of where your wrinkles would naturally be. Cover your face with liquid foundation and gently blend the wrinkles in until they look more natural.

, Cat eyeglasses or glasses with very large frames are preferable. If possible, attach a chain to the glasses.

, You can carry a clutch, add a cane or walker or a small hat to make your costume seem more authentic.

, This can help to guide your pirate costume crafting, but it's certainly not essential. It's likely to be useful where there is something unusual or fascinating about the costume of a particular pirate that you'd like to emulate.

, For pirate crew, your top doesn't need to be as fancy as that which would be worn by the pirate captain or long-term senior pirate crew. A t-shirt will serve adequately. A larger shirt is best to give the idea of rugged sloppiness, which all good pirates attempt to get across.

, You've been at sea for months. Though you don't want to pretend you have scurvy, make it seem you're a little worse for the wear. Cut areas of the t-shirt to give an impression of ruggedness:


Cut off the ends of the sleeves in a jagged fashion.
Cut the bottom of the t-shirt off. Pirates don't need hems.
Cut off the neckline of the t-shirt. $10 says Hanes was not around in the era of your pirate.

, Also paint lines around the sleeves. These don't need to be perfect––the more homemade they look, the better.


Allow the paint to dry, then flip the t-shirt over and paint the back the same way.

, If you'd rather wear a shirt than a t-shirt, that's fine too, especially if you're trying to be a pirate captain. A big, billowy white shirt is ideal. Try to locate one which has flowing sleeves rather than tight ones.


For women, choose a man's shirt as it will be bigger and more likely to billow. For men, avoid anything that's too tight or too short.

, Pirates don't wear stiff business collars. Away with it (give it the plank!) by snipping it off and restoring a ruffle or similar soft collar instead. If you hate sewing, you can probably get away with using fabric glue to attach a ruffle but ensure that the area that has been cut won't fray.


If possible, just try tucking in your ruffle to your neckline. The volume of the ruffle will cover up any self-improvements you've made to your shirt.

, Since you're wearing a decent shirt, it's more about upgrading than turning it to tatters. Consider some of the following embellishments:


Fancy buttons for both the middle and cuffs
A golden or silver chain toggle for the collar area
Ruffles! Ay, matey. Ruffles can be added almost anywhere on the shirt ––around the cuffs, around the collar, down the button line, etc.

, Let the rest of the costume do the talking. In days of yore, no pirate was donning floral-printed pants, so don't worry about your pants making a statement.


If preferred, you can wear a long skirt with petticoats underneath. It's best if it billows out, to allow freedom of movement. This is something female pirates might like to wear in place of trousers.

, You could paint stripes on a plain pair of pants to give them more of a pirate vibe. Use fabric paint to paint on vertical stripes. The color can be matched to the pants or any other part of your pirate outfit. Perhaps you're part of a pirate gang?


Another alternative is to wear pants but to wear a coat tailored to hug around the front with tails in the back like a full skirt. This would probably be something you need to sew yourself or have tailored, but it can be a nice combination of pants and dress.

, Keep it plain and dark in color; if it fits the vibe of your pirate, leave it unbuttoned so that your shirt or t-shirt can be seen underneath. Classier pirates may want to be proper and stay buttoned-up.


For a colder night, wear a very long, free flowing overcoat. It can have seen better days, provided it's not a tight fit. Search in thrift stores for such a coat. Again, it's best kept a darker color but can be colorful or patterned if you're a flamboyant pirate.

, Use this measurement to get the size of the pirate hat accurate. This is the part that tends to make the pirate costume. Fortunately, it's very easy to make a pirate's hat.

, Use this as the template. If you're not confident in this, one can be found online.


Place the template over lightweight card and trace around it. Do this twice, as you need two sides to the hat. Cut out the hat shape.

, Run glue or tape around the edges of the hat, leaving the base of the hat where your head goes in untouched. Let dry if using glue.

, Go over with at least two coats and let dry. Then paint on the skull and crossbones design in white. Again, if you're not super artsy, print this off the internet and glue on.


If you're using paint, this may take two coats; white over black at first is gray. Be patient -- your hat is one of the flashiest parts of your outfit -- put the time in to make it right.

, Tape this together in a loop or circle. Slide this inside the hat and tape or glue to the hat. This will help to keep the hat shape open and keep it snugly on your head.


If it's really windy out and you're forced to become an outdoor pirate, add elastic to keep the hat in place. Only do this as a last option though, as it can look a bit bulky and silly.

, A bright red bandana around the neck will stand out and is something a pirate might well have worn. If you don't have one, make one!


Cut a piece of red fabric in a large square shape.
Fold the square into a triangle.
Wrap around your neck. Tie the ends at the back of your neck and have the bandana tips pointed downward at the front of your neck.

, A belt around your shirt or t-shirt is a perfect pirate touch. You can either wear a very wide belt you've found in your own wardrobe or from the thrift store, or you can make a belt from fabric or card.


Some pirates wore (or ""wear"" in the images on Google) a belt that more resembles a sash. If you have a black or red scarf, it can easily be turned into a pirate belt.

, Eye patches can be purchased from costume stores or online, or you can make your own:


Draw the shape of an eye patch on a piece of lightweight card.
Cut out the patch.
Paint the outer side black. Let dry.
Pierce two holes into the top of the patch on either side of it. Thread in the ends of thin elastic and knot in place. Check that the length of elastic is just right for going around your head before cutting and knotting the final hole.

, Holes are perfectly fine provided you're not jumping puddles or snow. Add a buckle to improve the look of an old pair of boots, especially if you're a pirate captain


The more worn, the better. Hit up your local thrift shops for shoes you will probably never wear again -- or at least not until next year.

,, Just mascara and eyeshadow is good. If you're an evil pirate, this goes double. Shade your creases to give the look of added depth.


You don't necessarily have to mirror Jack Sparrow, but his is certainly a good look.

, Wear a pair of big golden circle earrings if you are a woman; if you're male, one is good. Ear(s) not pierced? A lot of costume jewelry just snaps right on.

, Fashion it like a headband -- a true pirate wears it like a sweatband. But yours can be much more fashionable and a little Bohemian.

, Cut a cutlass or sword from cardboard. Paint the blade end silver and the handle end brown. You can slip this into your belt when not carrying it.


Plastic ones are pretty cheap and abundant in costume or party shops, too. Your entertainment will be provided all night -- just be careful not to knock too many things over or poke someone in the eye.

, Use a tube from kitchen wrap or similar. Paint it black. Then attach a silver band about a quarter of a way from the top, to section it. Add another silver band to one end, which looks like the end the pirate looks through. You can attach this to your belt with a piece of elastic.

, Also paint the upper eyelid. Make sure the top and bottom connect. Do this for both eyes., Carefully use a small brush or the corner of a makeup sponge to draw a point that goes down only about an inch (2.5cm).

Floral tape
Floral wire
Flowers
Ribbon
Sturdy scissors (or shears), Take the end of your ribbon and wrap it around your head. Hold the ribbon where it crosses itself at the back of your head. Use your scissors to cut the ribbon at this point. Then measure and cut a piece of floral wire that is about as long as the distance between your temples.


With projects like this, it's always best to measure a little longer than necessary. You can always trim off excess, but adding new ribbon can make the appearance of your crown less pleasing., Line up the ends of your ribbon and wire. One end of your ribbon should extend well beyond your wire. Then use a simple knot to tightly secure the aligned ends of your wire and ribbon together.

, Use your scissors to cut each flower you intend to add to your crown so that each has about 3"" to 4"" (7.6 to 10.2 cm) of stem remaining. You may want to cut your stems on the long side.

",How to Make a Fox Mask," You can also paint some white cardstock using red, brown, or orange paint. This will give you a streaked, fur-like texture.


If you can't find cardstock, you can also use construction paper. Cardstock will simply give you more support.
If you already have a mask at home that fits you, you can trace it onto the cardstock, cut it out, then skip to the next section.;
, Place the paper widthwise across your face, from temple to temple. Gently feel where your eyes are through the paper. Lightly mark the spots on the paper with a pen or pencil, then lift the paper away.

, Set the paper down on a flat surface. Draw two almond shapes where your made the eye marks. Next, draw a basic mask shape around the eyes. The mask will cover the forehead, eyes, and part of the nose bridge. It should look a little like a peanut or jellybean.


You can look up a template online, use an existing mask, or freehand it.

, Start with the outside shape first. Next, poke a hole in each eye, then cut the eyes out. If you want the mask to be more symmetrical, fold the paper in half first, then cut along one of the lines that you drew. When you unfold the mask, it will be symmetrical ., Cut a piece of thin elastic. Tie a knot in each end. Staple each end of the elastic to each side of the mask. Make sure that the knot is inside the mask so that it holds. If you can't find thin elastic, do the following:


Punch a hole and each side of the mask.
Cut two long pieces of ribbon.
Tie a ribbon to each hole.
Use the ribbons to tie the mask on the back of your head.

, Use the same type of paper as you did for the mask body. You will be cutting both ears out at the same time.


If you decide to use painted paper, make sure that you paint both sides.

, Rotate the paper so that the folded edge is on the side. Cut out a large triangle that is almost the same height and width as the paper. This will give you some extra-large ears.


You can cut smaller ears if you prefer.

, Hold the ears together and cut them at the same time. Separate the ears when you are done. Your ears will have two flaps at the bottom., Take your first ear. Pull the left flap over the right flap until the ear curves. Secure the flaps with a glue stick.Repeat this step for the other ear.

, Take your first ear. Coat the overlapped flaps with glue. Slide the ear behind the top corner of the mask. Run your finger across the mask to seal the mask against the flaps.The ear will sort of flop forward.


Repeat this step with the other ear.

, Take a look at you mask. If the flaps are covering part of the eye hole, trim them away with a pair of scissors., Hold the paper widthwise, then roll it into a narrow cone. You want the tip to be about ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) wide. You want the base to be a few inches/centimeters across. Secure the cone with tape or glue.


The paper needs to be the same type that you used for your ears and mask body.

, Flatten the cone so that it has two folded edges. Open the cone up and flatten it the other way. When you open the cone up again, the openings at the base and tip should be shaped like squares., Cut a 2 to 3-inch (5.08 to 7.63-centimeter) slit into each folded edge. Only do this on the wider end of the cone, not the narrower one. You will be turning these into flaps so that you can attach the muzzle., Fold all flaps down towards the outside of the cone. Use the slits you cut as a guide. Choose a side to be the underside of the muzzle, then cut that flap off.

, Position the muzzle so that bridge of the nose is just below the eyes. Once you are happy with the position, secure the flaps with glue. Part of the muzzle will be hanging below the mask body.

, If there are any flaps covering the eyes, be sure to cut those away too.

, This is not absolutely necessary, but it can give your mask a nice touch. Tear short strips of red, brown, or orange paper. They need to be about ¼ to ½ inch (064 to 1.27 centimeters) wide and about 1 inch long. Curl them around a pen or pencil, then glue them around the edges of the mask.You can use just one row, or add more rows until you reach the eyes.

, Cut two circles out of tissue paper. Fold them in half, and cut a short fringe into the curved edge. Glue each folded circle to the bottom of each ear. Use a dab of glue to keep the circles flat.If you don't have white tissue paper, a plain tissue or coffee filter will also work.
Alternatively, you can paint the inside of the ears white instead.
Consider adding some black to the tips of the ears. You can do this by lightly shading them in with crayon, pencil, or paint.

, There are a few ways you can do this. The simplest way would be to paint the area around the eyes using white paint. You can also tear more short, thin trips out of white paper, then glue them around the eyes for a feathery look.You can use regular white paper or tissue paper for this.
Consider outlining the eye holes with black marker to make them more expressive.

, Use white acrylic paint and a paintbrush to apply some paint to the sides and underside of the muzzle. Extend the paint up the angled side flaps.

, Run some hot glue around the inside edge of the narrow opening at the top of your cone. Quickly press a small, black pompom into the opening.


Match the pompom to the opening size. If the opening is around ½ inch (1.27 centimeters), then use a ½ inch (1.27 centimeter) pompom.
Alternatively, you can cover the opening with two strips of masking tape, then color the tape black with a permanent marker or acrylic paint.,"

Consider adding a few more feathers to the duck cap.,
Put on the duck or duckling body.,
Add orange leggings.,
Put on shoes, then duck-feet socks.,
Top it off with the duck cap.,
Admire your work.",How to Make a Duck Costume," Use a white cap if you want to make an adult duck costume and a yellow cap if you want to make a duckling costume.;
, Lay the visor of the cap flat on top of a piece of orange craft felt. Draw around the visor, leaving a 1 inch (2.5 cm) margin between the edge of the visor and the pencil mark.Repeat this step once so that you have two visor-shaped pieces of orange felt.
Note that the visor and the pieces of felt will be used to make the beak of the duck costume.

, Cut out both beak pieces of orange felt. Use a glue stick or hot glue gun to adhere the felt to the visor of the cap. One piece should go on top, and the other piece should go on the bottom.


The overlap should slightly hang over the front of the visor. If desired, glue the excess felt overlap of the bottom and top pieces together after securing them onto the visor itself.

, Use black felt. Each circle should be 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) in diameter.


Position the two circles at the center top of the beak. They should be placed near the crown portion of the cap, but still on the beak or visor portion.
The circles should be placed about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) to 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart from one another, with the middle point between the two circles being the center top of the beak.

, Place each pom-pom on the crown portion of the cap. Each one should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) to the outer side of either nostril and 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) up and away from the visor.

, Cut out two more 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) circles of black felt. Use hot glue to attach these circles to the center front of your two white pom-poms.


This step finishes your duck cap. Set the cap aside as you work on the rest of your costume.

, Find the shoes that you intend to wear with your duck costume. Place each shoe on top of another sheet of orange felt and trace around it in pencil, leaving a 1 inch (2.5 cm) margin between the side of the shoe and the pencil mark.


Note that you need to do this with each sneaker so that you will have a foot traced out for both feet.
For best results, use a thin shoe for this. You will need to fit a sock on top of this shoe, and doing so might be difficult if you have bulky shoes on.
Alternatively, you can skip this procedure altogether and take a shortcut. Instead of making specific duck feet, wear orange rain boots with your costume.

, Sketch out three triangular points at the top of each foot design. These points should look like the webbed toes of a duck.

, Use sharp scissors to cut around the outline of each duck foot.


Note that you may still see pencil marks on the felt feet after you cut them out. If so, simply designate the marked side of the felt as the bottom side of the foot.

, Carefully and evenly fold each duck foot in half lengthwise. Make three cuts into the fold toward the back of the foot: one perpendicular to the fold, one diagonal and to the right of your first cut, and one diagonal and to the left of your first cut.


When you unfold the feet, you should notice an asterisk shape on the duck's foot.
Each cut should be about half the width of the widest part of your foot or ankle. You need the opening of each duck foot to fit over your real foot, but you do not want the cut to be so large that it slips off your foot or wrecks the felt.

, Stick one side of a Velcro strip to the bottom of the duck foot, somewhere near the middle. Apply the corresponding strip of Velcro to an orange sock you plan on wearing with the costume, positioning it where the other piece of Velcro will fall out.


When choosing socks for your costume, look for socks that are a size larger than usual or otherwise a little loose. These socks will need to be able to fit over your shoes.
This step completes your duck feet. Set them aside as you work on the rest of your costume.

, Bunch up the poly-fil until you can gather a thick cylinder's worth that is about as wide as your waist (or the waist of the intended wearer).


The polyfill is not strictly necessary, but adding it will produce a plumper, more rounded duck costume, so it is strongly recommended.

, Turn a white sweatshirt inside out and place the cylinder of polyfill along the inside back of the shirt. Tape the stuffing in place with masking tape.


Note that the white sweatshirt you use should be long enough to cover your rear. The stuffing will be added to the stretch of sweatshirt between the bottom of the shirt and the waistline of your pants.
You might find it helpful to try the sweatshirt on after you add the filling to see how it looks. Remove or add more filling as necessary to get a smooth yet plump look you can deal with.

, Trace three skinny almond shapes onto white felt, each one measuring roughly 12 inches (30.5 cm) long and 3 inches (7.6 cm) wide at the thickest point.


Tape or glue the top 3 inches (7.6 cm) of each tail feather to the inside of the center back of your sweatshirt. Each feather should connect at the same point on the sweatshirt yet fan out in different directions from underneath the sweatshirt bottom.

, You will need a separate rectangle of 21 by 8 inch (53.3 by 20.3 cm) white felt for each wing.


To make a wing:

Fold the rectangle in half, shortening it from 21 inches (53.3 cm) to 10.5 inches (26.7 cm).
Trace a simple three or four feathered wing shape onto the felt. The ends of the feathers should point away from the folded part of the felt.
Cut the shape out. Leave the folded edge uncut.
Glue or tape the tips of the wings together, but leave enough room on the inside of the wing, near the fold, to slip the sweatshirt sleeve through.


Repeat for the second wing.

, Slip the sweatshirt on temporarily. Slide the wings through your sweatshirt arms so that the feathers point down when you hold your arms out. Tape or glue in place.

, Place the boa over one arm and cut off enough to extend from the shoulder to the tip of the sleeve. Place the rest of the boa over the other arm and repeat, giving yourself another arm's length of feathers.


Use a hot glue gun or a needle and thread to attach the feather boa strips to each arm of the sweatshirt. Make sure that the feathers will be positioned on the top of the sleeves, rather than on the bottom or along the sides.

, Cut off the appropriate length with sharp scissors.


As with the sleeves, use hot glue or a needle and thread to attach these feathers to the front of the sweatshirt chest.

, If you still have feathers left from the boa, you can glue up to 5 inches (12.7 cm) of boa to the top crown of your duck cap.

, Slip the sweatshirt on, being careful to avoid knocking off any of the felt or feathers.


If the sweatshirt feels uncomfortable, you could wear a separate shirt beneath it. Make sure that the under-shirt cannot be seen once you put the sweatshirt on. If it can be seen, choose a shirt that matches the color of your costume's body: white for the adult duck, yellow for the duckling.

, Most duck and duckling legs are orange, so to mimic the appearance of duck legs, you will need to wear orange leggings.


If you are uncomfortable with actual leggings, use orange sweatpants or orange yoga pants. You could also use orange dye to color an old pair of white jeans or other lightly colored structured pants.

, Slip your shoes on. Place your orange Velcro socks over the shoes, and slide the orange duck feet over the socks and above your foot. Fix the duck feet in place by pressing the Velcro squares onto the Velcro of your socks.

, Place the duck cap on your head. Adjust as necessary to make it feel comfortable.

, Take a look in the mirror and straighten out any aspect of the costume that seems off-balance. Once you finish, your duck costume is complete and ready to show off.

Paint the head.,
Make the teeth.,
Create the eyes.",How to Make a Crocodile Costume1," To create a nice crocodile head you’ll need a long-sized cardboard box. Make sure it is large enough to fit the future crocodile’s head. You'll also need:


Glue or staples.
Craft knife and/or scissors.
Strong tape suitable for cardboard.
Buttons or other knick-knacks suitable for eyes.;
, Place the box on its base. Tape the box together so that all the openings are secured. Cut out a triangle and leave the base edge attached to the box. Position this cut near the edge of the box and be sure that it is large enough to fit a head. This will form a flap that covers the back of the subject's head.

, Staple a piece of strong and wide clothing elastic to this flap. This should be ample length to go around the back of the subject’s head. It will keep the crocodile head strapped to the subject’s head. Make sure to staple several times for extra strength., Down the two long side edges of the cardboard box, cut out two ""mouth lines."" You could cut a wavy or a straight mouth. Have an idea of the crocodile’s mouth before cutting. You may even want to outline the lines to cut with pencil to create an even cut.


Start the mouth about a quarter away from the end where the subject’s head will go.
When you reach the other end of the box, continue cutting the mouth's shape. You want the mouth to open like a gaping crocodile!
Leave the ""lips"" and ""jaws"" intact., To make the crocodile mask more authentic, paint it green or a tan brown. Paint the base before adding teeth and eyes. The classic crocodile look is green like the crocodile who ate Captain Hook's’ hand in Peter Pan.

, You could cut simple jagged tooth shapes from paper or foam. Hunt around for old pieces of white foam that come from recent electronics purchase. Cut material into the shape of teeth. Glue or staple the teeth firmly at even intervals along the mouth shape.


Another great alternative is to use up the foam peanuts that surround goods in packages., The eyes should sit directly above the beginning of the mouth at the top of the mask. Draw on eyes with a thick, dark colored marker. You could also use anything lying around in your craft or sewing basket. Big round yellow buttons are good to draw a crocodile eye slit in with a Sharpie marker. Stick the buttons on firmly with glue."

Assemble the costume.",How to Make a Chick Costume1," Heat up a hot glue gun and draw a line of hot glue onto the bottom of a baby onesie that fits your child. Immediately begin attaching feathers to this line of glue, adhering the feathers at their base so that the tops of the feathers face downward.


Draw the line of glue roughly 2 inches (5 cm) from the bottom of the onesie.
Attach the feathers so that they are side-by-side, if not overlapping. The feathers should fan out so that some point straight down and others point down and slanted to either side.
Make sure that the onesie you use is one that you do not plan to use for other purposes in the future. Once the feathers are glued on, they will stay on for good.
The onesie can be in any color, but if you choose a yellow onesie, any gaps left in between the feathers will be less noticeable.;
, Attach more feathers to the front of the onesie in the same manner used to attach the bottom feathers. Only draw one to three lines of glue at a time to prevent it from cooling off as you attach the feathers.


Make sure that the feathers mostly point downward by do so at varying angles. If the feathers all lie in the same exact direction, the final result will look too flat.

, Take a step back and look over the front of your onesie. If any areas look too flat or if any sections appear empty, fix it by gluing more feathers into the space.


For an area that looks flat, glue extra feathers into the section beneath the current row of feathers. Make this secondary row of feathers point upward instead of down so that the patch ends up looking fluffier.

, Turn the onesie over so that the back faces you. Glue feathers onto the back of the onesie using the same method you used for the front.


Start with a single line of glue at the bottom of the onesie, position roughly 2 inches (5 cm) from the bottom hem.
Gradually work your way up, gluing feathers to the rest of the onesie back one small section at a time.
Fill in any empty spaces or flat areas with more feathers.

, Standard craft feathers are too long for use with the sleeves. Before you cover the sleeves, you need to snip the rest of your feathers in half using sharp scissors.


Note that any excess half feathers that remain after you coat the sleeves can be used to fill in additional gaps or flat areas of the costume.

, As with the body of the onesie, you should work from the bottom up. Start at the edge of the sleeve and work your way to the shoulder.


Glue feathers onto the front and back of each sleeve. Work in small sections.
Fill in any gaps or flat areas with additional half-feathers as needed.

, Use sharp scissors to cut a foam drink cozy in half lengthwise or vertically. Even the bottom of the cozy should be cut in half.


You will be left with two identical halves, each with a half-circle bottom.

, Use hot glue to attach the half-circle bottom of the cozy to the front of a snug baby cap. Trim the front of the orange cozy half so that it resembles a half-moon beak shape.

, Apply more yellow half-feathers to the hat, working from the bottom up. Attach two large craft eyes on either side of the orange foam beak.


Work around the entire crown of the cap, filling any empty spaces in with additional feathers as needed.

, The individual pieces of your costume are now complete, so all you need to do is put the whole thing together. Slip on some yellow leggings before putting the feathered onesie on your baby. Cover the feet with orange socks and place the feathered-and-beaked cap on your baby's head, with the beak at the front.

Use a headband.,
Use a hood.,
Use a baseball cap.,
Make flipper bracelets.,
Use gloves instead.,
Try arm warmers or sleeves.,
Use regular clothes.,
Use a pajama onesie.,
Wear a dress.,
Paint the green base.,
Add the white chin.,
Paint on the eyes.",How to Make a Frog Costume," You can make a headband with frog eyes, in order to get that froggy look. Get some styrofoam balls and paint them with thick white paint (this will make them look less like styrofoam). Then paint black pupils in. Then cover the whole thing in a shiny glaze, like Modge Podge. Next, get a green headband and the use hot glue to attach the eyeballs.


If you have trouble getting the eyes to stay on the headband or if you don't like the super cartoony look, you can make them look more realistic by cutting off the bottom 1/5th of the ball and making a flat surface to glue down.;
, Another method is to put the eyes on top of a green hood, such as a hood on a hoodie sweatshirt. Make the eyes as directed above. Then get some green felt. Cut an oval which is wider than the ball and almost twice as long. Make four of these ovals, and then cut the ends off of two of them to create eyelids. Glue the eyeballs onto the oval and then glue the eyes on top. The whole eye structure can be hand sewn onto a hood.

, You can also use a baseball cap or other hat. Straight gluing like what's listed in step 1 or the eyelids method listed in step 2 would both work. Do whichever you prefer! The flattened eyeball does work better in this instance though, so have a knife on hand to cut the styrofoam.

, Frogs have little webbed hands, which you might want to recreate for your costume. An easy way to do this is to trace the shape of the hands onto felt with an extra horizontal strip of felt attached at the wrist. Cut this shape out and then use velcro on the ends of the strip to create bracelets! This can be used to make hand and foot covers for your costume.

, Another option is to use regular knit gloves. Get green gloves and then cut triangles of felt to fit between the fingers. Put on plastic gloves, then put on the knit gloves. Next, glue the felt into place on the knit glove and let it dry. The plastic gloves will help keep the glue from getting on your fingers or from sealing the finger holes closed by leaking through.

, This method is similar to the first method. Simply draw and cut out some froggy hands on felt and then glue or sew them on the underside of some green arm warmers or the sleeve of a sweater, just past the hem. This makes them easier to get out of the way if you need your hands.

, Get some tight fitting green clothes, such as skinny jeans or leggings and a tee shirt. You can leave these in the green color they are, or you can use spray paint to get a realistic texture to the ""skin"". Spray on a white belly, a darker color and the back, and maybe even some spots!

, A pajama suit or footed pajamas in a green color make a great frog costume. Don't feel like this is only for kids though: you can easily find adult pajamas in this style online and in some stores. You can do the same painting process if you want to, but it is not recommended if you want to wear the pajamas again.

, For a Princess-and-the-Frog, girly look, try wearing a dress instead. Get a green dress or make a green ballet tutu to get that Bayou Princess look at home with no sewing involved. Don't forget some princess accessories, like a crown!

, Get some green face paint and apply it all over the face using a makeup sponge. You'll want to be sure to keep hair out of the way!

, Next take some white face paint and sponge it onto the lips, chin and neck. Try to create a soft fade to the green on either side.

, Then, in black eyeliner draw a circle which completely circles the eye socket (up to the eyebrow and going down onto the cheek). Fill in the circle with red or orange paint and then use the eyeliner again to make the pupil. The person's eye should be close while this paint is applied, so that when the eye is close it looks like a frog is looking at you!

Find a hat.,
Attach felt.,
Add the teeth.,
Create the eyes and other details.",How to Make a Crocodile Costume2," Go to a local discount clothing store and look through their hat selection. Find a simple green baseball cap. You could even pick one up at a thrift store and use it after a thorough wash., You’ll need quite a bit of green felt. Cut and drape the felt around the hat. You can attach the felt by using a hot glue gun. This will act as the base for the crocodile head.


If you’re going for a brown crocodile, use brown felt.
Don’t leave any gaps or open spaces on the hat., You could cut jagged tooth shapes from paper or use foam. Hunt around for old pieces of white foam that come from recent electronics purchase. Cut material into the shape of teeth. Use a hot glue gun to attach the teeth around the brim of the cap., Along with making crocodile eyes, you can also create spikes on the back the cap for extra detail. Cut a piece of white felt into two circles or semicircles. The semicircles are good for creating a aggravated or scarier crocodile. Color in the pupils using a black or yellow marker.


For the spikes you can fashion small felt funnels. Use different colors like light green and tan. Attach them to the back of the hat using a hot glue gun."
"
Plan out the body.,
Make the body.,
Make a tail.,
Add claws.",How to Make a Crocodile Costume3," You could use your sewing skills or dress the part instead. You might even be able to find a green bodysuit where you can add little details. Another way you could dress the part is by wearing the same color for the top and bottom., If you are sewing savvy, sew together a green jumpsuit. Add felt back scales cut into large triangular shapes down the back of the jumpsuit. The felt can be in green but using a contrasting yellow is far more effective.


If you're not sewing savvy, just dress in green. Add paper scales by tape or glue onto a green ribbon and pin it to the back of the collar to flow down the back of the body., For the tail you can essentially use anything you like. Tape together two to three cardboard rolls. Paint them green or wrap green crepe paper around the long roll and stick it to the roll at each end with tape. Attach the tail to the pant’s rear with several safety pins or use velcro. The latter option is safer just in case the crocodile sits on a pin accidentally. If you sewed a costume, glue a piece of ribbon onto the tail and sew the ribbon end onto the costume you have already made.


Get an old stocking and stuff with newspaper. Paint green or wrap with green crepe paper. Attach in the same way.
Sew a tail. Use old scraps of green colored fabric and sew a long tail shape. Make sure to leave it hollow, so that it can be stuffed with newspaper, scrap pieces of fabric or rolled up pantyhose. Finish sewing the end up and attach to the costume with stitches., Don't forget to add claws to the shoes. Make the claws from foam and paint them brown. You could also make claws from spare pieces of the cardboard used to make the crocodile mask. Cut the material into claw shapes. To attach the claws to the shoes:


Make a felt ""wrap-over."" Cut a piece of felt into the shape of your shoe, so it covers the top half of each of the shoes to be worn. Sew or staple two pieces of elastic on the underside of the felt; each piece must be long enough to go around the base of the shoe. Attach one piece of elastic at the ankle end of the foot and one piece of elastic near the toe end of the foot. Attach the claws with glue to the felt and slip the whole piece over the shoes."

Take the necessary measurements.,
Cut a strip of cardboard.,
Cut a rectangle from white felt.,
Form a loop with the cardboard.,
Attach the felt.,
Trim the top of the felt.,
Strengthen the lower eggshell.,
Create a rounded bottom edge.,
Cut ties out of yellow ribbon.,
Create the top of the eggshell.,
Assemble the costume.",How to Make a Chick Costume2," You will need a waist measurement and a torso measurement. Both should be obtained using a tape measure.


Measure your child's waist by wrapping the tape measure around his or her stomach so that it crosses over the belly button and stays parallel to the floor. Double the number, then subtract 1 inch (2.5 cm) from that measurement.
For the torso measurement, measure the length between the child's crotch and his her or mid-chest. Add 2 inches (5 cm) to this measurement.

, Use sharp scissors to cut a strip of flexible cardboard the same length as the measurement derived from your child's waist. The strip of cardboard should also be 3 inches (7.6 cm) wide.


The cardboard should be sturdy enough to stand upright when held from the bottom but flexible enough to bend without creasing.

, The width of the rectangle should match the measurement derived from your child's torso. The length of the rectangle should match the measurement derived from your child's waist.


Note that the length must also match the length of your cardboard.

, Gently fold the cardboard strip into a loop without creasing it. Hot glue the ends together, reducing the total circumference by no more than 1 inch (2.5 cm).


In other words, overlap the ends by 1 inch (2.5 cm), at most. An even thinner section of overlapping cardboard would be even better.

, Wrap the felt rectangle around the outside of the cardboard loop. Leave 2 inches (5 cm) sticking up from the top and glue in place.

, Use sharp scissors to cut a jagged pattern of alternating triangles into the 2 inches (5 cm) of felt sticking out from the top of the cardboard.


Note that this jagged pattern should look resemble the cracks that form when a chick pokes its way out of its shell.

, Line the cardboard loop and the felt with a layer of cotton sheet batting help the structure maintain its shape. Glue the batting in place with a hot glue gun.


Cover all of the cardboard and felt with the batting. Use sharp scissors to trim the batting to the jagged shell pattern at the top of the felt before gluing it down.

, Fold over a portion of felt along the bottom edge so that it overlaps by 1 inch (2.5 cm), creating a dart in the fabric. Glue in place. Repeat three more times, making a total of four equally spaced 1 inch (2.5 cm) darts.


This step should round out the bottom edge while making it easy for your child to still move around with the eggshell half on.

, Cut four lengths of sturdy yellow ribbon, each measuring 18 inches (46 cm). Glue two of the ribbons to the front inside of the hoop and the other two to the back inside of the hoop.


Make sure that the front and back ribbons line up evenly. You will used these ribbons as ties to hold the eggshell half on your child.

, Cover a white sun hat with white cotton sheet batting. Cover the batting with additional white felt, and cut the bottom of the felt into a jagged pattern similar to the one made on the bottom half of the shell.


When cutting out felt for the hat, cut out six rounded triangular pieces of felt measuring 9 inches (23 cm) long by 5 inches (13 cm) wide, with 1 inch (2.5 cm) flat corners.
Glue the felt onto the batting by lining all the tips at the center top of the crown. Bring each piece down and over the sides of the hat, allowing 2 inches (5 cm) or so of overhang at the bottom of the hat.
From the overhang at the bottom, make your jagged shell pattern.

, Put your child in a yellow t-shirt and yellow pants. Slip on some orange socks for tiny chick feet, then dress your baby in the two egg halves.


Since the top egg half is made from a hat, simply place the hat on your child's head to put this portion of the costume on.
Slide the bottom egg half onto your child from the bottom. Tie the left hand front and back ribbons together over the child's left shoulder. Tie the right hand front and back ribbons together over the child's right shoulder.

Gather your materials.,
Start with a petticoat, skirt, or tutu.,
Attach the feather boas to the bottom of the skirt.,
Create a simple mask that covers the eyes.,
Adhere the feathers to the mask.,
Put together the rest of the outfit.,
Combine all the elements.",How to Make a Bird Costume1," Before you start creating your costumes, you will want to gather all of your materials. Gather:


A skirt, petticoat, or tutu that fits you. Start with a solid cother like white or blue.
Blue feathers or boas
Hot glue gun
Leggings and a tank top
Craft mask or a homemade mask;
, You will want to start with a solid color that will emphasize the blue of the feathers. You will want to pick the colors of a bluebird, such as blue or white. Avoid garish colors (green, orange, red).

, Use a hot glue gun to attach the boa, starting from bottom hem and working toward the waistband.


Apply a line of glue all the way around the bottom edge of the skirt and press the feather boa into the glue until the entire bottom edge is covered.Continue to wrap the boa upward in a loose spiral to create a feathered look.
Note that if the petticoat or tutu has a fringe at the bottom, you should glue the feather boa above this fringe. Do not overlap the fringe with the boa.
If you want a more elaborately feathered skirt, repeat this procedure with a second feather boa in a slightly different shade of blue. Glue this feather boa around the bottom of the skirt, directly above the boa at the bottom.
You can repeat this once more with a third feather boa in yet another shade of blue.
Let the glue dry before you continue.

, Take a desired material (such as blue felt or poster board) and trace a mask around your eyes, forehead, and over the bridge of your nose. Cut the shape out.


Make sure you cut holes large enough so that you can sufficiently see out of.
Thread a piece of ribbon or elastic on the sides of the mask. You will want to poke a hole using a pair of scissors or hole puncher to do this.
Or, to skip the above steps, you can purchase a simple craft mask at a craft store that you can then decorate.

, Use hot glue. Do this when the mask is not on your face. Start at the outside corner of one eye hole. Use a hot glue gun to glue the feathers so that they fan out diagonally from this corner.
Move in toward the inner corner of the same eye hole. Glue more feathers so that they fan outward to the same side, overlapping the previous layer of feathers but not the eye hole itself.
Repeat this procedure with the other side of the mask.
Trim a few feathers down to 1 inch (2.5 cm) lengths. Glue these pieces in the center of the mask, covering the overlap space between the two previously feathered halves.
Let dry.

, Now that you have the feathery parts done, you need to dress with a good foundation outfit. Try and stick with colors that will not stand out but will create a good background for your feathery accouterments.


For example, you could try wearing a leotard to bring more attention to your craftiness. Or, try and wear leggings and a tank-top.
You can wear simple black shoes, or if feeling more adventurous, try and mirror a bird's legs by wearing orange leggings/shoes.

, Everything should work together and you should look like a pretty blue bird!


The blue feathered skirt corresponds to the bluebird's blue feathered tail, and the blue mask similarly corresponds to the bluebird's blue face.
A chest of a bluebird is usually a mixture of tan and white, which is why a tan boa or white tank top may be used instead of blue ones.
A blue shrug or sweater represents the blue wings of a bluebird.

Gather your supplies.,
Cut jagged edges in the felt.,
Center the wing fabric on the shirt or dress.,
Glue or sew the fabric.,
Assemble the outfit.",How to Make a Bat Costume1," You will need a long sleeved black shirt, black pants, a long piece of black felt for the wings, and hot glue or sewing supplies. To find out how much felt you need, measure yourself from wrist to wrist with your arms stretched out. Next, measure the distance from the top of your back to your waist. Use these measurements to choose a rectangular piece of felt.


If you want to make a more feminine bat costume, use a long-sleeve dress instead of a shirt and pants.Felt can be found at most craft supply stores. If you use another kind of fabric you will have to use a sewing kit to attach the wings.;
, First, fold the felt in half lengthwise. Next, cut the bottom edge of the mask into a jagged bat wing. The jagged edge should be longer near the center fold and shorter near the edges. When unfolded, the fabric will resemble a long triangle.


If you want to go for a cute look cut the edges into a scalloped pattern instead of a jagged lightning pattern., Lay the shirt or dress out flat on your work surface. Stretch the sleeves out, making a straight line from wrist to wrist. Lay the wing fabric on the shirt with the long side of the triangle resting on the shoulders and arms. Center the fabric so that the tips of the wings reach each wrist.


Use straight pins to secure the fabric if you’re worried about the wings shifting. Straight pins can be found in most sewing supply kits.

, Apply a small circle of glue between the shoulder blades of the shirt or dress. Press the wing fabric onto the glue. Next, apply a circle of glue to each wrist and press the wingtips into them. Once the glue cools the costume is ready to wear.If you aren’t using felt for your wing fabric you must sew on the wings. Add a few stitches where you would normally use glue., Carefully put on the winged shirt, pants, and black shoes. If you used a dress, put on the dress and pair it with cute black shoes. If you made a paper mache mask, tie the mask tightly around your head.


You don’t have to wear a mask if you don’t want to. Instead, purchase black cat ears that resemble bat ears or wear face paint.

Gather your materials.,
Cut out a gray wing.,
Cut out a black wing.,
Sew the wings together.,
Attach two pieces of ribbon to the neck of the wing cape.,
Measure a gray sweatshirt.,
Secure the feathers to the sweatshirt.,
Make an owl mask.,
Put it all together.",How to Make a Bird Costume2," Before you get started, you will want to gather enough materials to successfully complete the outfit. Acquire:


Brown, gray, and black fabric - enough to stretch from the finger on one hand to another. You want it wide enough to make a cape to attach feathers
Additional fabric to create enough feathers to attach to your wings
A circle template to make large enough hole for your head. A standard dinner plate is a good size
Hot glue
Ribbon or elastic
Sewing machine or needle and thread
A plain gray sweatshirt you do not mind cutting/gluing things to (cheap ones can be found in consignment shops or craft stores)
Gray sweatpants
A craft mask or a homemade cut-out mask from craft board, foam, or fabric

, Cut out a length of gray felt that is as wide as your arm span and as long as the distance between your neck and the back of your knees. From this, cut out a basic wing shape.Position a dinner plate face-down over the center top of the fabric. Trace around half the edge using chalk, then cut this portion out. This dip will be positioned around your neck when you wear the wing cape.
Place a straight edge at the corner of your neckline. Run it downward diagonally at a 20 degree angle (approximately) until you reach the edge of the cape. Trace this line and repeat on the other side. Cut along the two lines. This will be the top of your cape.
Create a zig-zag line all around the bottom of the cape. Sketch out a half circle extending from one end of your wing to the other. Draw alternating triangles and inverse triangles around this curve until you reach the other side. Cut along this line.
This completes the top wing of your wing cape.

, Place your first wing on top of a larger piece of black felt. Trace along the neckline and top edge of the wing using chalk, but extend the edge past that of your gray wing by the length of your triangular zig-zags. Cut along these lines, then make your zig-zag pattern on the bottom edge of the black wing.


When you make the zig-zag pattern for this wing, the triangles and inverted triangles should alternate in opposite order. In other words, when you line up the two wings, you should see a black triangle in the gap left by every inverted gray triangle., Line the two pieces up so that the neckline and top edges lie evenly with each other. Sew a straight stitch across the neckline only.


You can either use a sewing machine or sew the pieces together by hand.

, Measure out two lengths of black ribbon. Sew one end of each piece to either corner of the neckline, on the side of the black wing.


Each length of ribbon should be long enough to wrap around your neck once.
Instead of sewing, you could attach the ribbon using a hot glue gun.
This step completes your wing cape.

, Measure the distance from the sleeves to the bottom of the shirt. Also measure the width of the front. You will need to cut enough feathers from desired fabrics to completely cover this patch of material.Cut out a patch of almond-shaped material for each feather. Each feather should be about 3 inches (7.6 cm) long and 2 inches (5 cm) wide.
Divide the width of the shirt by 2 inches (5 cm). This number is the number of feathers you will need per row.
Multiply the row count by three for your total number of black feathers.
Multiply the row count by two for your total number of gray feathers.

, Apply each feather to the sweatshirt with a dab of hot glue. You will alternate back and forth between black rows and gray rows, and should start and end with black rows.


Start with the bottom row. The bottom of each feather should just barely extend below the bottom hem of the shirt.
Gradually work your way up, row by row. The feathers of each row should slightly overlap those of the row below it.
Line up each feather so that they lie side by side within each row.

, Sketch out the shape of a mask or trace a pre-made pattern onto soft black craft foam. Cut around the outline of this shape and cut out two holes for eyes. Glue the mask onto a pair of cheap sunglasses.If you do not feel comfortable freehand sketching the mask there are free patterns on many craft sites you can print.After cutting out the mask and the eye holes, cut out two rings made with gray craft foam. The inside of each ring should be large enough to fit around each eye hole. Glue these rings to outside perimeter of the eye holes.
Let everything dry after gluing the mask together.

, Put on your feathered sweatshirt and gray sweatpants. Tie on your wing cape, and finish off the outfit by slipping on your owl mask. With this, the costume is complete.

Gather your materials.,
Cut out a basic beak pattern.Sketch out two hooked beak halves onto black felt.,
Sew the beak.,
Cut out the eye pieces.,
Piece the eyes together.,
Glue a few feathers to the back of each eye.,
Adhere the eyes to the hood.,
Sew the fringe to the outside of each arm.,
Put it all together.",How to Make a Bird Costume3," To make this costume, you will need:


Sewing supplies
Black felt
Yellow felt
White felt
Black hooded sweatshirt
Hot glue
Dark pants and shoes

, Use sharp scissors to cut both pieces out.


You can freehand sketch the beak pattern, if desired. Note that you need to draw the beak from a side view, rather than a top view. The base should be somewhat rectangular, but the beak itself should appear as a hooked or curved triangular shape.
Your beak should be large enough to attach to your sweatshirt and make the hood of the black sweatshirt look like the bird’s head. The size may be dependent on if you are an adult or a kid.

, Lay the two beak pieces on top of each other and sew along the top edge. Place the beak on the top of the hood, just above the opening, and sew the base of the beak onto the hood.


Since felt doesn't fray, you do not need to turn the material inside-out as you work. Make sure that your seams are neat and even, however, to prevent the work from looking messy.
The beak should be positioned in the center of the hood and should hang over the face area when you put the hood on your head.

, For each eye, you will need a yellow circle, a black circle, and a white semi-circle.


The yellow circles should be about 3 inches in diameter.
The black circles should be about 2.5 inches in diameter.
The white semi-circle should be about 1 inch in diameter.

, Lay the black circle on top of the yellow circle, precisely centered. Glue in place. Lay the white semi-circle on top of the black circle so that the flat edge lies in the center of the black circle. Glue in place.


Use fabric glue or hot glue for this.
Let dry before pressing on.

, Cut off a few individual feathers from your strip of feathered fringe. Turn each eye over to reveal the back, and glue these feathers around about half of each eye.


Note that the feathers should fan out from the side of the eye facing the flat side of your white semi-circular portion.

, Position the eyes on either side of the beak on the hood. They should be to the sides of the beak, but above the actual beak base. Fix in place by sewing or gluing them on.


The curved side of the white semi-circles should face inward, toward the beak, and the feathers surrounding each eye should fan out to the sides.

, Cut a strip of feathered fringe, out of black felt, long enough to cover the sleeve of your arm, extending from the shoulder seam down to the cuff. Pin and sew in place.


Note that the fringe should point down and out when you put the shirt on. Keep that in mind as you pin and sew.
Repeat this process with the other sleeve so that both are covered with black feathered fringe.

, Put on some black pants and black shoes. Slip on your feathered black sweatshirt, then pull the hood over your head so that the beak and eyes show. This completes your raven costume.

Gather your supplies.,
Make some paper mache paste.,
Make the foil mold.,
Cover the mold with paper mache.,
Add five layers of paper mache.,
Paint your mask.,
Cut and trim the mask.,
Attach the mask to your head.",How to Make a Bat Costume2," You will need five or six foot-long sheets of aluminum foil, a few sheets of newspaper torn into one inch by six inch strips, acrylic paint, paintbrushes, scissors, a ribbon or large rubber band, a cup of flour, a cup of water, a mixing bowl, and a spoon.


Most bat masks use black paint for the “fur,” white paint for the eyes, and red paint for the mouth. However, feel free to get creative!
You can measure out foil from a roll or purchase individual sheets of foil from a baking supply store.

, Add a cup of flower and a cup of water to a mixing bowl. Mix it well to remove any lumps. The mixture should be the consistency of glue. If it’s too thin, add some more flour. If it’s too thick, add some water.If you don’t feel like mixing up your own glue, you can buy non-toxic clear paper mache paste at a craft supply store., Crinkle each sheet of foil slightly. Next, lay the sheets of foil on top of one another. Press the layers of foil onto your face, using your fingers to outline each major facial feature.Pay special attention to the areas around your nose, brow bones, eyes, and chin.


The more detail you press into the mold, the better the mask will fit your face.
If your mold seems flimsy, gently stuff the inside with newspaper to help it keep its shape.

, First, dip a strip of newspaper into your glue until it’s completely saturated. Gently squeeze any excess glue off the tip. Next, lay the strip of newspaper down on your mask. Repeat this step, completely covering the mask with strips of newspaper.


If you’d like to add ears to your mask, fold pieces of wet newspapers into triangles and attach them to the top of the mask. These triangles will take extra time to dry.

, Allow each layer to dry before adding another layer.Once the fifth layer has dried completely press gently on the mask to test the strength. If you think the mask is too flimsy, add another layer of paper mache and test it again.


If you add a layer of paper mache before the previous layer has dried, your mask will take twice as long to dry.

, Paint from light to dark, allowing the paint to dry between each layer. For example, if your mask will have large eyes and pointy teeth, paint the eyes and teeth first, the red mouth next, and the black fur last. Otherwise, the lighter paint will mix with the darker paint and create a mess of grays and pinks.


Acrylic paint is water-soluble. Therefore, if you only have one paintbrush, you can dip it in water in between colors to clean off the paint.Avoid using oil paints and other paint types that take a long time to dry. Otherwise you’ll be waiting a few days for your mask instead of a few hours.

, Use a sharpie or pencil to mark out the mouth and eye holes before cutting them out with scissors. If you’re not sure where to put the holes, wear the mask while you carefully mark the areas to cut. If your mask is uneven, neatly trim the edges of your mask.


Most people cut small circles on the eye area to see through and a thin slit on the mouth area to talk through.
If you have trouble cutting small areas with scissors use a hobby knife instead. These knives can be found at most craft supply stores.

, Cut two holes on the sides of the mask. Next, thread a ribbon or large rubber band through this area. Place the mask on your face and tie the ribbon or rubber band tightly. The mask should rest tightly but comfortably.


If you have long hair, use a ribbon instead of a rubber band. Rubber bands can cause damage to your hair."

Wear ghoulish face paint.,
Use props with your bat outfit.,
Add decorations to the bat wings.",How to Make a Bat Costume3," If you don’t want to wear a mask, consider wearing face paint instead. First, cover your skin in a thin layer of white paint to make you look ghoulish. Next, paint grey circles around your eyes. Use some black paint to outline “fangs” on your lips.Finish the look by painting your lips black.


Wear plastic fangs instead of painting them on for an extra creepy effect.
Add mascara and red lipstick to become a cute or sexy bat.

, Visit your local Halloween supply store or costume shop and buy some interesting bat props. For example, if you’re planning on wearing a dress with your costume, buy some spider webbed black tights. If you don’t want to make a mask but you still want to wear one, buy a scary bat mask.


Many Halloween supply stores are seasonal, opening in August and closing after Halloween., If you’re making the costume for a child, add sparkles to the edge of the bat wings with craft glue. If you want to add bold colorful designs to the bat wings, paint the fabric with colorful fabric paint.If you like to sew, consider sewing black fur to the top of the bat wings for a realistic touch.

Select the materials for your tail.,
Mark a line where you want your loop to be.,
Wrap a 5 feet (1.66 meter) piece of 16 - 20 gauge annealed wire around a rod or stick tightly securing one end to the stick and pulling from the other end.,
Once the entire wire is neatly wrapped around the stick, slowly pull and stretch the wire evenly spaced to the desired length of the tail.,
Decorate your tail with yarn.,
Make the belt loop.,
Cut a round piece of leather, plastic, cardboard, or wood slightly bigger than the diameter of your tail.,
Add a furry look, if desired.",How to Make a Cats (Musical) Inspired Costume1," Begin by using either rope or cording that extends past the back of the knees when held up to your waist. Make sure at least a three- to four-inch portion of the rope or cording is reserved. This will be used to make the loop for the belt.;
, Once this has been completed, you can start making the actual tail.

, Using your wrists tightly and firmly twist and turn the stick pulling and wrapping the wire to the stick.

Create just enough tension to keep the wire straight and neatly wrapped around the stick to turn the wire into a spring.

,

Insert the piece of rope through the center of the wire spring. This will make your tail stay erect and flexible.

,

Purchase yarn in whatever colors you like. For the best effect, the colors should match your costume.






Cut a six-inch strip of yarn, and then cut that strip in half.






Take both strips, and starting about an inch or so from the bottom, tie both strips onto the rope or cording (they should be right next to each other on the rope or cording).






Repeat these steps, but twirl the rope around as you go to ensure the yarn is distributed evenly all the way around the rope or cording. You will inevitably notice gaps in your tail.






Cut some more lengths of yarn. For these, do not tie the yarn around the rope or cording. Instead, knot the two halves of the strips of yarn and super glue them where you see gaps.







, Fold over the length of rope or cording that you had marked off, and either tape, superglue, or tie it tightly with yarn to make a loop. Make sure it's secure and won't come undone.

, This will be used as the base connection of the tail to your belt.


Drill or punch a hole wide enough to fit the end of the tail's wire through the center of your tail base. Wrap and secure the 6 inch wire end to the belt and round base.
Cut a strip of rubber cabinet liner or plastic tape around the base and the wire to cover any sharp edge of wire and add extra strength to hold the tail securely.







, Cutting and gluing or stitching strips of soft and fluffy fabric around the diameter and length of the tail can make the tail look like real cat fur.

If you use yarn, you must fray it with a fine-bristled cat grooming brush after repeating the first step of making the tail (knot the halves of pieces of yarn together, then fray)

, Twist together longer pieces of your fur material at the top. Securing the topknots with thread or little hair ties, or cover the entire tips of the ears with yarn that matches the wig. This prevents the topknots from coming undone.

, Once the ears are made, glue them onto the cap and ensure they are secure and not floppy. Once this is done, you may use hairspray or styling gel to style it however you want.

, They should consist of strips of cloth or whatever you think will work. Shape them like an isosceles triangle. Sew the sideburns onto the wig.

, This all should be done on a porcelain/foam/plastic head to ensure precision and accurate measurements.

There are many different styles of painting to use when making a cat costume, but if you don't have the time or just want to get it done and over with, paint the base color with big, bold strokes, allowing the color of the unitard to show slightly underneath depending on what colors and designs you will use.
Use only fabric paint.

, If you want to be a specific character, look up pictures of him or her to get the color idea, then incorporate their design onto your sketch design.

,, This is important if you're going for the musical-inspired Cats look. Use frayed yarn, fur, or feathers. Attach them (sew them if you used yarn or glue them if you used fake fur and feathers) to the shoulders of your costume. As always, be sure to match the design of your costume.

If you don’t already own a pair, go to a store like Walmart and H&M and buy a pair of dark green or greenish-brown leggings or tights. If you are buying nylon tights, try to purchase ones that are opaque instead of see-through.If you feel uncomfortable wearing leggings or tights, buy a pair of sweatpants or linen pants with a skinny fit. You can also wear green cut-off shorts if you don’t want to wear long pants.;
, If you don’t already own one, buy a large shirt in a yellow-green color. Make sure that the shirt is a little large and fits like a tunic, ending midway down the thigh.Make sure that you or whoever the costume is for tries on the shirt before you purchase it. The tunic is an iconic part of the Peter Pan costume, so a short or tight shirt won’t look as good.
You can buy a regular T-shirt or polo shirt, or a shirt made from linen or another similar material for a more earthy feel.

, Peter Pan’s tunic is known for having a zig-zag cut along the bottom and the sleeves, giving it a playful look. Try on the shirt and use a pen to draw a large zig-zag pattern near the hem of the shirt and around the sleeves.If you are happy with the size of the shirt, make the zig-zag pattern close to the edge of the fabric. If you feel the shirt is too big, draw the zig-zag higher up, so that you will be able to cut the shirt to the length that you want.
Also draw a V along the neck of the shirt if it’s not already a V-neck.

, Lay the shirt down flat on a table and use a sharp pair of scissors to cut along the lines you drew on the shirt. Try to cut crisply and cleanly so that the shirt doesn’t look frayed or ragged. Try the shirt on again and look in a mirror. If you notice that the zig zag looks uneven, take the shirt off again and refine the cut., The cap is the most work intensive aspect of the costume since you will have to construct it yourself. You will need a yard of green felt, a pair of scissors, a needle or a sewing machine, green thread, a hot glue gun and a red feather. You can buy all these supplies at Hobby Lobby, Michaels or another art supply store.If you don’t want to sew, you can do a no-sew version of the cap by simply taking a green beanie and flipping up the edges. Glue a red feather to one side of the beanie to create a perfectly good Peter Pan cap!

, Draw a triangle with a pen onto the felt. The shape should be roughly the size of the cap as seen from the side, so make sure to make it large enough for your head or the head of the person the costume is for. Don’t draw a perfect triangle, instead make the top tip of the triangle curved as opposed to straight and off-center as opposed to directly centered.


To estimate what size the triangle should be, hold the cloth up to your head to get a good idea. Since the hat isn't going to be fitted snugly to your head, you just need to get an approximate estimate.

, Draw another shape that is roughly the shape of a knife blade, starting out as rectangular and ending in a pointed tip. This will be the brim of the hat. Make sure that the length of this section is about a ½ inch longer than the length of the rounded triangle you just made. Cut it out with a pair of scissors., Take the rounded triangle and the slanted piece of felt and lay them down on the remaining felt. Use a pen to trace around these shapes. Cut out the shapes with scissors to create identical copies of the shapes you already made., Line up the larger triangles by putting one triangle over the other. Use a needle and thread to sew using straight stitches.Sew the two pieces of fabric together along the sides of the triangle about 1 centimeter (0.4 in) from the edge, leaving the bottom open. You can also Use a Sewing Machine to sew the two pieces together.You are sewing along what will be the inside of the hat, so don't worry if your stitches aren't perfect.

, After you finish sewing the body of the cap, flip the cap right-side in to hide your stitches. Then one of the long slanted pieces of felt and place it so that it’s just overlapping the bottom edge of the cap on the inside. Pin the strip where it overlaps around the bottom of the cap. Do the same on the other side for the other piece of fabric, making sure that the thick ends are next to each other and the thin ends are touching., Using a needle and thread or a sewing machine, sew the brim piece along the bottom edge of the cap where you pinned it. Also sew lengthwise along the overlap where the two thick sides of each long triangle meet. After you are done sewing, remove the pins. Then flip up the pieces to make the brim! , Take a red long feather and stick it into one side of the hat in the brim. Make sure that the feather is pointed at a jaunty, 45 degree angle. When you are satisfied with the way it looks, glue it in place using the hot glue gun., Though your costume is almost finished, you will need a few more accessories to pull of the classic Peter Pan look. If you have a brown belt, cinch it across your waist over the green tunic. You can also tie a length of brown fabric or a rope at your waist if you don’t want to buy a belt., Peter Pan carries a small dagger at his side in a holster attached to his belt. Buy a small toy dagger at a Halloween store or a costume shop. If it doesn’t come with a holster simply keep it at your side tucked into your belt. Since it's a toy, there’s no chance of it hurting you!Don’t use a real knife. Even if you want to pull of a great costume, it’s not worth the risk of accidentally poking yourself!
You can also make a dagger out of cardboard and paint it to look like a knife.

, Wear a pair of brown or tan shoes with your costume, preferably moccasins or short boots. If you don’t have the perfect pair of shoes, don’t worry too much: people will be so impressed with your costume that they probably won’t be looking at your feet."

Spray your hair with hairspray and tease, or backcomb, your hair.,
Apply makeup.,
Use wax or liquid latex to create scars.",How to Make an Edward Scissorhands Costume," You can do this by unscrewing real scissors and attaching them to black gloves. Special effects artist Stan Winston and director Tim Burton used real, but custom made scissors in the film. They were not as sharp or dangerous as they appeared to be and it might be a good idea an alternative material. Consider using plastic blades, cut out cardboard painted silver, covered in tinfoil or silver duct tape. As long as the blades are lustrous silver, they should appear real enough.


Find yourself a pair of black gloves or dye an existing pair of gloves. They should be black to match Edward Scissorhands’ color scheme.
Thread resilient, black string into the glove and around the scissors so when you move your fingers, the blades move as well, giving the impression that your fingers are actually made of blades.;
, Although most of his clothing are leather-made, you can get away with other material such as jeans or a t-shirt as long as they are black and cover your entire. Turtlenecks work especially well since they are long-sleeved and cover the neck.

, Edward Scissorhands wears a vest that looks like it is made from sparingly studded belts. Fashion a vest out of three or four such belts and use another two or strips of leather to fashion the straps that go over his shoulders to hold it all in place. If the belts do not have any already, attach studs and hoops or chains in sporadic patterns on his belt and the rest of his clothing.

, While you can get away with using running shoes as long as they are all black, your costume would look more authentic with a pair of boots, if the boots have buckles on them. If you have boots of a different color, you can always paint them. Spray paint should be easiest, and although the boots’ color will fade over time, for a one time (or week long) use such as Halloween, they will be fine.

, Edward has dark black hair about six inches (15 cm) long, and if you decide you would rather not dye or cut your natural hair, you can always buy an Edward Scissorhands wig.

, This is accomplished by taking a combing your hair towards your scalp instead of away from it. This will give it the volume that Scissorhands sports.

, Use regular makeup instead of the Halloween/costume makeup. Use foundation to lighten your skin, not white, but a lighter color. Some dark eye shadow is also important underneath the eyes to give that sad, Edward Scissorhands look.

, The scars are remnants of accidental self-infliction, and they are mostly concentrated in the lower half of the face.

,, If the sleeves are visible, that's okay. They'll be hidden underneath your hood anyway.

, Do exactly what you did to form a headband, but don't place this one around your head. Just fold it up to create one strip of fabric. The width of the belt should depend on your size. Generally a little wider than your hand is a good width.

, The middle of the shirt should be around your stomach. It should be fairly taut. If it's not, you may be better off with a smaller t-shirt. You don't want an absolutely gargantuan tie at your back.

, Tuck the remaining ends into the belt. You'll have a bit of a bulge at your back, but it shouldn't be too noticeable. If you can see the neckline, tuck it away. It'll just be distracting.

, Fold the sleeves under so your shirt looks sleeveless. Make it a clean crease and try to avoid wrinkling or rolling the sleeves. Cutting the sleeves off can lead to asymmetrical lines if you're not a pro with a needle and thread, so it's best to stick to rolling them under.

, Don't take it off all the way! Just so it is on the back of your neck (while keeping your arms through the sleeves (or what used to be sleeves)). You should have something that resembles a strange vest around your arms.

, The collar should be pointing toward your navel at an angle. Tuck in the seam of the collar to get rid of the awkward lines.


Your thigh is not in the t-shirt. The t-shirt is simply draped over it.

, Tie off the sleeves in the back of your leg. Fold the knots under.


Then, tie off the bottom ends of the shirt behind your leg. Tuck away any loose ends or knots. Do this to both legs.

, Also do the same for your lower and upper arms (this may require assistance). Of course, you could just wear a long-sleeved t-shirt of the same color and you'll look just as good. But layers generally add to the persuasiveness of your outfit.

, This is the t-shirt and sweatpants that the rest of the outfit is geared around. Whatever you do, just choose one color -- any color. Even white ninjas exist.


Good colors are black, navy blue, red, and white. Of course, pink ninjas may be taken a little less seriously.

, If you are having someone tie on arm guards, do this now.


After those three are assembled and ready to go, add on your headband. Adjust everything so it's secure and looks good.

, This could be a sword, throwing stars, boots, or gloves. Get creative -- you are the ninja; there is no doing wrong. Ninjas don't make mistakes. If someone questions the authenticity of your ninja hood because you're wearing Doc Martens, that's when you put that steel toe to good use.

Gather your supplies.,
Measure the circumference of your head.,
Cut a piece of thick paper.,
Draw a circle with a six inch radius in your foam block.,
Glue the cylinder to the foam circle.,
Cover the cylinder and foam circle with your fabric.,
Tape your wire together securely so that it forms a circle.,
Glue more fabric to the bottom of your cylinder.,
Sew the excess cloth around your wire circle.",How to Make a Mad Hatter Costume1," You’ll need construction paper, a large foam block, some funky fabric, stiff wire, sewing tools, scissors, and glue.


Funky fabric should be some sort of fabric with an interesting or psychedelic design. Vintage pillow cases or drapes are good options here. You will only need about two square feet of fabric to cover your hat. Try to buy an old piece of fabric that has pinstripes or strange colors. This would match the Mad Hatter's look. You can even cut up an old shirt you find at a thrift store, or a curtain.;
, You need to know this in order to make a hat that will actually fit you. Use a cloth tape measure to measure your head. You may need someone to help you.

, The paper should be ten inches in height and the width should be the same as the circumference of your head. Now securely tape the two ends of the piece of paper together to form a large cylinder.


You can use multiple pieces of paper if one piece isn't large enough to cover your whole head.

, The radius is the distance from a center of a circle to its outer edge. It doesn’t have to be exact, just try to draw the best circle that you can. Cut it out with your scissors or a utility knife. It shouldn’t be more than one or two inches thick.

, The foam circle should be slightly larger than your paper cylinder, which will help to give the hat a Mad Hatter look. Try to center the cylinder in the middle of the foam circle. The foam circle will form the top of the hat. Cut off any excess foam.

, You should cut the fabric into smaller pieces to make it more workable. Try to stretch the fabric tight to the hat and fold it inside the cylinder to give the hat a more realistic look. Glue the fabric in place. Make sure to cover all the white on the paper and the foam.


Attach some lace to the brim of the hat if you want to add some depth.

, The radius of your wire circle should be two to three inches larger than the radius of your cylinder. Now cut another large piece of fabric using your cylinder as an outline. Cut the cloth about three inches wider so that you are able to wrap it all the way around the wire circle.

, Glue the fabric so that so that the majority of the cloth is hanging out the bottom in a circle. , You can also use pins to connect the wire circle to the paper cylinder, but it will be much less steady. Sewing is the best option. Once the wire is connected to the cylinder you’ll have finished the brim of your hat. "

Buy a pair of old green or purple pants and jacket.,
Make your pinstripes.,
Spray fabric spray paint in random areas on your clothing.",How to Make a Mad Hatter Costume2," Buy pinstripes if you can. You can choose a different color too, but make sure they look old and strange. The Mad Hatter's clothes were antiquated and interesting - that is part of the appeal. The more out of date your clothes look the better. Just don’t buy anything that you aren’t willing to damage.

, If you couldn’t find a pair of pants with pinstripes, use thin painter's tape to make your own pinstripes. Tear off long pieces of tape that run down the length of the pants or jacket and tape them on. This isn’t a permanent solution but for a one night event it will do the trick.

, If you bought purple pants and jacket, use a green spray-paint. Try to stick to dark colors. Black and white probably aren’t the best bet for this costume. You want the spray paint to look slightly psychedelic and otherworldly. You can buy fabric spray paint online or at your local crafts store.


Spray circles and color in larger portions of the jacket and pants using the fabric spray paint. This will give the impression that your clothing isn’t sure what color it is. The spray paint is a major addition to your costume.

"
"
Buy ten or twelve colored spools of thread.,
Thread a piece of yarn throughout the spools.,
Cut an old leather belt in half.,
Thread the yarn that is connected to the spools through the holes in the belt.",How to Make a Mad Hatter Costume3," You can buy these at a local craft store for relatively little money. Try to buy different colors for each spool. That will make the belt look cooler.


Take the labels off your spools. The Mad Hatter wasn’t buying his spools from a grocery store, so don’t make it look like you did.

, There are holes in the top and bottom of each spool, so run a piece of yarn throughout the spools. If you enter it through the bottom of one spool enter through the top of the next spool.

, You can find old belts for little money at any thrift store. Now make four holes in a square right next to where you made the cut on both pieces of the belt. You need eight holes in total. You can use a hole puncher or a utility knife. Be careful.

, Thread one end through four of the holes and the other end through the other four holes. You should run the thread through all four of the holes in such a way that you end up with a ‘X’ pattern. Once you’ve done that, tie the thread off and cut off any extra. The spools should be secured to the belt and you’re ready to wear it.

"
"
Add accessories to your hat.,
Use makeup.,
Consider buying some old gloves.,
Get yourself a cane.,
Draw the numbers 10/6 on an extra piece of construction paper.",How to Make a Mad Hatter Costume4," Try adding a ribbon and feathers to the top hat, or buttons, or really anything. Anything you can balance on that hat is fair game. , You can use some red lipstick in a messy way to add more zany flavor to the costume. You could also use white face make up from a costume store to make your face paler. Consider using some blue, green, or purple mascara too. , Thin riding or driving gloves are a good option, but remember the stranger the better.

, An older wooden cane is another component of the Mad Hatter costume. You can order a plastic cane online or find one at a costume store, but you also might be able to find a more legitimate looking wooden cane at a thrift store.

, Try to write in old antiqued font. Burning the edges is a good idea too. Glue this final accessory to your hat and you’ll be done. "

Have smooth luxurious skin.,
It's all about the hair.,
On to the make up.,
Work that body.,
Fashion.,
Sparkling teeth.,
Confidence is keen.,
Don't forget to be yourself.",How to Look Like Leighton Meester," Drink eight glasses of water a day, this will help to keep your skin clear by flushing out the toxins that we put into our bodies daily. Eat healthier foods, try cutting down the sugary snacks (but not cutting out completely) substitute chocolate and crisps for fruit such as oranges and grapes. Follow a cleansing ritual, I find that this is best done on an evening as most women have more time then than on a morning. Exfoliate once a week. Find a cleanser that suits your skin type, if you are unsure of what this could be then ask a sales adviser to assist you with this.;
, Leighton's hair is long, dark and glossy. If you want to have the same colour then you should dye your hair a medium chocolate brown colour and invest in some chestnut coloured low lights. High quality products are best for achieving Leighton's look. Once a week, use a good deep conditioner on your hair to achieve the same glossy look that she sports. You should try to grow your hair long, generally to about boob length, however if you struggle to grow your hair you could invest in some hair extensions. Clip-in hair extensions are the best for not damaging your hair and are certainly cheaper than their bonded counterparts. To achieve the big loose curls that Leighton wears then use some big rollers in your hair.

, Leighton has a very polished, bronzed look. Find a foundation that suits your skin type and that is as close to your skin tone as possible, to get Leighton's polished look then a liquid foundation will probably work best. Wear a thin line of black eyeliner on your upper eyelids, as close to the lash line as possible. Black mascara is a must for Leighton's look. She uses a coral bronzed blush on the apples of her cheeks. A soft lip balm is suited to her look for a day to day basis and for a special occasion, colours such as rose, peach/pink, beige/pink look great. If you are feeling daring then a rich red lipstick is always an eye popper.

, Leighton has a fabulous figure and with a little TLC, yours can be too. For optimum effects, join a gym. However, if you can't afford to join a gym, or that environment is not for you then start taking morning and evening walks/jogs. If your body is severely out of shape then you could go on a diet, but only do so after seeking advice from a doctor and a parent/guardian if you're under eighteen.

, Leighton's signature look is a dress. Dresses look fantastic on women of all shapes and sizes, you just need to find the style that compliments your body shape the most. Short dresses paired with some fashionable tights can make a cheap outfit look expensive and fantastic, as well as making the wearer look extremely feminine.

, Leighton's signature smile includes her sparkly white teeth. After brushing your teeth, use a whitening tooth polish to help brighten your teeth. If your teeth have yellow stains then you could go all out for a teeth whitening treatment, however this can be very costly. Do make sure to brush your teeth every day though.

, Make sure that you have good posture, don't slouch. Walk as though you don't have a care what anyone thinks of you and confidence will radiate from you.

, Although, you may want to be just like Leighton, the best look anyone can wear is themselves.

Consider making your own blaster using a water gun or a Nerf gun.",How to Dress Up Like Princess Leia," This will help you determine how long to make the dress and sleeves. It will also help you determine how much fabric to buy. Here are the areas you should measure:

Shoulder to floor. This is your ""height"" measurement.
Wrist to center of chest. This is your ""arm"" measurement.
Nape to waist. This is your ""back"" measurement.;
, It needs to be twice your height measurement, and twice your arm measurement. The best fabric to use is polyester with a knit-like weave. Cotton is too light and will not drape properly.

, Put the fabric down on the floor so that it looks like a vertical rectangle. Fold it in half horizontally so that you end up with a square. Then, with the folded part on top, fold the fabric in half vertically. You should end up with a rectangle shape, two folded parts: one on the top, and one to the side., Align the top of your arm with the top, horizontal fold. Align the center of your back with the side, vertical fold. Trace around your side and underarm. You should end up with something that looks like a 7. You want to trace several inches away from your body so that the dress is loose-fitting. Here are some other things to keep in mind:

The dress tapers outward towards the bottom.
The sleeves taper outward towards the wrists.

, Hem the sleeves and the bottom of the dress by 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) first. Then, unfold the dress so you end up with a T shape. Make sure that folded part of the hem is on the outside. Sew along the cut edges. Use a 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) seam allowance. Tie the ends of the threads into tight knots and snip off any excess. When you are done, flip the dress right-side-out.

The dress has slits up the sides. Sew the sides down just a little bit past your knees. Press the raw edges in by 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) and topstitch them down.Press the hems flat with an iron for a nice, crisp edge.

, The neck hole needs to be just a little bit smaller than the circumference of your neck. It will become larger as you add the seam allowance. Make the front part a little bit lower than the back part.

Cut a slit into the center back of the neck hole. Make the slit 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) long, and hem the edges inward. This will allow you to fit the costume over your head when you put it on.

, Cut a rectangle that is twice as long as your back measurement up to 19 inches (48 cm) tall. Hem both of the long sides by 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) and gather the narrow ends.

Princess Leia's hood is open in the back and in the front.
Children may require a shorter hood. Keep in mind, however, that Leia's hood is very large to begin with.

, Pin the gathered edges to the back of the dress; align the raw edge with the raw edge of the neck hole. The gathered part of the hood should not extend past the shoulder part of the dress. When you are done, remove the pins and tie the ends of the threads into knots. Snip any excess thread off.If the gathered edges are too long, tighten the gathering. If the gathered edges are too short, loosen the gathering.

, Cut out a rectangle that is 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) tall. The rectangle needs to be long enough to go around your neck hole, plus an additional 1 inch (2.5 cm) for seam allowance. Fold the rectangle in half, lengthwise, and sew up the narrow sides using a 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) seam allowance. Flip the rectangle inside out and press it flat., Pin the collar to the neck hole. Make sure that the narrow edges are aligned with the back slit. Use a 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) seam allowance. Press the hem down towards the dress (away from the collar) with an iron and top-stitch it down as close to the seam as you can. When you reach the hood, make sure that you topstitch under the hood; you should not topstitch on top of the hood.

Add two hook and eye closures to the back of the collar so that you can close it.

, You can buy one from a costume shop or a party supply store. Keep in mind that the quality of these costumes is not always the best. Despite this, you can always use the dress part, and use a different belt., Princess Leia wore a white, loose-fitting gown with a hood and long, flowing sleeves. Try to find a white tunic dress that has long, loose sleeves. Get a white pillowcase and cut open the side seam. Hem the cut part inward by 0.5 inches (1.3 cm). Gather the two narrow edges with a running stitch, then sew them to the neck part of your dress, using a 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) seam allowance.

, If you want a Princess Leia-inspired outfit, consider going for a simple, white dress, tall white boots, and a silver belt. Finish off the look with Princess Leia makeup and buns., Try to keep the pigtails as centered as possible, about 1 inch (2.5 cm) above your ear.

This method is great for those who have very long hair—at least elbow-length.

, You can also braid it instead. If you choose to braid it, be sure to tie the end off with a hair tie., Princess Leia's buns are not like regular buns. Rather, they are coiled, like cinnamon buns. This is the effect you are going for., Once you reach the end of your hair, tuck the ends under your bun and secure them with a bobby pin., Space the bobby pins 0.5 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) apart. How many bobby pins you use depends on how thick and heavy your hair is.

If necessary, you can also use bobby pins inside the bun to hold it together.

, Try to coil your bun in the same direction as you coiled the first one. This way they will match. For example, if you coiled the first bun away from your face, coil the second one away from your face as well., Use a hair spray with the strongest hold you can find., Try to choose a pair whose color matches your hair color. For example, if you have brown hair, choose brown socks, if you have blond hair choose beige or tan socks, and so forth. You will be using these socks to make sock buns.

This method is great for those who have at least shoulder-length hair.

, Take a sock and fold the cut each down outward by 0.5 inches (1.3 cm). Continue rolling the sock until you have a doughnut shape. Repeat the process for the other socks., Try to make each pigtail as centered as possible. They should rest about 1 inch (2.5 cm) above your ears. They should not be at the base of your neck or at the top of your head., Set the other sock ring aside for later. It will be easier to do one sock bun at a time., Pull the sock bun all the way down to the end of your hair. Wrap the hair ends around the sock bun. Try to keep them as even as possible., Using both hands, start rolling the sock ring towards your head. Feed new hair through the center of the sock ring. Don't worry if your bun is a little messy at first; it will become smoother the more you roll it., Once you have rolled the sock bun all the way to the base of the pigtail, you will need to pin it in place. Take up to four bobby pins, and use them to pin your sock bun to your head. Plan on using a bobby pin on the top, bottom, and both sides of the sock bun.,, Once you have the sock buns rolled and pinned, you can use your fingers to gently fluff the buns up further. You can also smooth any stray hairs down using a bit of water. Once you are done, spray your hair with strong-holding hair spray., Start with washing your face using a facial cleaner suitable for your skin type. Pat your face dry, then wipe some toner over it to tighten your pores. Spread some moisturizer over your face.

If you want, you can apply a face primer once the moisturizer dries. Face primer will help fill in pores and tiny lines, making your face look smoother.

, Choose a color that matches your skin tone. You can use any type of foundation you want: liquid, cream, or powder. You can even use a tinted moisturizer if you don't like wearing too much makeup., If you have a warm skin tone, choose something that is more peach or coral tinted. If you have a cool skin tone, choose something that is more berry tinted., Princess Leia has very rosey lips; not quite pink, but not striking red either. If you have a warm skin tone, choose something that is more coral-red. If you have a cool skin tone, choose something that is more berry-red.

If you have very dark skin, you can get away with using red lipstick.

, Use a cream or ivory color on your brow bone, and a neutral brown on your eyelid and crease. Finish off with a touch of ivory or cream on the inner corners of your eyes. Apply the eye shadow with makeup brushes. Be sure to blend them in.

If you have very ark skin, these colors might be too light for you. Instead, choose a color that is several shades lighter than your skin tone for the brow bone and inner corners. Choose a color that is several shades darker than your skin tone for the eyelid and crease.

, Choose an eyeliner pencil, and apply a thin line of eyeliner along your top and bottom lashes. Do not add a cat eye or wingtip., You can do this by brushing on some brown or dark brown eye shadow over the eyeliner. You can also just smudge the eyeliner using a Q-tip or eyeliner smudger., Brush it onto both the upper and lower lashes., You can use a setting spray o a setting powder., You can also try using black boots instead. They are not quite what Princess Leia wore, but they will match the costume well.


Try to get boots that are about knee-high.

, If you can't find the right boots, get a pair that are about knee-high and fit you well. Paint them white using white fabric paint or spray paint., If you can't find one, try getting a wide white belt and drawing octagons or rectangles on it using silver paint or permanent marker. You can also go for a silver belt instead.

, Find some wide, grey satin ribbon. Cut the ribbon 2 inches (5.1 cm) longer than your waist measurement. Glue a 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide strip of Velcro to each end of the ribbon. Put the ribbon on at your wait, and close it in the back., Wear the belt with the pointed part facing downward. The belt closes at the back. You will need white vinyl or craft foam and silver or grey vinyl or craft foam. Here is how to make the belt:Cut a piece of white vinyl or craft foam long enough to circle your waist with a 1 inch (2.5 cm) overlap. The belt is 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) high, with a v-shaped point down the center.
Cut one pentagon out of silver/grey vinyl or craft foam. Glue it down in the center of the belt. Align the point of the pentagon with the point of the belt.
Cut seven elongated octagons out of silver/grey vinyl or craft foam. Glue three to one side of the pentagon, and four to the other. Make sure that they are evenly spaced, and that you are not covering the Velcro.
Glue a 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide strip of Velcro to the narrow ends of the belt to close it.
Cut eight circles out of silver/grey vinyl or craft foam. Glue each one on top of each pentagon and octagon.

, Many conventions will not allow un-holstered guns, unless they have the tip painted safety orange. Also, most movie theaters will not allow any prop guns of any sort, even if they are toys.

When buying a Star Wars blaster, look for a one that is black, and at least arm-length.

, Find a water gun or a Nerf gun that has the right shape. Take it outside and spray paint it black using a matte, black spray paint. Apply the paint in a light, even coat. Wait for the paint to dry, then apply a second coat, if necessary. Once the paint dries, flip the gun over and spray the other side.

Most spray paint will stick to plastic, but it won't be very durable. To make your paint job durable, make sure you are using a spray paint that is intended for plastic. Also, you might want to coat the gun with a layer of spray paint primer first. This will help the paint stick better.
It is better to apply many thin coats rather than one thick coat. If you apply the paint too thickly, you may get drips and puddles. Also, the paint may not dry properly.
Know that not all places allow any prop guns. Before you make your blaster, it might be a good idea to check the prop rules of the event you are attending.

A jersey material will work well once you accessorize the look.You could also wear a long-sleeved black shirt. Try to get a V-neck or scoop-neck style shirt that fits closely around your body. Tuck the shirt into your pants to make your look more seamless.;
, These should fit you snugly. Ideally, the material will be leather; however, you can still rock the Black Widow look with black jeans.

, The boots should be black, have three buckles that wrap around the leg at three different heights, and have either a low or wedge heel.

, The jacket should have a front zipper and fit you tightly. A leather jacket will most closely resemble Black Widow’s look, but a pleather or suede material will also work.

, Finding pre-made bullet bracelets will not be an easy task, since they are an unusual item. However, you can create your own a number of different ways:


Purchase a bullet belt from an online retailer like Amazon or from a costume store. Cut it so that it is small enough to fit around your wrist, and superglue this smaller section of the belt to a black bangle bracelet. You will need 2 bullet bracelets, one for each wrist.Spray-paint crayons black and gold. The coloring should be gold from the pointy, coloring end of the crayon to the middle and black from the middle to the flat top. Let the paint dry and superglue the crayons to two bangle bracelets. Similarly-shaped items, like toy drop whistles, will also work well when painted.

You can buy gold Crayola crayons in bulk from an online retailer like Amazon. This way, you only have to paint half the crayon black.



, This is an accessory that adds to Black Widow’s edgy, unique style. The thigh holster should wrap around your hips and will ideally have three pouches, as in the movie. You can find a thigh holster online by shopping for SWAT or Tomb Raider costumes at stores like Spirit Halloween.


You can also look up holsters at an army supply store like OPSGEAR or Army Surplus World.
Alternatively, you could superglue a black cell phone pouch to a black heavy-duty strap and tie the strap around your thigh.

, You can purchase a prop gun online from a store like Replica Airguns or from a costume store. A cheaper option would be to purchase a toy gun - even a water gun - and paint it black., In addition to the thigh holster, Black Widow wears a belt that sits higher on the waist. This belt is broad, made of cloth, and has a plain silver quick release buckle in the center.Amazon sells heavy duty law enforcement belts that resemble the one worn by Black Widow, but a regular military-looking belt will do.

, You can find a close approximation to the black, leather biker gloves worn by Black Widow at most stores which sell motorcycle accessories. A cheaper option would be to wear cloth fingerless gloves., Online retailers like WigIsFashion or wigs.com sell red wigs for around $60. Choose a style that is slightly wavy so as to most closely resemble Black Widow., While more time-consuming and permanent than wearing a wig, dyeing your hair can look more realistic. Black Widow’s hair color is a burnt red, so aim to find a dye that is not too flashy - the more natural the color looks, the more believable your costume will be.A semi-permanent dye, which you can buy at a retailer like Sally Beauty, is a good option if you want to wear the costume multiple times in the span of a few days or if you want a temporary change of look, as it will last you three to six weeks but won’t flake., Black Widow’s wears minimal makeup, so all you have to do to get the right lip color is apply a medium pinkish or peach lipstick. Try to choose a lip color that subtly enhances your own rather than one that is too bright or that looks unnatural.

, Black Widow doesn't wear much makeup, but a generous amount of mascara does make her eyes stand out. Double-coat your lashes or add fake eyelashes to enhance your Black Widow look.


Line your eyes with black eyeliner for even more definition.There are several tutorials on YouTube that you could use to guide your eye makeup application - simply look up “Black Widow makeup” to get the most relevant results."

, You can either use a cloth, or paint a wall. For a cloth green screen, place your green screen on an even surface, like a wall, and secure it so that it does not fall in the middle of a scene. Make sure that the cloth's surface is as flat as possible by stretching out the corners and sides until there are no wrinkles in the fabric. If using paint, first sand the wall to make it smooth, and then apply a primer coat of paint. After the primer dries, paint an even final coat. Any harsh shadows will show up during post-production and may interfere with the editing process. See ""Tips"" below for paint formula.

, In order to light a green screening studio, you will need a number of strong lights. The best kind of lights to use are powerful work lights, as the light they give off takes up a large area. Place lights on both sides of your screen and behind your actor so that they are facing the green screen. Position them so that the entire green screen is one unanimous shade of green, and that no part is darker than the rest.

, Set these lights up just like in any other movie studio. You will need a strong key light on either the left or right side and a fill light to get rid of any harsh shadows on the other side. Stand your actor in front of the green screen to test the lights and make sure that the subject lights are not casting any harsh shadows. If they are, redirect them by turning the key and fill lights around and using white cards to bounce the light at your actor.

, Place a work light above the green screen and shine it at where your actor will stand. This is used as an aid to help green screening programs separate the actor from the green screen by making a bolder outline on your actor.

, Play with the lights a while to make sure they are perfect. Turn on and off the lights installed in your ceiling to see if it helps or not.

, Place your actor in front of the screen to test out your lighting scheme. Make sure that he is not too close to the green screen, or his shadow will appear on your green screen. Keep him there for the next steps.

, Place your camera(s) where you wish to put it/them. If you are only filming one angle for a commercial or anything of the like, you only need one camera. If you are filming with multiple angles, you will have to play around with the lighting to make sure your other cameras don't interfere with your lighting scheme. Look through the view finder to place your camera(s) in the right place. It is advisable to use a tripod. Run through a few actions like jumping up and down and to the side and stepping back and forth while looking through the view finder to ensure that your actor has enough space to act comfortably. This is where space comes in. If you chose a small room for a studio, you might only have a foot or two of space that your actor can work in, while if you chose a large area, you'll be much better off.

, Film a test run of your green screen studio to make sure that everything is good. If you see something wrong, fix it!

Each camera needs a reference signal from the switcher to be able to synchronize with a master heartbeat or genlock video signal.,For each pair of BNC cables, use tape to label one cable as ""REF"" on both ends and the second cable ""VID"" on both ends.,
At the switcher (or VDA) connect one end of the cables labeled ""REF"" to any BB connector.,
At the cameras, connect the cable labeled ""REF"" to the ""REF IN"" or the ""GEN IN"" connector.,Find the ""PROGRAM OUT"" connector on the back of the switcher and use a BNC cable to hook it up to a color monitor.,
Find the switch on the cameras (or the CCUs) that turn on the camera's internal color bars.,
At this point, an engineer would use a waveform monitor and vectorscope to accurately time the system but if you had an engineer, you would not be reading this tutorial and it is beyond the scope of this ""how-to"" to explain the use of a waveform and vectorscope.,
Set up a ""horizontal wipe"".,
On the PREVIEW bus, punch up switcher COLOR BARS if the switcher has built in color bars.,
On camera one itself (or on the CCU) find the adjustment for ""H-PHASE"".,
Tweak on the H-PHASE adjustment until the camera bars line up vertically pretty nicely with the switcher bars.,
Repeat this procedure adjusting camera two with the timed CAM 1 in PREVIEW and CAM 2 in PROGRAM.,
Now that the cameras are ""horizontally timed"", go back to camera one and find the S/C PHASE (sub-carrier phase) adjustment.,
Repeat the procedure that was performed with the horizontal phase except adjust the S/C and try to match the colors, first with the switcher bars and then (more importantly) with each other.,
When none of the cameras jump or tear when you push the switcher buttons and slide the T-bar and the color bars match, you can now switch back from bars to camera images.",How to Synchronize Multiple Cameras to a Video Switcher," AV mixers and some of the newest switchers have automatic timing. Just plug in the cameras and they work. Older professional switchers have connectors in back that are labeled ""Ref In"", ""S/C"" and ""BB"" among other rows of inputs and outputs.
, Only pro cameras are ""genlockable"". Look for a BNC connector on the camera that is labeled GEN or REF IN. Non-pro cameras will require a second piece of equipment called a ""Time Base Corrector"" or TBC. (See Tips)., Two, equal length BNC cables will be needed for each camera. They will need to be long enough to reach from the camera position to the switcher. If you happen to have a multipin camera cable that connects to a camera control unit (CCU), then the cables only need to reach the CCU. A bunch of shorter cables will be handy for monitors and other auxiliary items., Usually this is in the form of a type of signal called blackburst (BB). Blackburst is simply a black video signal that carries the synchronization information from the switcher to external devices. Look for multiple blackburst connectors on the back of the switcher. One is needed for each camera. If there are not enough, you'll need to acquire a Video Distribution Amplifier (VDA). A VDA simply takes a single video input and multiplies it into several outputs. To use one for reference purposes, connect one of the BB outs to the input of the VDA. The outputs of the VDA are now all blackburst outputs that can be used as reference signals.,, Connect one end of the cables labeled ""VID"" to consecutive, numbered INPUT connectors., Connect the cable labeled ""VID"" to the ""VIDEO OUT"" connector. Make sure the cameras also have power. If you are using multipin camera cable and a CCU, make these same connections to the CCU instead of the camera.,, When you flick that switch to bars, you should see color bars on the monitor for each camera as you press the corresponding numbered button in the PROGRAM bus (row of buttons). The picture will jump a little as you punch the buttons., The following method will get you close enough., Do this by punching a button labeled ""WIPE"" (located near the T-bar) and also dialing in or punching a button in the ""PATTERNS"" section that will produce a simple horizontal transition. Moving the T-bar located between the PROGRAM and PREVIEW bus should produce a wipe effect on the monitor; probably a distorted effect., On the PROGRAM bus, punch up CAM 1. (If the switcher does not have built in color bars, set this up between CAM one in PREVIEW and CAM 2 in PROGRAM.), This stands for horizontal phase. Usually this is a tiny screwdriver adjustment. Sometimes it is done through a menu system with arrow buttons. It may take some looking under hidden panels to find it., Moving the T-bar up and down, there should be no jump in either of the extreme positions. (In the case that there are no switcher bars, center the bars and make little H-PHASE adjustments until there is no jumping or tearing when the T-bar is moved to its extremes. For now, ignore any color differences., Work down the line until you can wipe between any two cameras without a jump., You will find it in the same area as the H-PHASE adjustment., If you have no reference for color bars on the switcher, you'll have to eyeball what looks right., The system is timed. All that is left is to black balance and white balance and properly set the iris control."

Resourcefulness.,
Create a realistic estimate of how much your short film will cost.,
Incorporate your film company if you plan on raising more than $25,000.,
Create a separate bank account for your film fund.

,
Draw up a business plan to present to potential film investors.

,
Create a website or social media outlet to give your film a public face and so that film investors can regularly view information about your project.,
Apply for public and private grants that fund films.,
Enter filmmaker funding competitions.

,
Approach local businesses and professionals who have contributed to independent films in the past.,
Investigate ""crowd funding"" projects like Kickstarter and IndieGoGo, websites on which artists can post projects and raise small funds from thousands of interested supporters.

,
Invite your investors to witness your film production and include them as much as possible in the process.

",How to Fund a Short Film," Make the most of the resources you have locally by listing all the locations, props, actors, equipment and crew available locally and use this to develop a cost effective idea.;
, Be liberal with your cost projections.


A serious pitfall for many short film producers is cost overrun after they have raised their initial goal. It's better to spend more time raising too much money than to find yourself in a situation where your film is half-done and you are out of funds.

,


Incorporation creates separate bank accounts for your film and for your personal life. If your film goes bankrupt, funds from your personal accounts will not be liable for collection.

,,,


Your business plan should be around 10 pages and should included detailed information about production costs, anticipated shooting time, locations, and predicted revenue. Provide a detailed budget.
Be sure to include information about yourself and the other people working on the film. Also indicate other sources from which you hope to raise money. Film investors will want to know that your team is responsible and that you will have enough money to cover all your costs.

,


Some well known institutions that provide film grants include the National Endowment for the Arts in the United States and the Canada Council. Also seek out local arts groups and corporate foundations.

,,


Ask these businesses and professionals for a modest amount of money. Be frank about your expected costs, and do not promise any return on investment.

Edit your film.",How to Make a Short Documentary Film," Remember, you'll need to complete the project. Think about who, what, and where you'll shoot. Form a basic idea for a story and if you're having trouble, read short stories for inspiration.;
, Once you have worked out what style of documentary you are going to make, analyze similar documentaries to identify conventions. Make sure you pay attention to the documentaries narrative structure, as this is where most amateur documentary filmmakers go wrong.

, This initial document should include a summary of the documentary, and the goal or purpose of the film. Outline your script, covering each major section but keeping the outline under 300 words.

, You will need to have a script, or you can't have a film. While thinking of an idea, make sure you write something attractive to your viewers. For example, If you're giving the script to someone who likes drama, add lots of drama. Comedy, add comedy, etc.

, From your outline identify priority scenes.

, Don't worry about following the storyboard perfectly. It's just a good idea to get your thoughts on paper and a great way to see if you can communicate an idea ""visually"" rather than needing the actors to verbally communicate the concept. The viewer is watching first and listening second.


If you prefer a more structured approach, create a shot-by-shot list of all your camera work.

, Show what you have so far to friends, family, teachers, etc. Polish your work until you're ready to film.

, Brainstorm the worst things that could happen during making your documentary and how will you deal with these. Remember to look at both technical problems and story problems.

, Choose the equipment, something that can record video. There are many choices. This process might take months or even years, but you have to keep looking. Make sure your video recorder works with your VCR or editing equipment.

, Learn how to start and stop recording, fast forward, rewind, playback, and anything else that you might need. Save the special effects for your second or third project.

, Provide food for your crew. They'll appreciate it and be able to hang around longer.

, This will keep you focused on your project.


Get a diary.
Identify what days you and your crew is available.
Jot down priority scenes.
Film interviews early on.

, If you want to highlight your pet, you can shoot video of your pet eating, sleeping and playing and perhaps put it to music. If you are under a tight time pressure, consider using a second camera as this will enable you to be twice as efficient.

,


Plan questions. The easiest way of doing this and keeping focus is to write who, what, when, where, why, how, and then brainstorm questions around these.
Subject must be comfortable around the camera and open and honest.
Talk to them before filming, you could talk for half an hour or more to make the subject comfortable around you.

, Keep a diary where you write how the filming went, what mistakes you made and how you could avoid these next time and ideas for what to film on other shoots.

, Before you proceed to editing your film watch all your footage through, writing notes on every shots stating if it works, are there technical problems. This will save you a lot of time when editing.

, Many cameras edit in limited ways and some have special effects. Learn how to ""cut"" pieces of your footage together and put music or speech over your video. Check your camera's manual or use a software package like iMovie to make your final cuts. One way is to use your VCR or DVD burner to make copies for friends and auditions. If your film is digital, you can also output your final edit to a readable format to send via email. Also if your film is in digital format you can upload to YouTube or another video sharing site. Check up with the website's video formats to see if you can upload your movie.

Look at your setup.,
Develop your drawing skills.,
Use your money wisely, whether you want animation to be a hobby or a career.,
Choose what fits your needs.,
Have fun!",How to Make Professional Digital Animations on a Budget," What do you have that could be used to animate? A computer with decent specs? A scanner? A tablet such as the iPad, or an Android? All of these things can be used for animating! You could draw a frame on paper, then clip it to a lite-brite! Then you just clip a blank sheet of paper on top of the old frame, turn on the lite-brite, and trace over the old frame! Anything could be useful when used correctly!






;
, Sketch some wildlife or buildings as practice and evaluate how well you can draw. Animating has more to do with drawing than anything else. If you are a poor drawer but also want to animate as a job, consider buying professional animation tools.








, Always get the appropriate gear -- never buy tools that were made cheaply. You can't go into combat with a cardboard sword, right? Also, don't overspend. Why buy the best golf club if you rarely go golfing? Or even if you golf all the time, you shouldn't pay $500 just to get your club gold-plated. Buy what you need. No more, no less.








, If you choose to draw digitally, get a drawing tablet ($20-70). This is basically a mouse for your computer that's controlled by a pen. Most of them, however, don't have screens. The Wacom Cintiq has a screen, but prices have been known to exceed a thousand dollars.

If you want a screen, you can buy a cheap Android tablet with a resistive screen, and then use a DSI stylus with it. Once getting the tablet, download a drawing/animating app on the Play Store. Recommended: Animator's Desk, which has a free version.














, Just like with normal drawings, frames drawn by the animator only reflect how the animator feels. If you feel happy, you'll draw bold, vibrant straight lines. If you feel sad or hurt, you'll draw more jagged, crooked lines, and your work will feel less exciting. If you don't enjoy animating, you certainly won't enjoy sitting in one position for hours to make a mediocre animation. It takes a lot of time and patience -- and enjoyment. I hope this tutorial gave you some ideas for cheap-budget animation. Enjoy making your animations!

Find a captivating, accessible subject.,
Do as much outside research as you can.,
Decide on an ""angle"" for your documentary.,
Get a camera, several microphones, and a few lights.,
Write out a shooting script for your documentary.,
Draft a budget and shooting schedule.,
Put together your crew.",How to Make a Documentary1," Documentaries are films about real-life subjects, bringing together interviews, documents, footage, and narration to tell the story of a person, place, or event. Is there a story you believe needs to be told? Is there an interesting person in your area with a captivating tale? Since documentaries are grounded in fact, you need to choose a subject that you can get information and interviews on easily. Thus, a filmmaker with limited means will have a hard time filming a documentary about the Revolution in Syria, even though is is a captivating subject.


Keep your subject small -- the best documentaries delve deeply into one topic instead of trying to cover many topics briefly.
What sorts of documentaries do you enjoy watching? What sorts of subjects are captivating to you. There is very little that can't be examined closely, including people, cultures, and events:


The Fog of War, one of the decade's biggest documentaries, is almost completely filled up by an interview with one man, ex-Secretary of State Robert McNamara.

Happy People by famed documentary Werner Herzog explores the daily life of Siberian fur hunters throughout the course of one, ""normal"" year.

Inequality for All is an accessible but comprehensive look at the 2007 financial crisis as narrated by UC Berkeley Professor Robert Reich.

Supersize Me was shot with one man and one camera, asking what would happen if you ate McDonalds for every meal for a month.

;
, Before you pick up a camera, you need to be as much of an expert as humanly possible. Conduct some early interviews for practice and send informal emails asking for advice to relevant professors, spokespeople, or friends of your subject. Go to the library and read as much as you can about your subject. This will help you ask good, informed questions and find the most interesting bits of the story to explore.


Keep a notebook with all your notes in it and make sure you list your sources so that they can be accurately cited in the credits.
Look at both sides of divisive issues, not just the one you agree with the most. You need to understand everyone's opinions to interview well.
Research everything you can when you start out -- your subjects, people you want to interview, the historical background of your site. There are a lot of facts that, when brought together, can tell a story no one has ever heard.
Watch a lot of documentaries, especially those related to your subject. What do they do well? What can you do better? Who do they talk to?

, The angle is the way you want to take the story. Who do you want to interview? What do you want to focus on? It is impossible to say everything about a subject in a few hours of film. You need to think about where you focus is going to be as you start filming. This will help you develop questions, write out a script, and choose how to spend your money when you start filming.


This angle may change as you start interviewing people. The documentary Queen of Versailles, for example, was originally about one woman's daily life. But when financial ruin suddenly hit the main ""character,"" filmmaker Lauren Greenfield shifted her angle to focus on the effects of the financial crisis on the billionaire class., The needs of every documentary are different. Though a huge nature chronicle, like Planet Earth, requires helicopters, HD cameras, and thousands of crew members, smaller shoots like Marwencol can get by with one decent camera and several lapel microphones. When in doubt, spend your money on a microphone -- audiences will notice bad sound much faster than bad video.Lapel mics are small microphones that attach to a shirt or collar and are needed for interviews.
Clamp lights, which are $5-$10 at most hardware stores, are versatile and cheap alternatives professional lights used on many low-budget projects. If you can afford a 3 or 5 piece lighting kit, however, get one.
Be inventive getting your equipment. The doc My Date with Drew was shot for almost nothing on a camera from Circuit City that the director returned after 30 days to get his money back., This may change, but it is still essential to help you plan out your shoot and spend your budget wisely. Even if you don't want to use a narrator, write out the story as if you are talking through it. While there are a lot of ways to structure a story, you should always remember that a documentary is a film. It is not a lecture, a lesson, or a commercial. Thus, it needs to be entertaining. Think of your documentary in three parts, then find the interviews, clips, or facts that are needed to make each part successful:



Act 1 -- The Problem. Why is this documentary important? What is compelling, interesting, or unique about your subject? What history, facts, or backstory is essential to your documentary?

Act 2 -- The Obstacles: What is getting in the way of success/happiness/resolution. What conflicts or issues have evolved because of The Problem? Is your subject changing, and how does that affect the world around them? Why does this problem exist, and is anyone trying to fix it?

Act 3 -- The Resolution: Does the problem resolve? Is it possible to resolve? What can the audience, narrator, hero, or subject do in the future? How have the subject(s) changed since the beginning of the documentary?, Once you know where you need to go, who you need to interview, and how long you have to shoot, it is time to make a plan of action. Contact the people you want to interview and schedule a time that works well for them. Once you know your interviews, budget out the cost of each interview accordingly (any crew members, rental of lights/camera, etc.) and figure out how much money you need and how long you have to shoot.


Set aside money to buy music and film rights.Shooting recreations, where you get actors to act out historical events, gets expensive quickly. You should expect to drop $5,000 or more for a weekend of shooting, especially if you're paying actors and/or need to rent equipment. Remember, you need to provide some food, work lights, pay actors/crew, and more.
Apply to local grants, ask relatives or friends if they want to help finance the movie, or find ways to shoot your movie on a smaller budget. Documentaries rarely win back the money cost to shoot them. You need to shoot this because you want to, not because you think it will get you rich., You can film the entire documentary yourself, but it will be slow, difficult, and often amateurish. Enlist your friends to help run cameras and lights as you interview people so that you can focus on asking good questions. Head to Craiglist and ask local filmmakers if they want to help work. However, you should always be upfront and honest in your posting -- if you can't afford to pay someone, say so. There are still a of students who just want film experience. Some positions to consider hiring include:


Cameramen
Lighting Specialists
Researchers
Film Editors
Actors (for scripted sequences/recreations)

Always check in with your talent agent on the eve of your assignment.,
Know the expected working hours.,
Provide your own transportation to every job.,
Map out where you need to go before you head to set.

,
Make sure you have all your wardrobe sorted the day before you head to set.,
Be punctual.,
Bring snacks.,
Arrive at the location at least 15 minutes prior to your call time.,
Check in with the appropriate person when you arrive to set.,
Listen and follow directions at all times.,
Know what not to bring to the film set.,
Maintain your manners.,
Let people know you've popped out to the bathroom.,
Be observant.,
Alert people when you do things or take things.,
Work hard, but don’t overdo it.,
Take a call sheet at the top of the day or print one the night before.,
If on a longer job, don't be afraid to ask for a one liner if you're an extra or silent.,
Learn the following so that you'll be well prepared when on set:


""Action"" - The camera is rolling.",How to Behave on a Film Set," This is to verify location, directions and call times.;
, Don't make other arrangements that will cause you anxiety; by knowing the hours in advance, you'll be ready to stay for as long as it takes.

, Ensure you have this prepared before you commit to a job regardless of where set may be.

,, Arrive ready with any other tools you need to do your job.

, Don't aim for prima donna status, especially without a solid history of your worth to back you. Always call the on set contact or talent agent if you will be late or are unable to attend a job.


Note: Do not wait until the last minute. This is a big fail and could cause you to be scrapped from the production.

, Meals are generally provided by the production if you are on set before and after a lunchtime hour. However bring your own snacks and water to the set, just in case. If you have specialist dietary needs, discuss ahead or bring your own on the first day at least.

, This will allow time for parking and wardrobe. Do some networking, learn where the equipment is, read the call sheet, have a coffee. Do whatever it takes to prepare yourself for the day.

, This person is referred to as your 'on set contact'.


At top of the day, report to your department head, introduce yourself and be respectful.

, Whether you're an extra or the leading star, the director and others in charge will expect you to be all ears and ready to do as asked.


When given instructions in person or over the walkie talkie be sure to acknowledge by saying ""copy"" or ""copy that"". Do not copy if you do not fully understand the instructions. Feel free to repeat back, ask questions or do whatever it takes to fully understand what you are being instructed to do.
Constructive discussion about what might work better will depend on how open the director is to listening. Be aware of your director's openness to discussion before trying to make suggestions. If you're an extra, expect that you won't be listened to unless you're a known expert in whatever it is (such as being a maker of medieval armor).

, Never bring cameras, alcohol/drugs, or family and friends on a job. Some sets do allow personal photography, but always ask prior to showing up with a camera.


Drug and alcohol use is frowned upon on set. It could be enough to get you fired.

, Keep your mouth shut and your ears open.


Respect the chain of command.
Be polite, say please and thank you.
Learn people’s names. This is a big one, camera department gets to cheat and tape the actors grid that's on the call sheet to the camera, others aren't so lucky.
Be watchful and respectful of your co-workers. Just because farting is okay on the grip truck doesn’t mean its okay in front of the talent.

, When in need of a washroom break be sure to tell your boss. In film school you might have been told to always tell the Assistant Director as well. That is great in theory, but on larger sets the AD has so much to deal with that they really don't need to know which tech is pooping. You are fine as long as your boss knows and someone is around to cover you. Now, that goes for lower level crew mainly, as a cinematographer or any higher up position, the AD must be told.

, Watch your boss and be aware of what is going on in your department and around you.


Allow others to do their jobs, don’t be a hero. Don't chirp in about things that have nothing to do with you or your department.

, For example, when turning on a light, flying in track, dolly or anything in general, call it out. Don't just walk on to set with a 10 foot (3.0 m) chunk of metal. That's how people get hurt.


If you want to help another department, ask them if they need it first. A simple “may I?” before moving a camera case or stand can save you a lot of grief later. The bigger the set the less likely you will be allowed to touch anything that doesn't belong to your department.
Do not just plug items into any available outlet. Never unplug anything. Always ask a set electrician.

, ""Work smart, not hard"" is a good motto to follow, but that doesn’t mean be lazy. Pace yourself, the days are long and there will be plenty of work.

, In most cases, many of your questions can be answered by looking at the call sheet.

, It can help you to be ready for future days.

, Everyone must be in their assigned spots and doing what is instructed to them.
""Background"" - Extras must be in their assigned spots and doing what is instructed to them.
""Back to One"" - Return to your starting position for shot.
""Blocking"" - Preplanned movement in a scene.
""Call Time"" - The time you are required to be on the set.
""Continuity"" - Doing everything exactly as it was done in the previous take.
""Cut"" - Stop all action.
""Extras"" - Paid / non-paid actors.
""Flashing"" - This is said, only when the film/videotape is not running and someone is using their flash photography to take photos. It helps everyone to know that none of the various light bulbs have blown.
""Quiet On The Set"" - All voices quiet
""Places"" or ""Places everyone"" - This means that were ever you are assigned to be, please head immediately and quietly to that spot and await further instructions
""Speed/Rolling"" - Film is moving.

Make sure any people in the documentary sign release forms if they appear on camera.,
Prepare your interview set before the person arrives.,
Write out a list of questions in advance.,
Sit and talk with the interviewee before turning the cameras on.,
Let the film speak for itself, instead of trying to speak for it.,
Find the points of view you disagree with.,
Shoot B-Roll at every location you visit.,
Keep any recreations simple and faithful to the source material.",How to Make a Documentary2," A release form legally allows you to show someone on screen, and forgetting them can lead to costly lawsuits. In addition, most distributors won't show or buy your movie if you do not have this basic legal protection.When thinking about release forms, it is always better to be safe than sorry. If they say something on camera you need to have a release form, always.
You may also need location release forms for any public locations and release forms for archived documents.You can download and customize basic release forms online for free.

, You do not want your subject sitting around while you fiddle with lights, cameras, and microphones. You and your crew should have everything ready to go in advance so that they can sit down and start talking without a lot of hassle. Make sure the sound is clear and perform a quick microphone check with your subject so that you can adjust them to their speaking volume.Have a friend do a ""practice run"" with you, where you light them, set up the microphones and record 3-4 minutes of talking to make sure everything is set properly.
If you are doing the interview, place a camera over your shoulder, roughly centered on the interviewee's face. Place another over their shoulder pointing back at you. The interviewee should, in general, not be looking right at the camera.Remove distractions from the backgrounds. The focus is on the interview, not the scenery.

, Trying to show up and ""wing it"" is a recipe for disaster. You never know how someone will act in front of the camera, and someone you think is well-spoken and articulate could resort to one-word answers when you record. You need a plan for the interview and have several questions to fall back on if the conversation begins to stall.


Keep your questions short and open-ended whenever possible. ""What did you think of that?"" is much better than ""Walk me through your emotions right after you heard the news?""
Never try and lead people to the ""right"" answer. ""You were feeling really sad, weren't you?"" doesn't give your subject any room to tell their side of the story.

, You want them to feel comfortable with you, and you want a ""dry run"" of some of your questions to get a feel for their answers. Unless you are planning a ""gotcha"" interview it is always best to get someone acclimated to the interview process before recording.


Be pleasant and cordial at first, you don't need to jump right into your topic the minute they arrive. Get to know them a bit to make them feel comfortable talking to you. This will make for a more natural interview on camera, and can lead to more candid answers.
Email, call, or meet the person to give them an outline of the documentary before they arrive so they know what to expect and can prepare accordingly.

, A good interviewer actually says very little, instead letting the subject speak their mind. Your job as a documentarian is to expose, illuminate, and call attention to stories that would otherwise fall through the cracks. So let the story tell itself. Don't try and sound smart, force the story in the direction you want it to go, or overpower your subject.


Many documentaries never show the interviewer or director.
Michael Moore, who appears in most of his own documentaries, reportedly has a sign in the editing room labeled, ""When in doubt, cut me out."" He is not the center of his movies, his subject is., Go talk to the ""villains,"" the naysayers, and the opposing sides. Challenge yourself to find people who you or your subject don't agree with and let them talk. You'll be surprised what they can illuminate about your subject, and you never know the reasons for their opposition until you ask.Leave your own personal preferences out of the discussion. Simply begin with ""I'm making a documentary about _______ and I would love your opinion on the subject."" Make them feel comfortable and respected.

, B-Roll is the footage that plays during transitions or between scenes. It is any shot that is not directly displaying ""story"" or an interview. Think of any documentary or Hollywood movie and imagine the shots before someone starts talking, often exploring the location or theme of the movie. You will need many hours of B-roll to put together your final movie. Shoot much more than your think you'll need -- it will come in handy.Leave your camera on before and after the interview, or have a second camera moving around getting interesting shots while you talk.
Try and get B-roll that supports your movie. For example, in the documentary Blackfish the filmmakers use underwater shots of the whales, old SeaWorld commercials, and training videos to give the feel of the park and whales between interviews.
Spend a day or two at every location going out with your camera, shooting everything you can that relates to your subject.
If there is news footage of your subject, call all the local news channels and ask about buying the rights to the footage. Still photos, like those used in Ken Burn's Civil War, can be an effective slide-show underneath a narrator's voice.

, Unless you have a killer budget you aren't going to recreate the feeling of the Vietnam War on camera. You are much better off shooting for something simple and elegant -- one ""soldier"" writing a letter back home, two arguing diplomats, etc. Decorate a small set and keep your costumes simple. Having a ton of okay props and sets doesn't look as good as having 2-3 really nice bits of scenery.


When possible, use actual dialogue from the scene (as recorded in letters, old footage, interviews, etc) instead of writing what you ""think"" they would say.

Watch the movie as you edit it with trusted friends.",How to Make a Documentary3," You never want to lose a great, candid moment just because you lost a hard drive or dripped a camera. As soon as possible, transfer all of your audio and video to a spare hard drive that you do not move or edit off of. This small, inexpensive step can save your 100s of hours if something goes wrong., Non-linear editing is just a fancy way to describe a computer editing program. For longer movies, you will likely need an industry standard editing program, like Avid, Final Cut Pro X, or Adobe Premier Pro. For smaller documentaries, or those just starting out, a simple program like Windows Movie Maker or iMovie should have enough features to get you started.


If you don't know how to use editing software, there are thousands of free tutorials available online.
You can often hire editors online through Craigslist or EntertainmentJobs.com who will work with you to turn your footage into a film.

, Whenever you change locations, a small piece of text giving the location and year is crucial. If you cut to a new interview with someone you need to show their name and title somewhere on the screen, frequently on the bottom right or left corner.

, It is admirable to try and explore big topics and themes. But best way to illustrate something powerful is, paradoxically, though something small. A documentary is non-fiction, but that doesn't mean it shouldn't tell a story. You need to find a story that illuminates the bigger themes and ideas, not try and cram a bunch of ideas at the viewer and hope they stick. Individual stories are always more compelling:


The Academy Award-nominated doc The Square, though exploring the Egyptian Revolution, gains power because it is focused more narrowly on Tahrir Square.

Virunga, though it talks about all the struggles of The Congo, locates itself almost completely in the titular nature park, telling the story of the last mountain gorillas.

Hoop Dreams is a powerful meditation on hope and expectations in high school sports, but it only works because it examines just two basketball families.

, Narrators allow you to get large chunks of information to the audience quickly and efficiently. They can also distract from your subject, over-explain, and simplify your documentary to just one viewpoint. The decision to have a narrator or not is largely artistic. Yet there are definite pros and cons to each.



Narrator: Good narration illuminates subjects quickly and succinctly, still allowing the footage and interviews the majority of the screen time. If your subject has a lot of facts and figures that need explaining, it can be easier to narrate than convince an interviewee to explain everything.

No Narrator: The more common modern approach, this allows the interviews and clips to speak from themselves. The story is more organic, but it can be harder to get cohesive or complicated points across. The ""meaning"" is often more open-ended.

, What was the point, to them? Where was the movie clear, and where did it get confusing? Was it entertaining? Avoid trying to explain things and instead ask their opinions. It is easy to get lost in the movie as you work because you know it better than anyone else. You'll need trusted outside opinions to make sure your documentary tells the story you want it to.


If you hear the same complaints or criticisms over and over, you need to think of ways to address them. Is it an editing issue, or will you need another interview or two?

Plan out a budget.,
Take any insurance into account.,
Know the weight allowance for filming.,
Worst case scenario.",How to Make a Documentary when Travelling2," Filming a documentary can be very expensive, so keep track of your budget and beware that it is hard raising funding and you will unlikely make any money from your film.


Funding. Getting funding is a complicated and time consuming process, it is probably better that you try to get funding when you have done the shoot, as you can attract attention with a trailer.

, Travel insurance usually does not cover film equipment as it has an item limit of £300. So you must take out a separate gadget insurance, make sure this covers your trip as nearly all are limited to 90 days and do not cover your equipment if left unattended. if you are unsure what insurance will cover your equipment you could try photoguard.

, Film equipment can be heavy so make sure you do not exceed hold luggage allowance (usually between 25kg and 30kg). More equipment also means you are more prone to getting robbed. Basic equipment Tape system. Using tapes is cheaper and lighter weight, but can be significantly lower quality (significantly less hassle around insurance).

, What is the worst things that could happen when shooting and plan for these.

"
"
Equipment below.,
If you are filming tape-less add these to your equipment list:


Laptop.,
Use your time efficiently.",How to Make a Documentary when Travelling3,"


Camera. Standard definition, you can pick up good second hand DV camcorders. Good value HD cameras are DSLRs such as the 550d but beware you cannot film handheld.
2nd camera. This is very useful as it means that you can be very efficient with your time as you can capture twice as much footage. So in the long run it will help you keep to schedule and stay calm. If size and weight is an issue you can get excellent small HD cameras such as the Nikon v1, but with less manual features.
Tripod. Do you need one which is light weight or has a fluid head for smooth pans and tilts.
4 spare batteries. Hahnel makes good batteries which are cheaper than the originals.
Tapes. Bring a lot more than you will need bring a dozen.
Lens cloths. Microfiber cloths are good.
External microphone. Getting good sound is crucial and this is best achieved with an external microphone. An excellent affordable recorder is the zoom h1.
Headphones. These are also important to getting good sound. These should be over the ear so they can reduce background noise.
Polarizing filter. Helps protect lens and reduce reflections.
TV cable. So you can log your footage on a bigger screen.

, (Expensive insurance). Consider whether you need a powerful computer which you can edit on such as the Macbook Pro or just a cheap laptop to transfer files.
Voltage stabilizer. This is needed in India.
External hard drive to back footage onto. Consider a lacie rugged. Recently the Solid state drive, a very stable and fast storage system has come onto the market but it is still very expensive.
Memory cards. Bring at least 4 16GB cards.

, Work out what are your priority shots and draw up a schedule for each shooting day. Consider using a second camera when filming as this means you can film twice as much.


Keep a diary. This way you can write how you felt about the shoot, what mistakes you made and what you will do differently next time.

Make sure you are well prepared of any potential power issues.,
Figure out the best lighting positions for the scene.,
No crew.,
Sound issues.,
Coverage.,
Heat/Humidity.,
Backup.,
Return.",How to Make a Documentary when Travelling4," Running out of power when you are filming is all to common a problem that even effects professionals. Reduce the risk of running out of power by keeping at least 4 spare batteries and keeping a charger near to where you are filming (if this is possible). If you are working in a remote area power may be inconsistent, so make sure you have a backup to relying on power. Taking these steps reduces power used by camera:


Use viewfinder instead of LCD (this makes a huge difference).
If its not possible to use viewfinder(DSLR), dim LCD.
Keep batteries warm.
Turn off auto focus.

, A poorly lit subject not only looks amateur, it is also distracting. To make sure you don't underexpose, use a simple tin foil reflector to light the subjects face and at night use a fast lens. if you cannot light the scene it is easier to recover a slightly underexposed shot than an overexposed shot.

, Although there are distinct advantages in being a one man film crew, having others assist you saves both time and a lot of stress, as well as this they can help keep an eye out for your equipment.

, Poor sound is a common problem because it is overlooked, you should have someone assist you by recording sound on an external sound recorder, using headphones to monitor it.

, Make sure you get more than one angle of something, so you have more options when editing. This is most easily achieved by using a second camera. Follow a 30/1 ratio, so if you are making an hour long documentary film 30 hours. It helps to log your footage while you are shooting, so you can see what else you need.

, Heat and humidity can cause problems for your equipment. If you think this will be a problem have a backup camera.

, If you are shooting on tapes this is not a problem just make sure they are stored in a cool safe place. The basic principle of backing is you backup in three different locations.




Computer.
External hard drive. To back footage onto. Consider a lacie rugged. Recently the Solid state drive, a very stable and fast storage system has come onto the market but it is still very expensive.
Online backup. If you are near somewhere with a fast and cheap internet connection, this is a safe way of backing up footage. Beware even with a fast connection it still takes a long time so only back up top priority clips.



, When you start editing your documentary you may realise that you need to return to film more. If you are on a small budget this may be challenging, one way you could deal with this is create a trailer using the material you have and try to get more money through crowd funding.

Study other editors and films.",How to Edit Videos," There are a lot of video editing programs out there, ranging from professional programs with tons of features (Avid, Adobe Premiere, Final Cut Pro) to free programs that come pre-installed on most computers (iMovie, Windows Movie Maker). While free software is becoming more robust every year, you should think about buying a professional program if you plan on doing more than a few home-movies or simple presentations.


Almost all programs have free trials that allow you to test them out before buying.
Currently, Adobe Premiere and Final Cut Pro are considered ""industry standard"" programs. You'll need to know them to become a professional video editor. ;
, While different programs have different features, the basics of most software are pretty similar. Even simple programs have a lot of tools and buttons, but there are three main parts to every video program that you must know:



The Timeline: This is where you order, edit, and trim your footage into the final video. Sometimes known as a ""sequencer"" or ""storyboard editor"" this is where you do the majority of your work. Most programs show both audio and video in the timeline. It is usually near the bottom of your window

The Preview Screen: This is where you watch the draft of your movie while you edit. It usually starts out as a black box with play, rewind, and stop buttons underneath it. It is usually in the upper right quadrant.

The Library/Collection: This is where all of your imported audio, video, and pictures are sorted, allowing you to drag and drop them into your timeline for editing. It usually comes with a search function and some labeling tools. It is usually on the left side of the window. Other sections might include audio controls, a ""toolbox,"" special effects, a place to add titles, and a second video screen to check imported footage.

, Though each program has different names for them, there are only a handful of tools that are mandatory for basic editing. Hover over an icon to see what it is named in your program.



Pointer: Usually a standard mouse click icon, the pointer can do everything from trimming footage to moving and deleting clips to adding sound effects.

Razor/Cut: Usually designated by a straight razor icon, this chops the footage in your timeline into two separate clips wherever you click.

Zoom: Allows you to make closer, more accurate cuts to your video by zooming into the timeline

Rolling Edits: Usually two or three separate tools, these make changes to a clip and then move all other clips to make room for your new change. Ex. If you shorten a clip, it automatically lines up the clips following it with the new length.

, Before starting any project you should tinker with your software and learn as many tools as you can. Import some old footage and make a quick practice video, then browse the internet for free tutorials or tips.


The internet is a fantastic place to learn how to edit, and there are countless videos and tutorials for even highly specific editing questions.
Enroll in a class at a local college or art studio to get detailed instruction if you feel lost.

, Whether you are making a simple home-movie or the next blockbuster, well organized footage is crucial to prevent loss, streamline your editing process, and help other team members jump into the project without confusion. Though it may be a hassle at first, thoroughly labeling and filing your video footage will save countless headaches later on.


Organize folders by project and the date it was shot. Ex. My_Movie_Project_3-22-15
Organize clips by scene and take. Ex. My_Movie_Project_Scene1_Take4
Consider advanced organization software like Adobe Bridge if you are working on large scale projects and need complex labeling and meta-data functions. , Depending on your footage several options will appear here, but standard digital video quality will be 720x480 or 1080x720 (High Definition) at 29.97 frames per second. These settings are called NTSC standard and are used primarily in North America. If you are in doubt, ask the cinematographer or director what settings they shot the video on. If you're still lost, look up your camera's settings on the internet -- it should tell you what sort of video you are editing.
Many modern programs will automatically conform project settings to your footage, eliminating this headache for less experienced editors.

, Though all programs are different, you can usually bring your film clips into the project under File-->Import. This does not make your movie or order your clips, it simply tells the program which videos you will be editing and allows you to access them.


Some programs let you drag and drop footage from another window into your editing window.
Importing footage allows for Non-Linear-Editing (NLE): the process of editing video out of order without changing the original footage. All modern editing is Non-Linear.

, Start building the skeleton of your movie by ordering your clips and choosing which shots you like the most.


You can always drag clips into new spots after you place them, so feel free to experiment.
Start working on a few minutes of the video at a time to prevent becoming overwhelmed.

, Once you have the scenes in order you need to trim the beginning and ends so they line up cohesively. While sometimes this is as easy as eliminating the initial ""Action!"" you'll have to make artistic decisions here too. To splice, find the ""razor"" or cut tool to break the footage up into smaller parts, then delete the parts you don't like from the timeline.


Many programs let you drag the beginnings and ends of clips to shorten or lengthen them.
Never permanently delete any footage-- you never know what will come in handy, even if only for the ""blooper reel!""

, Though these are essential to most movies, they can only be effective once you have the footage completely organized and cut. Most programs have dedicated windows and menus for titles and transitions, and you should play around to see which fit your project.


The most common transitions are ""fade-ins"" and ""fade-outs,"" which is when the image slowly appears or disappears from the screen.
For more complicated special effects, transitions, or animations, editors often rely on separate post-production programs like Adobe After Effects.

, Not all movies need to take this step, but if you want to look professional you'll need to balance audio and video so that the shots all look alike and there are no jarring volume shifts. Luckily, many programs have an ""auto color-correct"" function and ""volume equalizer"" built in.


For a professional looking film you'll need to do this manually, or hire someone who knows how., You may have to repeat this step five, ten, or even fifty times depending on the project, and it will feel tedious. Invite friends, coworkers, or other crew members to watch the project with you and give feedback. Take notes every time you watch it about what you want to fix.


Taking a few days away from the project before watching can help glean new insights.

, The best editors spend less time doing the actual edits than thinking creatively about the edit itself. Print out a list of your program's hotkeys and shortcuts and learn to use them effectively.


Make templates for your favorite effects and titles so you can use them instantly.
Learn how to use Multi-Cam editing, which allows you to easily cut between multiple cameras shooting the same scene. , Editing is the art of telling a story through cuts, or the juxtaposition of one shot before another. You should experiment with different types of cuts and transitions to find what works for your video. No matter what you use, usually the best cuts are the ones that feel seamless.



Hard Cut-- an immediate cut to another angle, usually in the same scene. This is the most common cut in film.

Smash Cut- An abrupt shift to completely different scene.

Jump Cut-- An abrupt cut made within the same scene, often of a slightly different angle.

J-Cut-- When you hear the audio from the next shot before you see the video.

L-Cut-- When you see the video from the next shot before you hear the audio.

Action Cut-- A cut in the middle of an action, like someone opening a door, that ""hides"" the cut in the action. , Though extremely technical, editing video is an art form and your paintbrushes are cuts, colors, and sounds. When you make an edit, ask yourself if that choice supports the creative goals of the movie. Discuss the following with the film's director frequently while you work:



Pacing -- how quickly does the scene need to progress? Comedies are often fast so a lot of jokes can be fit in. Thrillers or dramas, however, tend feel slower to build tension.

Perspective-- do you want to highlight one particular character or many? In Scorsese's classic Goodfellas, for example, every shot concerns or includes the narrator Henry Hill, while movies like The Lord of the Rings often cuts to large group scenes.

Themes-- is there a certain style or idea that the director has in mind? Are there certain lines of dialogue, images, or colors that should be prominently shown every chance you have?

, When the viewer is asked to watch the same image or camera angle for a long period of time, it slows down the scene and give us more time to get into the moment. This is helpful when establishing drama or calling attention to a moment's importance.


One recent example is the editing in 12 Years a Slave, where very long takes gave the viewer a feeling for the slow, difficult years the protagonist endured.

, Comedy and action in particular benefit from rapid-fire editing and very short shots. Cut between every line of dialogue or each action to give a scene urgency, as viewers feel like they are ""along for the ride.""


Moving too quickly through edits can feel frantic, but this may work if the scene is high-pressure or nervous, like in scenes from the sci-fi film Snowpiercer.


, Just like any other creative endeavor, watching and critiquing other artists is essential to becoming a good editor yourself. Study your favorite scenes, TV shows, and movies with an eye towards shot selection, shot length, and frequency of cuts.


Ask yourself why an editor made the decision they made-- how does it help advance the video?
What examples of editing do you like or admire? A good place to start might be recent Oscar winners for Editing or Vimeo's ""Best Of"" videos. When you see something you like, try to emulate it to learn how it was done.

Film a prank or practical joke.,
Record a monologue.,
Make a lip-sync video.,
Capture an adorable family moment.,
Participate in a popular video meme.",How to Make a Viral Video1," No matter where you come from, what language you speak, or how you were raised, there's a good chance that you'll chuckle at a video of someone in a scary mask popping out of a trashcan and scaring his friend. Pranks and practical jokes (especially ones that involve physical humor) have a universal quality because almost anyone, anywhere can enjoy them. On top of this, they're very easy to shoot — a simple cell phone camera will usually do the job.



Examples: ""Extremely Scary Ghost Elevator Prank in Brazil,"" ""Drive Thru Invisible Driver Prank.""

Viral Tip: Use common sense and stay safe when you're shooting your prank. Don't try to shoot anything that could conceivably leave anyone hurt or in jail. See our article on simple pranks for a few ideas to get you started.;
, Simple monologues are some of the easiest viral videos to shoot — all you need is the camera in your computer or laptop and a funny idea to get you started. Most of the most popular viral monologues are funny (sometimes accidentally), so stay away from serious speeches and political diatribes for the best chance of going viral.



Examples: ""Leave Britney Alone""

Viral Tip: The biggest difficulty with monologue videos is that there's not much for your audience to look at besides your face and whatever is right behind you. This means you'll have to be creative to keep your viewers' attention — use humor or an emotional performance to separate yourself from the pack.

, In the age of the viral video, you don't necessarily have to be able to belt like Whitney Houston to become a music sensation. Giving a funny lip sync performance over a catchy song is an easy way to get your video noticed online. If your performance is ridiculously over-the-top, all the better!



Examples: ""Numa Numa Song,"" countless Let It Go lip syncs.

Viral Tip: Remember that you don't have to lip sync for the entire song — a thirty-second lip sync of the funniest part of the song can be hilarious, but a four-minute video of the entire thing can be a little much.

, Don't be afraid to tug at your audience's heartstrings when you're chasing viral success. Cute or heartwarming videos can be immensely popular, and one of the easiest ways to capture pure, undistilled cuteness is to turn the camera on your family. Record something truly adorable (like, for instance, a relative's enthusiastic welcome home after serving a tour of duty abroad) and you will score big with grandmothers everywhere.



Examples: ""Charlie Bit My Finger,"" ""David After Dentist,"" etc.

Viral Tip: If you have young children in your family, you may be sitting on a comedy goldmine. Kids often aren't afraid to act silly, stupid, cute, and earnest the way that adults can be, so keep your camera rolling on any young ones.

, Can't think of a good idea for your viral video? Put your own twist on an idea that's already popular! At any given moment, there are usually at least one or two video memes experiencing popularity on sharing sites like Youtube, so hop on board before the trend grows stale — simply add your own unique charm to the existing formula.



Examples: Countless ""Harlem Shake"" videos, Downfall spoofs, ""Keyboard Cat"" mashups, and many, many more.

Viral Tip: If you want to get popular off of an existing meme, your best bet is to put your video out as soon as possible. The popularity of video memes usually burns bright, but short. For example, the ""Harlem Shake"" video craze of early 2013 peaked in mid-February with millions upon millions of daily views. However, by as early as the start of March, viewership had fallen drastically."

, Believe it or not, some of the biggest viral stars in the world are people who simply record themselves playing video games, then share the footage with their live commentary added in. These types of videos, which are called ""Let's Play"" videos, are a form of entertainment that's rapidly grown in popularity in the last few years, so you'll already have a built-in audience if you're able to put out funny, well-made content.



Examples: YouTube channels like Markiplier, PewDiePie, etc.

Viral Tip: If you gain popularity with a Let's Play channel, convert your viral success into cash! For example, some Let's Play-ers make revenue-sharing deals with advertisers, others get sponsored by established video content providers, and still others use digital payment systems like Patreon to take donations from their viewers., There's no beating a cute animal for working your way into your audience's hearts. Cute animals have an almost universal appeal — there's something about watching a baby puppy take its first steps, for instance, that can warm even the coldest hearts. If you have an adorable pet or you happen to stumble across a heartwarming interaction at the zoo, take your phone out and start recording!



Examples: ""Sneezing Panda,"" ""Otters Holding Hands.""

Viral Tip: Recording a funny or cute animal video often requires a little more luck and patience than it would take to capture a young relative doing something funny, for instance. It's difficult to predict exactly how animals will behave, even when they're well-behaved, so be patient and keep your camera running!

, DIY and ""How-to"" videos are immensely popular online. Though these types of videos may not be as likely to get you the internet super-stardom that funny Let's Plays or meme videos are, they can bring their brand of popularity. For instance, the YouTube channel ""DaveHax,"" which contains short how-to videos for basic crafts, routinely gets hundreds of thousands of views per video (sometimes even several million.)Examples: ""Life Hack"" videos, ""WonderHowTo"" videos, etc.

Viral Tip: For maximum popularity, you'll want to address problems that lots of people have a hard time dealing with. For example, common computer performance issues like slow loading times, bad Wi-Fi connections, and so on are among the very most common customer support issues., It's amazing how quickly pop culture that seems cutting-edge at the time becomes embarrassingly dated. Older music, fashion, TV shows, and so on can be absolutely cringe-inducing with a decade or two of hindsight. Unearthing an old, forgotten gem of retro cheese and uploading it to the internet can be an unorthodox path to viral success, but it's one that can truly pay off if you hit the jackpot — consider how the practice of ""Rickrolling"" became a cultural touchstone based off of a decades-old music video by Rick Astley.



Examples: ""Rickroll"" videos, ""Super Bowl Shuffle"" clips, ""Everything Is Terrible,"" etc.

Viral Tip: Though every decade has its fair share of cheese, for many, the neon-soaked 1980s take the cake. Try watching forgotten 80s junk-cinema classics like Miami Connection for a taste of just how corny the Reagan years seem today.

Make a short film.,
Make a music video.,
Try to break a record.,
Make an animation.",How to Make a Viral Video3," While feature-length movies are typically beyond the time and budget constraints of most viral video producers, shorts offer a more attainable target. There are no rules here. You can go for a dramatic narrative, a simple comedy setup, or even take an experimental approach by stringing together images and textures without a traditional storyline — it's all up to your vision as director.



Examples: Five Second Films, SNL Digital shorts, etc.Viral Tip: Sometimes, the key to achieving viral success with a short film is to make it a really short film. For example, the ""Five Second Films"" YouTube channel, which makes humorous clips that run just five seconds in length, has millions of subscribers.

, These videos are a step above and beyond basic staring-into-the-webcam lipsync videos. Good music videos pair a memorable concept with a catchy song for potent results. Though it's by no means easy to plan, choreograph, and shoot an awesome music video, the results speak for themselves: as of 2014, seven of the eight most-viewed YouTube videos of all time are music videos.Examples: ""Autotune the News"" videos, ""Here it Goes Again"" by OKGO, etc.

Viral Tip: While you don't necessarily have to make a music video for your own original music to go viral, be prepared for difficulties if you make one for someone else's music — song copyright holders are quick to issue takedown notices for content they believe uses their material unfairly.

, People everywhere love seeing amazing feats of strength, intelligence, and creativity. Though you'll have to literally be the best in the world at something to break a world record, if you're willing to pick a very narrow category, it may not be that big of a stretch to break the record, so get creative!



Examples: ""Guinness World Record: Most Shirts Worn at One Time,"" ""Tightest Parallel Park Record Broken,"" etc.

Viral Tip: You don't necessarily have to break a record on your own — records like ""Biggest Sock Hop,"" for instance, recognize community organizing rather than one person's individual skill.

, Viral videos don't necessarily have to be of real people and places. If you're skilled with animation software (like, for instance, Adobe Flash), you can put your skills to use by making cartoons, animated gags, music videos and more. Best of all, animation allows you to depict things that would be impossible to actually shoot with a camera, so you're free to be as creative as you like.



Examples: Potter Puppet Pals, Charlie the Unicorn, etc.

Viral Tip: Don't know how to animate? See our Adobe Flash articles to start learning about one of the most popular animation programs in use today.

Use the best equipment possible.,
Keep the video short.,
Don't limit yourself to YouTube.,
Be positive, uplifting, or inspiring.",How to Make a Viral Video4," Being shot in crystal-clear, high-resolution video as opposed to grainy cellphone footage never hurt a viral video's chances. If you want your video to look as good as possible, be willing to make the investment in professional equipment (or borrow a friend's.) Consider browsing our photography articles for technical information on how to get your shots looking amazing.


You don't necessarily have to break the bank to get great-quality footage. For instance, a good-quality voice recorder and an HD camcorder, which is all you'll need for basic videos, will run you about $500.

, The longer your video is, the greater you'll have to fight to keep your audience's attention. Thus, it's much easier to make a short video go viral than a long one. This isn't just common sense — academic research has found that the majority of videos that go viral are under three minutes in length.Some of the most successful videos ever, like the world-renowned ""Charlie Bit My Finger,"" are much shorter.

, There's no disputing that YouTube is the most popular video-sharing platform in the world (official data from Alexa, an online statistics company, puts YouTube as the third-most-visited site in the world behind Google and Facebook.) However, it's not the only place to upload your videos. Hosting sites like DailyMotion, Vimeo, and more sometimes offer attractive features to video providers. For instance, DailyMotion is sometimes ranked higher in terms of video quality than YouTube.


If you're interested mainly in making very short clips, consider joining Vine, a video sharing app meant for videos up to about six seconds long. Vine has its own active user base, so it's possible to become a viral Vine sensation entirely outside of YouTube (though you'll ultimately be able to reach fewer people.)

, As a very general rule, people like viral videos that make them feel good about themselves and/or the world more than they like pessimistic ones (though there are, of course, plenty of exceptions.) Academic research has found that, while viewers typically prefer content that evokes a strong emotional response, ""happy"" content tends to get shared most of all.A look at the top 10 most-viewed YouTube videos of all time seems to confirm this: the only one that isn't a music video is ""Charlie Bit My Finger,"" which is certainly lighthearted and funny. Of the music videos, about six or seven would generally be classified as lighthearted, depending on your personal tastes."

Determine whether your films are 8mm or Super 8.,
Find a projector designed to project the type of film you have.,
If possible, gently clean your films using rewind spindles and pulling the film slowly through a soft, lint-free cloth dampened with a little film cleaner.

,
Use canned air and an alcohol swab to clean the tape path on the projector.,
Find a piece of bright white paper with no discernible texture to use as a screen.,
Use a camera or camcorder that records to a digital format like DV or Digital 8.,
Place the camcorder on a tripod next to and behind the projector and using zoom and focus, find a position where you can frame up the white rectangle on the screen with as little keystoning as possible.,
Do a manual white balance on the camera with that white light on screen filling your frame and set your manual iris so it is bright without blooming.,
If the projector has a variable speed adjustment, you should be able to tweak out the flicker on this white screen.

,
Load the sturdiest looking film onto the projector.,
With a digital video master, you can now edit or transfer to DVD or VHS.

",How to Transfer 8mm Films to Video," 8mm sprocket holes are larger, perhaps one third of the width of the film, and they are on the edge of the film between two frames. Super 8 films have sprocket holes the size of the head of a pin and the holes are located on the edge but bisecting the middle of each frame.;
, You may discover that you have some reels of 8mm and some reels of Super 8. Some projectors (Dual 8) can handle both kinds. If you don't own a projector, check out your local Goodwill, eBay or vintage camera store. You will likely experience flicker in your transfer unless you can find a variable speed projector. Newer, more expensive projectors might have a special mode for video transfer.

,, Ideally, you will run the film just once and remove any dirt that might scratch the film or blow away any dust bunny that might hop into the frame during transfer.

, Place the projector on the edge of a table projecting perhaps 24 inches (61.0 cm) to your paper screen taped to the wall. Make the projected rectangle as small and sharp as possible. Turn on the projector with no film in it to define that rectangle.

, Newer cameras have better low light capturing properties. Best results will come from a camera that has manual iris and white balance settings.

, If you can hook up a video out of the camera to a monitor, it will make your framing and exposure correction easier.

, A zebra feature on the camcorder set to 100% will help you do this. If the camera does not have these features, the automatic settings may do an adequate job.

,, Start your camera recording first and then start your projector. This first pass is your chance to make any adjustments. If you are very lucky, you could get it on your first try. More than likely, you will have to run this first film two or more passes to optimize the image with your manual controls.

Start with brief screens to display production company information.,
Establish your mood, genre, and main character.,
Introduce your film's central conflict.,
Tease at the film's rising action (without spoiling the plot.),
Spell out the film's central message.,
End the trailer with a particularly memorable line or image.,
Add credits/legal information at the very end.",How to Make a Movie Trailer1," Think back to the last movie trailer you saw &dash; unless it was for an extremely small-budget independent movie, there's a good chance that the first thing you saw in the trailer wasn't footage from the movie itself, but instead a few quick screens showing the logos of the studio that made the film, the production company or distributor, and so on. These images, though brief, are important &dash; the people involved with the film want to receive due credit for the time and money they've spent on it &dash; so don't forget them.

Note, though, that you don't necessarily have to wait until these images have finished displaying to start introducing your audience to your film. In fact, most trailers use the precious seconds spent showing these logos to start playing music that establishes the mood of the trailer (more on this below) and/or playing audio dialog from the film.
Note also that, in rare cases, the standard logos of the studio and/or production company are creatively modified to fit the mood of the trailer. For instance, the original trailer for Office Space (1999) displays the iconic ""gold-text-and-spotlights"" 20th Century Fox logo by having it print from an office Xerox machine.;
, Don't waste any time introducing the basic facts of your movie to your audience. Within about the first ten to thirty seconds of your trailer, your audience should have a rough idea about what kind of film the trailer is for, who the main character is, and what sort of mood the film has (i.e., grim, lighthearted, ironic, etc.) There's no single ""right"" way to do this, but often, trailers do this by showing a quick clip of the main character saying or doing something that clearly establishes the general mood and content of the film.

For example, let's look at the first 20 seconds or so for the trailer for the 2014 film Whiplash starring J.K. Simmons and Miles Teller.
We open with a shot of a New York City street at night. We see Andrew Neyman (Miles Teller), a college-age young man, talking to Nicole (Melissa Benoist), a woman of similar age, in a deli.NICOLE
This place is nice.ANDREW
I really like the music that they play - Bob Ellis on the drums.Nicole laughs, we see the couple's feet touch under the table.ANDREW (Voiceover)
I'm part of Shaffer's top jazz orchestra - it's the best music school in the countryAs Andrew speaks, we see brief clips of him standing outside of his school, then see him practicing drums. As he continues, we see a clip of Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), an older man, walking into a room and hanging up his coat and hat. We cut to Fletcher talking to Andrew as he leans against a wall.FLETCHER
The key is to just relax. Don't worry about the numbers, don't worry about what the other guys are thinking. You're here for a reason. Have fun.We cut to Fletcher cuing his band to start playing.FLETCHER
Ah-five, six, and...




In just twenty seconds, the Whiplash trailer tells us a wealth of information about the movie: that Andrew is the focus of the film, that Andrew is a young musical prodigy, that the film has a romantic component, and that Fletcher has a teacher/mentor relationship with Andrew.





, Once you've established your film's ""status quo,"" introduce its main conflict — the people, things, feelings and events that will form the basis for the story. In other words, show the audience why it should care about the characters and themes you've just introduced it to. Try to answer questions like, ""What dramatic thing happens to set the plot in motion?"", ""How does this make the characters feel?"", and ""How does the main character try to solve the conflict?"" In the words of Jerry Flattum of Scriptmag.com, ""Storytelling is based on conflict. Without conflict there’s no drama. Drama is conflict.""Let's return to the trailer for Whiplash to continue with our example. After the trailer establishes the film's foundation, it quickly reveals its central conflict.
We see Andrew confidently playing drums in a jazz band while Fletcher conducts. Upbeat jazz music plays on the soundtrack.FLETCHER
(Praising Andrew) We got Buddy Rich here!The band resumes playing. Suddenly, Fletcher signals the band to stop.FLETCHER
(To Andrew) Little trouble there. You're rushing. Here we go! (Fletcher cues the band to start playing) Five, six, and...Andrew and the rest of the band resume the song. Without warning, Fletcher hurls a chair at Andrew, who ducks out of the way at the last second.FLETCHER
(Angrily) Were you rushing, or were you dragging?ANDREW
(Meekly) Uh, I don't know.We cut to a closeup of Fletcher leaning over Andrew. Fletcher slaps Andrew hard in his face.FLETCHER
(Furiously) If you deliberately sabotage my band, I will gut you like a pig!Andrew starts to cry.FLETCHER
Oh my dear God. Are you one of those ""single tear"" people? You are a worthless pansy who is now weeping and slobbering all over my drumset like a nine year-old girl!




The Whiplash trailer establishes the film's central conflict to shocking effect. Fletcher, who at first appears to be a normal teacher, is revealed to be a cruel, ruthless, and abusive tormentor. The conflict is clear without the film having to spell it out explicitly: will Andrew, who wants to be a great musician, be able to survive the extreme stress of tutelage under Fletcher?





, After you've established the film's characters and central conflict, you have a little more freedom in how to continue your trailer. Many modern trailers choose to hint at the progression of the plot by showing quick, snappy clips of key lines or events in the film in rough (though usually not exact) order of their appearance. Note, however, that moviegoers may resent trailers that reveal too much about the film's plot, especially if any surprising plot twists are revealed, so be discrete — don't give away too many of the film's surprises!The Whiplash trailer explores the basic plot beats of the movie while revealing surprisingly few specifics. The brief snippets below are taken from the trailer; to keep the length of this article manageable, some snippets have been omitted:
Andrew and his father Jim (Paul Reiser) are shown talking in a dimly-lit kitchen.JIM
So how's it going with studio band?ANDREW
(Subtly ill-at-ease) Good! Yeah, I think he... likes me more now.We cut to a clip of Fletcher screaming at Andrew as he plays drums. No lines are heard; only the grim, driving score plays.


Various short clips play as Fletcher speaks in voiceover: Andrew walks down a dark concrete hallway; Andrew drums furiously onstage, dripping with sweat; Andrew runs through a parking lot with his equipment bag; Andrew punches through a snare drum in a fit of rage while practicing.FLETCHER (Voiceover)
I push people beyond what's expected of them. I believe that is... an absolute necessity.


Andrew and Nicole sit in a restaurant.ANDREW
I want to be one of the greats. And, because I'm doing that, it's going to take up more of my time... and this is why I don't think that we should be together.Nicole looks on, stunned.




These brief clips give us a good idea of how the plot is going to progress in Whiplash without spoiling any big reveals for us. We now know that the stress of drumming under Fletcher is going to gradually creep into Andrew's home life, we know that Fletcher views his harsh teaching philosophy as a way to push young talented musicians to greatness, and we know that Andrew and Nicole will begin to experience romantic tensions as drumming eats up more and more of Andrew's time. We don't know, however, exactly how Andrew's relationships with Nicole and his family members will be affected in the long run. Most crucially, we don't know whether Andrew will truly become ""great"" by the movie's end.





, As your trailer nears the end of its runtime, leave the audience with a strong, lasting impression by acknowledging your film's main theme in an exciting or compelling way. According to A Handbook to Literature by William Flint Thrall et. al., a theme is ""the central or dominating idea in a literary work."" In other words, you'll want to try to show your audience what the film is about — not in terms of plot, but in terms of subtext. What single question or idea is your film trying to relate to the audience? How can you boil the main conflict of your film down to a single memorable line or image?

The ""central"" moment of the Whiplash trailer comes near the end:
Various clips play as Fletcher slowly speaks in voiceover: Andrew sits in a long dorm hallway alone; Andrew leaves a building late at night; Andrew stares with a worried expression in a drab band room. Finally, we join Fletcher and Andrew in a dark room — Fletcher's final lines come from him directly as the score swells.FLETCHER (Partial voiceover)
There are no two words in the English language more harmful than ""good job.""




Here, the trailer hints at the thematic question at the heart of Whiplash: Are Fletcher's cruel methods justified if he is able to produce truly great musicians? If our young, promising musician doesn't have to go through this metaphorical hell, is he somehow less likely to achieve the greatness he longs for? The trailer wisely chooses not to answer these questions — we'll just have to see the movie to find out!





, The last few seconds of your trailer are your chance to give the audience a ""parting shot"" or an enticing hook to make the idea of seeing your movie even more irresistible. You don't necessarily have to be as profound here as you were when you revealed the film's central theme earlier — here, it's often effective to simply end with a witty one-liner, a provocative image, or a few quick shots that are exciting when shown in sequence but don't reveal too much about the film's plot.


Whiplash takes a somewhat unique approach here — rather than ending with a single clip, it ends with a flurry of fast cuts that build in a crescendo of speed and tension. There is no dialogue — just the slow, steady beat of a snare drum that gradually gets faster and faster as the cuts between clips become more and more frequent. The drumming reaches a loud, powerful zenith, then stops suddenly — we are left with a close-up of Andrew at his drum set, sweating, with an implacable look on his face as a single piano cord reverberates on the soundtrack. This crescendo of action leaves us tense, exhilarated, and wanting more, though it reveals no plot details.

, Finally, nearly all movie trailers end with a quick credit page containing information about the film. Usually, this is limited to the studios and production companies behind the film and individuals who played major roles in its production, like the director, executive producer, starring actors, and so on. Minor roles like stagehands, key grips, and so on are usually not included.

Note that, in the United States, the Writer's Guild of America (WGA) has a comprehensive system of rules in place for assigning credits on films that fall under its jurisdiction.Other movie-related guilds and unions, like, for example, the Screen Actors Guild (SAG), have their own similar rules. Major film releases must adhere to these rules — it is not enough to simply display as much information as the creator of the trailer believes to be sufficient. Films and trailers that break these rules may have difficulties being released due to lack of support from these organizations.

Send to film festivals.",How to Make a Low Budget Short Film," You should have a working knowledge of the short film format before you begin, so make sure to take in a short film festival or watch popular short films online.;
, Make sure you have a good story to tell. Before you shoot, write down the complete story including action and dialogue. Make sure your story has original characters and dialogue, avoiding cliches. Try to keep locations and actors to a minimum, as each actor or location may increase your budget. Using only daytime locations will cut down on lighting needs, and using interiors will allow you more control over the set.

, One script page is equal to one minute screen time. With that in mind, keep your short under 30 minutes. Film festivals program in 15 minute segments and they often want to include as many films as possible. Writing a shorter story increases your chance of being selected.

, Using a simple spreadsheet, write down what you plan to spend on equipment, props, transportation, locations, actors, crew, and food.

, Amateur film makers love to work on films. Find amateurs that have equipment you need, such as lights or a camera, and offer them a position on your film. See if there are restaurants that are willing to donate meals to your film production.

, There are numerous websites devoted to funding independent art work. Try filming an interview with yourself discussing the film, or perhaps shooting a short trailer to drum up interest. Remember that spending too long on funding is a form of procrastination.

, Use your friends, coworkers, or classmates as crew as often as possible. One area that you may want to pay special attention to is sound. The sound of your film can make or break the movie, so be willing to donate a slightly larger portion of your budget on sound.


A minimal crew should have a director, cameraman and sound person of course these people will have to do other jobs such as continuity and producing.

, On a calendar work out when your cast and crew can make a shoot, do this several weeks before you film. From your screenplay, make a card for each location and on this card put all the scenes you need to film in that location. From this work out a plan for what you will shoot on each day factoring in:


That a day should be no longer than 10 hours, so its best to start early i.e 9 in morning.
You should do at least two takes for each shot.
It will take time to get to a location so keep filming local.
It will take time to do a lot of camera and lighting set ups.
Weather cover. What will you film if the weather is bad?

, For each shoot and audition create and event on Facebook, or any other social media commonly used by your team. This way it is clear when your shoot is and you can have discussions with cast and crew.

, Doing rehearsals will save time when you are shooting and lead to better performances. Schedule at least two before your shoot and to make these effective write down beforehand what you want to achieve.

, Film on weekends and after business hours to insure your crew will be able to work steadily. Keeping filming combined to two or three days will cut costs in both equipment rentals and meals. Use more than one camera.

, The sound of your film can make or break the movie, so be willing to donate a slightly larger portion of your budget on sound.

, Feed crew and cast well, this is essential to keeping up their moral. You could bring sandwiches, a flask of tea and or coffee, and a flask of soup.

, Make money for post-production by throwing parties, dinners, or other events where you charge cover. Showing clips from your film will continue to drum up interest.

, There is cheap, effective software currently on the market for both Mac and P.C. Purchasing the equipment may be a large initial investment, but it will pay off in time as you learn to edit your own films, rather than paying another editor. Logging, jotting down every take and marking good takes can save you a lot of time.

, If you are interested in entering your film in competitions, be prepared to make DVDS of your film and pay festival entry fees. Before entering, make sure you follow all the terms and conditions required by each festival, and make sure the content of your film is appropriate for the festival.

Consider the different types of soundtrack:

Dialogue.,
Think about sounds before shoot, what can you record on set?

,
Record good sound on set.

,
Keep your volume level even or at the same level.,
Use good quality speakers.,
Keep in mind that headphones will result in a different sound than using speakers will.,
Choose a good editing suite.,
Choose a good sound mixing software such as Pro Tools, Soundtrack Pro, or Cubase.,
Consider the differences between levels, volume and loudness (and even decibels).,
Differentiate between and understand the two main metering types:


Analogue.,
Lock the picture.,
Remember that levels are additive so the more sounds you put in the timeline the higher your levels will be.,
Keep all of your devices synchronized with your DSLR.,
Approach documentaries in a slightly different way than narrative films.,
Use sound to draw attention to an object or person.,
Understand your basic filtering options:


Dissolve/Fade Out.,
Add some reverberation to the soundtrack of the film.,
Use a ""High pass"" setting in your audio to the film.",How to Mix Sound on a Small Budget Film," This should be as clean as possible with little or no background noise.






Sound Effects/Foley. Sound effects like traffic and animal sounds can either be recorded or found in libraries which are used in feature films, though these must be purchased for royalty-free use. Foley effects, such as footsteps and the rustle of clothes, are best recorded yourself using a condenser microphone.






Tempo music. This is music which is used by editors to set a pace but is not used in the final mix.






Atmosphere. This is the background sound to a scene such as in a wood it might be the rustle of trees and birdsong, it is used to give continuity to a scene which may have been filmed in different locations.







,,, You monitor sound through speakers and headphones, using meters as a reference. Use flat equalization and keep the volume the same the whole time you do the mix to ensure a consistent volume no matter how many tracks are being mixed. Make sure to turn off any equalizers, bass boost, or other enhancements that may be available on the monitoring system.;
, Avoid using cheap computer speakers and instead use a high quality stereo and amplifier with the equalizer set to flat.

, The lack of ambient sound, coupled with the extreme stereo field, creates an unrealistic monitoring environment that often doesn't translate to larger systems.


Mixing solely using headphones is usually avoided, but you can use them if you keep in mind that it sounds different from speakers as sound is not bouncing off surfaces, you will hear more distinction between left and right and you may pick up some sounds you don't hear on speakers. You could probably mix 90% of the time with a good pair of headphones, but you will at some point have to hear your mix through speakers.

, The sound editing tools found in Final Cut Pro, Premier and Avid will do basic effects but can't be relied on for anything complex.

, These are your best options as they include advanced features to help in cleaning up sound but it is a steep learning curve.

,


Levels vs volume. Levels and volume differ in that if you turn the volume down your levels still bounce around. Levels are the objective levels of sound at which the audio has been or is being recorded.
Levels vs loudness. Levels and loudness differ with loudness being a measurement of average voltage signal. Low frequencies could appear high on the meters but be barely audible to the hear, having a lower loudness. Likewise compressed sound may not seem high on meters but sound loud to the ear, and is used frequently on narration.
Levels vs Decibels. Numbers on a meter are not decibels; they vary according to the type of meter.

, There are two types of analogue meters (that use needles): a volume unit which can give you a good rough idea and is cheaper but less sensitive, than the peak program meter which provides more accurate readings and needle falls more slowly. Peak on these is between 4 and 5 and is more forgiving taking full volume to make this happen.
Digital. You are more likely to use a digital meter, which is extremely accurate, but beware that digital sound is unforgiving when it comes to clip distortion when the level goes into the red. Digital audio should never exceed 0 dBFS on a digital meter.

, Don't edit the video once you have started mixing the audio.

, Keep levels consistent. This should be roughly around -12dB, but some parts may be slightly quieter.

, With DSLRs more and more people are recording sound separately to the video. You can sync either manually by using a clapper board or using a piece of software such as Plural Eyes or Woo Wave which do it automatically.


Scene by scene. Work on one scene at a time, and work through each element separately.
Atmosphere. Start by laying atmosphere tracks down; these should be continuous throughout.
Prioritize. For each scene work out whether dialogue, special effects or music or sound fx is most important and mix this level first.
Spotting. Go through the scene writing down what other sounds you need to find in a library or record.
Play around. When you have mixed it so it is all at a constant level and feels continuous, you should think of the tonal quality of the sound.. For example the music and dialogue may be a similar pitch so they are clashing.

Note: Don't attempt extreme stereo effects or surround sound unless you are an experienced sound mixer with expensive equipment. It's best to stick with stereo or mono. When mixing keep your music as stereo and atmosphere as stereo but pan the rest so that they are central. If you have two characters talking to each other you could pan one to one side and the other to the other side, but don't go further than 50%.



, Documentaries rely solely on sound in the form of interviews and narration to tell a story. It is very unusual to re-record anything in post so you have to record it well on set and do what you can to sweeten it in post. There may be fewer tracks in a documentary, but do not underestimate how long it takes to mix due to the sound problems you must deal with due to the guerrilla nature of a documentary.

Atmosphere. Ambient sound recorded on set is the first thing you lay down to smooth edits and may help if you are having problems with background sound. If you are clever you can create a sort of soundtrack from the atmosphere tracks.






Narration and interviews. You will want to have these as clean as possible, though you can do a little to improve them. In the worst case of sound that is poorly understood, add subtitles.






Music is a powerful tool in documentaries, but don't over use it. Remember silence can bring great tension.







, You can also use it to show when a character's attention wanders by reducing the level of other voices.

Semi-detached. Sound off screen can create an enigma or cover an effect you couldn't afford to do visually on your budget.






Silence. Remember not to drown your audience out with sound, as silence is just as important and can be useful for tension when there is a sudden sound.







, This is not a filter but is useful to put at the end of a track of audio to avoid pops.
Echo/Reverb. You use this effect if you did not pick it up on location and for psychological effects.

, Ask yourself how long a sound carries on in a location. For example if you clap your hands in a church then outside, the sound will seem to last longer in the church. This filter is used to match sounds you might have gotten from a library or recorded somewhere else to the location.


Equalizer. Think of it as a frequency specific volume controller. You use this to make different frequencies louder or quieter. It can be used to emphasize a voice and balance a recording. For example you may have recorded someone playing a piano but in the recording you mostly pick up the treble notes. Using the equalizer you can bring in more of the bass and mid-range notes. An equalizer can also be used if you just want the bass of the music, such as if the characters are outside a club. Here you would cut (lower) the high frequencies to create a realistic sound.
Compression/Normalization. Dialogue varies in volume so a compressor is used to smooth out the loud bits which makes the dialogue seem closer and more intimate. This effect is used extensively on narration and whispering dialogue. Normalization is more harsh than a compressor and should not be used, unless the audio levels are too low to achieve the proper loudness even with compression.
Notch filter. Notch filters are essentially equalizers set to remove specific problematic frequencies. You can get rid of continuous sounds such as fridge, camera, hum.

, This helps you eliminate rumble and sounds such as unwanted footsteps, traffic and wind. Set it to roughly around 80 Hz.


Expander/noise gate. This filter softens noise below a certain level so as to remove some background sound.
Noise removal. This filter is available in Soundtrack Pro and works by you selecting a quiet part of a clip with bad hiss or background sound then it will work on the whole clip. This filter produces varying results.
Keyframes. Key frames is another way of making sound constant throughout a clip.
Note: It is smart to listen to your sound on a wide range of devices before you master your film to see if any issues crop up.

Use the best equipment possible.,
Storyboard or draw out your trailer.,
Keep your editing snappy (or find someone who can do it for you.),
Choose music and sounds that fit the mood of the trailer.,
Consider adding voiceover or text cards.,
Refine your trailer to about two and a half minutes of footage or less.",How to Make a Movie Trailer2," If all other factors are equal, it's hard to hurt the quality of a trailer by ditching low-quality equipment for top-of the line hardware. Trailers that are shot with crystal-clear, high-quality cameras and microphones and put together with professional-grade editing software will have a much easier time looking and sounding amazing than those shot on a shoestring budget with inferior equipment. While it's certainly possible to create beautiful, effective trailers while working around these types of budget and equipment limitations, this requires extra work and planning.

Note that trailers are usually (but not always) pieced together from footage from the movie, not shot on their own. Thus, to be clear, it's often best to shoot the movie itself with this high-end equipment, rather than reserve this equipment for the trailer alone.

, Planning is absolutely crucial for making a gripping trailer. Even if you're making your trailer entirely from preexisting footage you shot for your movie, it's still very wise to have a shot-for-shot plan before you step into the metaphorical editing room. If you don't have a plan, you may find that your time is wasted: with a feature-length movie's worth of footage to work with and no roadmap to follow, it can be extremely difficult to even get started.

This being said, it's important not to devote yourself too heavily to your storyboard. In the world of cinema, plans are meant to be adjusted on the fly occasionally. You may, for instance, find that certain clips that you thought would play perfectly just don't ""work"" in the greater context of the trailer — in this case, be prepared to adjust your plan to correct these errors and make your trailer as good as possible.
Never created a storyboard before? See our storyboarding article to get started.

, Good trailers have a natural ""rhythm"" that's almost impossible to describe adequately. The images and sounds in the trailer seem to ""flow"" into each other in a logical yet effortless way. Each clip is the perfect length — not so short that it's hard to tell what's going on, but not so long as to be boring or distracting. This requires precise editing and a good ""feel"" for the visual language of film, so if you're not an experienced editor, work with one as you piece the footage for your trailer together.

Because of the time and energy required to carefully edit a movie trailer together, many studios now hire third party companies to do some or all of the work of creating the trailer. If you have the money, consider contacting one of these firms (or an experienced freelancer) about helping you with your trailer. You may find that you even saver money in the long run by reducing the development time of the trailer., Sound (and especially music) can be a big part of what makes a trailer effective. The best trailers use sound and music to magnify the impact of the action on screen and establish the mood of the trailer (thus hinting at the mood of the movie itself.) On the other hand, bad trailers may use sound and music in a way that doesn't complement the action or may make the music the focus of the trailer, rather than the action itself, distracting from the trailer's message.

One example of a great use of sound and music in a movie trailer is in the third official trailer for Nicolas Winding Refn's 2013 crime drama Only God Forgives. While the movie itself was met with middling-to-negative reviews, the trailer is truly memorable.The trailer opens with images of confrontations between criminals, complete with implied violence. These shots are accompanied by a 1980s-inspired, driving, arpeggiated synth line that perfectly fits the retro, neon-drenched aesthetic while conveying a sickening sense of dread. Later, the sound cuts out during slow-motion footage of a gang shooting except for the twinkling, almost childlike keyboard melody of a ballad by Thai indie band P.R.O.U.D. for a truly chilling effect.

, Not every trailer relies solely on footage from the film to relay the basics of plot, setting, characters, and so on — some take a more direct approach by including voiceover narration or text cards to help give context to the footage onscreen. However, this option must be considered carefully — if overused, voiceovers and text cards can distract from the footage itself and lend the trailer a cheap or run-of-the-mill feel. When in doubt, abide by the common sense rule that, in art, it's usually better to show than to tell.

One trailer that uses voiceover work in a restrained way that compliments the trailer itself is the trailer for Paul Thomas Anderson's 2014 adaptation of Thomas Pynchon's Inherent Vice. In the trailer, a coy female voice relays the basic plot of the film in a humorous, deliberately campy fashion that fits the early 70s California setting and the comedic tone of the film. The narration appears only at the beginning and end of the trailer and never distracts from the action. The narrator sleepily delivers sarcastic lines like ""Doc may not be a do-gooder, but he's done good ... good luck, Doc!"" and ends the trailer with the self-aware ""Coming just in time for Christmas.""

, As a general rule, trailers should be no more than a minute or two long. Typically, full-length trailers run about two and a half minutes, though this is not a ""hard and fast rule."" In fact, the National Association of Theater Owners has recently spearheaded an effort to restrict trailers to a strict two-minute runtime.Regardless of the content of your film, try to squeeze all the important beats in the section above into a short, tidy package. Remember — the longer your trailer, the more of a chance your audience will have to get bored with it.

Trailers longer than three minutes are very few and far between. One semi-recent example of this type of long-form trailer is the nearly six-minute ""Extended"" trailer for the Wachoski sibling's 2012 adaptation of David Mitchell's novel Cloud Atlas. Though the longer format does lend itself to the film's complex narrative, which is woven between six different settings and time periods, the creators wisely chose to also release a standard-length version.

Be willing to play with (and ignore) the ""rules"" for making a trailer.,
Participate in the dialogue surrounding trailer-making.,
Learn from the greats.",How to Make a Movie Trailer3," The steps in the sections above should help you create an exciting, effective trailer for most films. However, truly great trailers — those that are remembered for perfecting or re-defining the art form — are often considered classics because their creators were bold enough to disregard established trends in trailer-making. If you're shooting for greatness, stick to your artistic vision — even when it guides you away from conventional trailer techniques.

One great example of a trailer that pushed the boundaries of the art form when it was released decades ago and that has retained its status as one of the greatest trailers of all time (if not the greatest) is the trailer for Ridley Scott's Alien. The trailer is more a disjointed collage of unsettling images from the film than a traditional trailer, but the impression they give is one that's unforgettable. The only bit of guidance the trailer gives the audience is in the now-iconic tagline that appears in the uneasy silence at the end of the trailer: ""In space, no one can hear you scream."" The connection between the images and the film is (ingeniously) left to the audience's imagination.

, Movie trailers as an art form have been written about, dissected, and analyzed a great deal — especially with the dawning of technology that makes such discussion convenient for average people to participate it (like internet forums, blogs, podcasts, and so on.) If you want to distinguish yourself as a creator of great trailers, it's a good idea to become involved in this ongoing worldwide discussion. Below are just a few jumping-off points to get you started — it's up to you to explore as deeply as you'd like.

One good piece of reading to start with is John Long's 9 (Short) Storytelling Tips From A Master Of Movie Trailers, an article written for fastcocreate.com.In the article, Long, who is a co-founder of a trailer production house, discusses the techniques his company uses to create trailers.
Several free podcasts discuss the film-making aspects of modern and classic trailers. Among them are The Trailer Home Podcast, an up-to-date Iowa-based podcast, and Trailerclash, a podcast available through iTunes.Many more can easily be found with a quick search engine query.
Finally, community sites like Reddit usually are home to lively discussions as soon as a new film trailer is released — consider joining one of these communities and stirring the pot!

, Having a hard time finding a concept for your trailer? Seek inspiration from the noteworthy, boundary-pushing trailers that have already been made. As immortalized by the words of Isaac Newton, greatness is achieved by ""standing on the shoulders of giants.""In other words, don't be afraid to reinterpret the ideas of trailer-making masters through your own unique directorial lens. Below is a short list of films regarded as having outstanding trailers — there are many, many more than can be listed here. Note that not all of the movies that followed the trailers below were well-received.


Alien (1979) — discussed above.

Watchmen (2009) — great use of music, atmosphere.

The Social Network (2010) — subtle tension, eerie atmosphere.

Cloverfield (2008) — establishes the non-traditional shooting style of the film, creates an air of mystery.

The Minus Man (1999) — uses a conceptual trick to spark interest in the film. The trailer isn't about the film itself, but, rather, about a fictional couple that has just seen the film and can't stop talking about it.

Sleeper (1973) — noteworthy for its bizarre quality: director Woody Allen talks about his new movie in detached, pretentiously intellectual terms. This discussion is inter-cut with footage of outrageous, silly slapstick comedy from the film.

Make a list of all the instruments you will be recording.,
Determine your budget.,
Consider purchasing a dynamic microphone.,
Augment your microphone collection with a condenser mic.,
Record with each mic you buy before extending your collection.",How to Buy a Studio Mic," Chance are, your home studio will not have to be equipped for any recording situation that could emerge. Therefore, your mic selection should reflect the instruments you will be recording most often. For example, your list might include electric guitars, bass, drums, and vocals. Making this list will help you focus on getting mics that fit your studio's needs.;
, Your budget represents the primary constraint in your microphone purchases. If you are working with a small budget, it is generally best to buy a single good-quality microphone than several cheaper ones meant for different applications. With a larger budget, you can begin buying several different high-quality mics, but make sure your mic budget is scaled to your overall budget. For example, it doesn't make much sense to spend 10 times as much on a microphone as you spent on your audio workstation itself.

, There are 3 types of microphone designs: dynamic, condenser, and ribbon. Of these, dynamic mics are the most durable, the most versatile, and the most affordable. If you can only afford 1 microphone, it should be a dynamic mic. By far the most popular and acclaimed dynamic mic is the Shure SM57; it is incredibly versatile, with a frequency response well-suited to guitars, drums, vocals, and more. It is also very durable, able to withstand physical abuse as well as very high sound pressure levels.


Dynamic mics are self-powered, meaning they do not need phantom power from your preamp. They are known for their flat frequency response, and their only real shortcoming is their low sensitivity.
Even when working with a higher budget, there is nothing better suited to recording electric guitars and snare drums than a good dynamic mic. The Shure SM57 performs admirably in these applications, even with its relatively low price tag.

, After obtaining an all-purpose dynamic mic, you can consider buying a condenser mic to round out your options. Condenser mics require phantom power (a small amount of DC current delivered through the mic cable), so make sure your preamp is capable of that. Condenser mics are less durable and versatile than dynamic mics, but they can deliver excellent sensitivity.


Condenser mics are the best choice for recording vocals. Their excellent sensitivity allows them to capture all the nuances in a performer's singing, even responding to the inflections in the air around the singer's mouth.
Their high level of sensitivity also makes them ideal for acoustic guitars and other quiet instruments where a more intimate sound is desired. They also work well as ""room mics,"" capturing ambient noise and creating very natural reverb.
Condenser mics are available in a wide variety of diaphragm sizes. For a good vocal or acoustic instrument mic, choose a large diaphragm mic.

, You may find that you can get everything you need done with a single dynamic mic, in which case you can reserve your budget for other equipment. As another example, before buying individual mics for each drum in a drum set, try recording the set with dynamic mics on the snare and bass drums, with a single condenser mic mounted overhead. As you expand your collection, try to focus on quality over quantity.

If you’re making a movie that you plan to submit to festivals, you’re going to need to spend some money, even if it’s a micro-budget film. If you’re just making a fun film for you and your friends, you can get away with spending little or no money.


A budget contributes to many factors when making a movie. You can spend money on lighting, sound, equipment, locations, wardrobe, actors, promotions, and more.
Even micro-budget films can be pretty expensive if you’re using professional equipment and a crew. Micro-budget films can reach a cost of nearly $400,000. However, you can still make your own movie for a lot less.Decide on a set amount you can spend. Then create a list on what’s most important to your movie. Maybe you have a camera and don’t need to purchase or rent one. You and your friends might decide that you will star in your movie, and don’t need to pay actors. You or your friends might know how to light a shot, and have some equipment already. This eliminates the need to purchase or rent more.
It’s not hard to make a movie with little to no budget. However, investing some money in the right areas can greatly increase the quality of your movie.Sound and lighting are two aspects to making a movie that can really affect the quality. Proper lighting can counteract a cheaper camera. Sound is one of the most important qualities in a film. If your actors can’t be heard, or there’s too much background noise, the entire movie suffers. Consider investing in lav mics and sound equipment. Lavalier mics are wireless microphones that you clip to your actors to catch a crisper sound.
If you decide that you need to earn some money to make a movie, consider launching a crowdfunding campaign to raise funds.;
, Now that you know what your budget looks like, you can start coming up with an idea for your film. Create a plot that you can realistically shoot on your budget. This means that you may not be able to include a lot of visual effects, like explosions, but you can write a script that works around that. Start developing your plot by thinking about the who, what, when, where, why.


Create a summary of your plot in two sentences. In your first sentence address the protagonist and the conflict. Your second sentence should cover what happens.
For example, your first sentence could be something like: “Danny has been in love with Lisa since freshman year, with senior prom fast approaching, he has one last chance to show Lisa how he feels.” This sentence explains who the main character is, what that character wants, and why it’s important.
Your second sentence could be: “When he learns that almost every other guy in class plans on asking Lisa to prom, Danny enters a race of epic proportions to be the guy Lisa says yes to.” This sentence is like a logline and explains in more depth what will happen during the film.
Next, flesh out the rest of the details. Fill in who the secondary characters are. Where the film is set, and other details.
Divide your plot into three parts or acts. You should have a beginning, middle, and end. With our example film, the beginning could be the spring of senior year. Our character Danny decides he must finally muster the courage to ask Lisa to prom. The middle covers Danny enacting the plan and trying to beat out Lisa’s other suitors. The end is when Danny finally wins and takes Lisa to prom.

, With a well-rounded idea of what your movie is about, and what your budget is, it’s time to write a script. In a film script, about one page of text equals one minute of film. Decide how long you want your movie to be. If you are making a movie for a school project or festival you may have specific time limits. If this is just for fun, you might want to stick to a shorter script to make the movie easier to produce. There are several main aspects to writing a script that will help you produce a great movie.Start with the setup. The first ten percent of your script deals with drawing the viewer into the world of your movie. Establish the characters, the main location, and everyday life. In our example film, this could show our character Danny at school in the hallway or in class. Maybe Danny walks down the hallway talking to Lisa before Lisa gets swept away by some friends. Then Danny’s best friend comes up and the two talk about Danny’s love for Lisa. Moments later in class, the school announcements tell everyone about the upcoming prom. Then we see something that shows the audience how everyone plans to ask Lisa to Prom.
Transition to the new situation. The next fifteen percent of your script deals with how your character reacts to this change in the world. In our example film, Danny decides to get a group of friends together to come up with a plan to ask Lisa to prom.
The change of plans comes next, about twenty-five percent in. Something must happen that causes your character to adapt and change, adopting a new course of action. Since this is a movie, and should be fun, feel free to play with a bit of fantasy here. In our example film, Lisa could decide that whomever comes up with the most creative prom proposal will become the winning date. This causes Danny to have to come up with a new, grander proposal than before.
Progress your script along with events going seemingly well until you reach the halfway point. Then you’ve reached the point of no return. Your character will have to make a choice that resembles a transformation. For example, Danny might confront another boy who is more popular that plans to ask Lisa to prom. Perhaps the other boy humiliates Danny, warning Danny to back off, or steals Danny’s plan. Now Danny must decide if he will retaliate against this new enemy, or focus more on Lisa. Either way, Danny now faces being the laughing stock of the school, and potentially getting beat up by the other boy and his friends.
The next 25 percent of your movie should involve this new goal getting harder and harder to achieve. Perhaps Danny starts doing poorly in school. Coming up with this grand gesture of love has made Danny’s grades suffer. If Danny can’t do better in school, he won’t even be allowed to go to prom.
Continue to escalate the struggles your character faces until the last ten percent of your script. In our example film, Danny could flunk another test that not only means he may not be able to go to prom, but Danny might not even be able to graduate. Perhaps Danny’s friends drop out and stop helping. This could lead to Danny questioning whether all the efforts were even worth it.
When all hope seems lost, you reach the climax. This is the biggest part of your movie where everything comes together. Danny has focused on getting better grades and in doing so has learned something from a class that inspires Danny to come up with the ultimate proposal. Not only does Danny convince his friends to help him again, but he makes a grand gesture that simultaneously exposes the other boy as a bully, and gets Lisa to go to prom with him.
Finally, you come to the aftermath. This is where you explain what happens after the big event. Danny takes Lisa to prom. The two graduate and spend a wonderful summer together.
Depending on the length of your movie. Each section may be several minutes, or one quick scene. If you are making a short film, it’s ok to cut some of the middle parts out.

, With a script in hand, and a budget set, it’s time to get all the people you plan on using to shoot your movie together. Look at the equipment you’re going to use and figure out who is going to operate each piece of equipment.


Do you need someone to man the camera, or will you do it yourself?
If you’ve invested in sound equipment, it’s best to have a person whose sole job is to man the audio equipment.
If you are just making a movie with your friends, then you can easily divide up the different roles amongst yourselves.
It’s important to make sure that you have everyone on board before you actually shoot your movie so it can go as smoothly as possible.

, After you’ve written your script and you know how many characters and people working on the set you’ll have, find a location. You’ll have to make sure that you get permission to film in your chosen location, and that it can fit everyone.


For smaller budget films, or ones you’re just making with your friends, look for locations you know you can use for free first. This could be your friend’s house or yours, your school, or even a park.
If you need to shoot somewhere like at a restaurant or store, this could be trickier to accomplish. You’ll have to get permission from the owner. Additionally places like this will want you to pay them to film.

, Once you have everything set up and are almost ready to film, you need to get some actors. If you are making a movie for school, or fun, you can use your friends. If you want a more professional looking film, consider auditioning actors.


Even if you’re making a film for a school project, consider holding auditions at school. Ask your teacher or the head of the theatre department to let you hold auditions.
When having actors audition, record the auditions so you can view the tapes letter to make a decision. This will also help you see how well the actor plays on camera.
Provide sides for the actors ahead of time. Sides are a few pages of your script that you give your actors to read for the audition. Look for parts of your script that don’t give a lot about the movie away. You want to see the choices the actors make when the subject is vague. The best sides are ones that depict a relationship between two people.

, With everyone on board, you can now make a schedule that works for everyone. Make sure you give yourself enough time to get set up, shoot, and clean up.


Even if you’re making a fun movie and are not on a timeline, a schedule is imperative to keep everything on track. If you are working with a deadline, it’s even more important, as everything from the mood of your cast and crew to your potential budget will be affected.
A big budget film that is working properly can shoot at most six pages of a script per 12 hour day. Chances are you don’t have that luxury, so you have to scale down. Try to shoot two or three pages a day.
If your film is shorter and uses only one or two locations, you can do more. Plan to shoot all of the locations together. In our example film, your locations may include Danny’s house, and the school. Shoot all of the stuff at school at one time, then the house.
Even with a short film, plan to spend a couple of hours shooting each day. You want to have ample time to set up, rehearse, and get a few takes in for each shot.

, Using great equipment can easily get very expensive. But you don’t need to use extremely expensive equipment to make a good film. You can even shoot a great movie on your phone, if you have a newer one with a nice camera.


Having a proper camera is great, and if you have the budget for one, consider renting before buying. Ask people you know if anyone has a camera you can use. If you’re shooting for a school project, see if the school has any equipment. If all else fails and you have newer phone, your phone’s camera may be enough.
Get a tripod for your camera. You need something to stabilize your camera so that your shots don’t look shaky and blurry. There are even extensions for phones to make the lense better and tripods to hook your phone into.
Try to get some kind of audio equipment. A low budget film will be better if the sound is crisp and clear. Consider getting lav mics for your actors, or at least a boom mic to record sound.Use lighting equipment. Like sound, lighting plays an important role. No matter how nice your camera is, if the lighting looks bad, so will your movie. If you don’t have the budget for lamps and other lighting equipment, get a white umbrella that you can use to reflect light and soften hard fluorescent lights. Camera’s don’t view light like our eyes do. Cameras see more contrast, lighting a scene properly can make a shot look more natural to the eye., Keeping to your schedule will help you keep your movie moving forward. A lot can happen when filming and you may have to make adjustments.


Your schedule will help you to focus on getting the right shots and filming the right scenes when you’re supposed to.
A schedule will also help you make sure that you film all of your scenes. You don’t want to start editing your movie and realize you don’t have a scene.

, No matter how big or small your movie is, slating each shot will be a huge help when it comes time to edit. You don’t need a fancy board to slate your shots either, you can simply use paper, or a dry erase board.


Dry erase boards work better than paper because you want to be able to mark which take you are doing.
For each shot, write down at least the scene number, what take your on, and if even what page you’re shooting. This information allows you to easily know what the content is when editing.
You also want to clap so you can sync your video and sound up. By clapping you know where to begin cutting your footage when you’re editing. You’ll be able to hear the clap on both your video file, and your separate audio file.

, When shooting, make sure to get enough takes of each shot. You want to have options to work with when editing.


You might find that when you changed the lighting in one shot, or told the actors to do something different, you got a really good result.
Some directors only do one take, though it’s rare, and you don’t have to get three or four takes for every shot. But be prepared to so you have options.

, Making a movie should be fun. And you should follow your plan as much as possible, but you may find along the way that a new location works better. Your actors may make a joke that you think fits into your movie. Learn to go with the flow.


Being able to improvise will also make the experience for everyone much more enjoyable. No one wants a director or someone who can’t listen to people and make changes.

, Now that you have all of your footage from your camera and your sound recorder, it’s time to put it on your computer. Take the SD cards that have your footage stored and transfer the files over to your computer.


It’s easiest to create a folder that you can title whatever your movie is titled on your desktop. Then, create a folder for video, and one for audio.
If you used your phone to shoot your movie, you can plug your phone into your computer and transfer the files directly. Or if you have a phone with an SD card, remove it from your phone and place it in your computer to transfer the files.

, To edit your film, you need a program that you can load all of your files into. There are paid applications like Adobe Premiere Pro that can do a lot of very advanced editing. However, you computer usually has its own editing software that’s free for you to use.


If you are on a Mac, you can use iMovie to edit your movie.
If you are on a Windows, you can use Movie Maker.
If you have audio files, you have to line those files up with the corresponding shots. This could take some time to get used to doing. It’s best to have all of your video files in place and set before adding sound. Once you have each one paired with the shot, make sure to clip the files together so that if you move one, the other goes with it.

, To help you edit your movie so that it has a continuous flow, follow along with your script. You may think you remember each part and scene, but if you are working with a lot of files you can loose track. Go page by page and find the corresponding scene.


Insert your scenes in chronological order of the events in the movie first. Once you have each scene in place, watch your movie. You may find that one scene you thought worked better later in the film now makes more sense towards the beginning.
Cut out empty space in your scenes. As you progress along, you may find that certain shots or lines of dialogue don’t provide much value. Cut those extra, unneeded parts out to keep the flow your movie engaging.

, Once you’ve edited your movie, get your friends, and other people who worked on it to see the product. Getting another opinion can help you to find parts you could change that you overlooked.


You don’t have to let everyone watch your movie before it’s completely finished, but a trusted second pair eyes can be a big help.
You can also hire an editor, or hand the footage off to one of your friends who is skilled in editing. Another person may be able to work more with color correction and sound mixing to refine your movie more.

, When the editing is finally complete, it’s time to export your film. Think about where you want your film to be seen as this might determine how you export it.


There are a lot of exporting options and file types. Some codecs are of a higher quality than other, and they may also differ from application to application. Think about what device your video will play on, and where.
If you want to put your movie online to Vimeo or Youtube, a good codec (the format your video is encoded in) is H.264. This is a high definition file format that will look great online, and come out as an mp4.If you are exporting your film to burn to DVD, you want to export as H.264 Blu-ray. This will allow you to easily burn your movie to a DVD.
If you plan to submit your movie to festivals you may need to export your movie as a DCP file. However, you typically need another program such as OpenDCP to export your film. This file is really only for professional movie projectors found in theaters.If you plan to watch your movie on your computer or with an HDMI cable, you can choose Quicktime, or AVI outputs.
Export a small sample of your movie before exporting the whole thing to see how it looks and sounds. This will allow you to make any changes on a smaller file before spending hours exporting your whole movie before realizing you have to do it over again.

, If you’re going to release your movie in any way to the public, you want to create buzz. Even if you’re making this movie for a school project, create a social media page on Facebook to promote it and provide information on when and where people can watch it.


Go to Twitter and create a profile or hashtag that you can tweet out with updates.
Create a trailer so people have something to see before you release the whole movie.
If you’re not just making a fun film for you and your friends to enjoy, treat your movie like it’s a Hollywood movie. Hype it up and raise awareness.

, If you’re showing your film somewhere, create a poster for your movie that tells people where and when it’s going to be showing. Make your title prominent, and use an engaging image that shows what the movie might be about.Look at the posters from some of your favorite movies for comparison. These posters can inspire you and give you a template to go off of.
Avoid making your poster too many colors. A few colors like in the title and on the image can draw the eye to the right place. Too many colors can distract.
Consider using artwork instead of a photo. Sometimes an illustration can be more intriguing than a photo.
Get an expert to help you. If you need a poster for something like a festival, then consider hiring someone like a graphic artist to design your poster.

, Whether it’s at school, a festival, or in your home, celebrate the fact that you made a movie. Hold a screening with at least the people that worked on it so you can all enjoy your work.


If you’re at home, get out some snacks and pretend you’re in a large movie theatre by turning down the lights. Try and experience your movie the way you would if it were a Hollywood blockbuster.
After your screening you can ask the people that watched it for thoughts and opinions on the film. Then, if you want to, you can make edits before the final version.

, If you’re proud of your film, upload it to YouTube or Vimeo. You can always keep it private if you don’t want the public to see it.Uploading your movie and promoting it is a great way to build your portfolio and resume if you are trying to get in the business of filmmaking.
If you make a movie you are really proud of and to share or submit to festivals, having it online is an extremely easy way to do so.
If you don’t want to share your video with everyone, keep it private and only hand out the link to people you’re ok with watching it. It may be fun to look back on and watch years later.

Share it.",How to Make a Funny Video," You'll need a camera man, actors, a director, and a writer. The actors should be people familiar with comedy, or people who enjoy having a good laugh.;
, Pass them around and get some feedback from everyone involved. When you think you're satisfied, go ahead and move on to the next step.

, Be inspired by their ideas and scripts. Don't copy, but learn what works and what doesn't, as well as watching carefully for timing.

, Depending on the script, you can use simple places such as your own living room, kitchen, or even a hallway. However, if your script is more detailed and involves a lot of acting, you may want to choose a more scenic venue like a local park, a business part of town, or a spot with a view.

, Everyone who is good with making jokes and writing can get involved in this step. Share the script around for improvements.

, Although the script will be the backbone, actors will inevitably come up with funnier, wittier, and more obvious ways to make the filming funny and you should be prepared to add these into the filming.

, Many of the funniest film scenes result from this.

, If it was funny then, it's likely to be funny now. However, if you have to 'be a part of the group' to understand the joke, then it probably isn't the best one to use. So if you've found something that works, try to adapt it to fit into your script.

, Then it's lights, camera, and.... ACTION! Ensure that there is a good director with a sense of comic timing and the ability to direct actors out of the giggles and dead ends.

, You can use something simple like iMovie or Windows Movie Maker, or you can buy some editing software.


Some things are not funny no matter how they may seem at the time to those in fits of laughter, so be prepared to edit with care and sensitivity to what's funny to the audience.

, If you want your video to be viewed by the public, upload it to a video sharing site like YouTube. Check back often to see what people think!

Whether it be a comedy or tragedy, a farce or a totally serious epic drama, please make sure that the story sticks to it. We don't want a story for revenge being left unfinished because we have the protagonist running off to learn to be the very best, unless of course both story arcs can either be nested or one arc truly ends before another starts.;
, Now that the main story has a foundation, the true writing process can begin. Now if you are not all that creative, then please let your weird friends get first swing at it. Write, edit, re-write, re-edit, repeat as necessary. Some food for thought: ""A good inventor knows that he's created something perfect, not when he can't put anything more on, but when he can't take anything away.""

, Be aware of all of your resources. Don't plan on thin air. If you want green screen, then please make sure you can get a green wall of some sort that is uniform green and the software that can do it. The thing that stings worst is backfire.

, When casting characters, a few skills to look for are:


Able to speak out of synch
Prior training in martial arts
Any training as an actor
The ability to ""go over the top"" (Eccentric)

, Props are what characters hold and use, like swords, combs, and chairs. Toys for props are o.k., however unless you are making a futuristic setting, stay away from colorful plastic toys. Costumes should be with the time and culture, no jeans in feudal China. Make up in filming is totally optional. Cosmetics can help the faces of actors really stand out on cameras.

, Obviously first you need a camera, however be sure that the camera is in capable and trained hands. A microphone that is compatible with the camera along with a boom mic rig (improvised or otherwise) will be invaluable for sound quality. Tripods are a big plus. Lighting is just as important as sound, but any lamp that can cover a large area with a solid light will work.

, Quiet on the set. When filming make sure there is a uniform light (i.e.: Sunny Noon with no clouds, spot lights). Never try to film on uneven land if there is no tripod or true substitute, things will go wrong.Don't be afraid to have multiple takes of the same scene, unless you still use actual tape film. Quiet on the set.

, Here is where the movie is transformed from simple clips into the final piece of work. All clips must be cut into the best way possible then assembled into the correct order.

, Now all that is left is to put it into a tangible video format and enjoy the fruits of labor however they seem fit.

Gather some pets.,
Give them acting names.,
Come up with what the video/series will be about, then write a script.,
If you haven't already, create specific details for the characters in the video.,
Now it's time to think about how the location looks.,
After you have thought about how outside will look, now it's time to define the inside of the house of the main character.,
 You are finally done with the setups needed!,
 Now that everything is prepared, rehearse!,
 It is time to make sure the lighting is just right.,
Finally, you are ready to start recording the video.,
Once you have made enough clips to satisfy your desire to make a video, put it on a computer and edit it!,
Make sure to add background music!,
When it is done, upload it to YouTube!",How to Make Professional Style Littlest Pet Shop Videos," Think hard about this; because if you are making a series, the pets chosen are the ones usually used for the entire series. But don't pressure yourself! Have fun! Try out each pet with his or her character personality, and see if it fits them.;
, If you are a true LPS fan, you will probably already have names for your pets. However, acting names can be very interesting and even allow you to ""gender swap"" where you make a boy act out a girl character/voice, or vice versa. But acting names can be difficult to remember, which brings me to the next step...

, If you want, leave it vague, just listing general events and the addition/subtraction of characters during the story. Or, if your prefer, make a specific script with lines for each character to follow. This is a good method if you forget your mental ""lines"" easily, or if you just aren't good at improvising.

, This includes their personality, last name, likes, dislikes, friends, location, dreams, crushes, history, enemies, family (mostly for main characters), and time (does the story take place in the past, the present, or the future?)  

, Is it a city? You will need at least four or five playsets for this. Is it a countryside or an open area? You will still need some props. Some include  fences, trees, grass (felt or carpet is best), sand (or a light cream/tan floor surface), or uneven terrain. Make it as realistic as possible without it looking too gaudy.

, Use LPS stuff, doll furniture, or similar. Be creative! A play set can be used to show the inside, but it does not always look very neat. Plus, remember your setup; it has to be as close as possible to the original if you decide to take it down for a different scene, or have to move it for other reasons. If you have trouble remembering things, take a picture of the setup and recreate it later when needed

, Now you are ready to define voices, fashion styles, habits, behaviors, etc. This may seem tedious, but it will really help you define the characters as clearly as possible. This is extremely helpful in an ongoing series, but you should at least skim across this step even if just doing a short story or a single video.

, Try out any planned lines and scenes before filming them. It will improve your acting and eliminate slip-ups. Practice how they walk, their tone, their goal, the scene's purpose, etc. Don't spend too long rehearsing, but spend enough time on it to get the general idea down

, Light your scene well, but don't let the glare erase the pets' faces. After that is set, check for background noise and random items in the background of the shot that don't belong there!

, The quality of the camera does not necessarily define the quality of the video, but try to use the best possible camera anyway. Whether it be a regular all-purpose camera, a clunky but good-quality video recorder, or just a phone camera, anything that can record decent video will suffice.

, Special effects are great, but too many can be confusing and make a viewer want to get away from that mess. So use them  sparingly; slow motion, dreamy effects, and black and white are all common, acceptable special effects used in videos nowadays

, It's not required, but it certainly adds awesomeness to a video when placed correctly. Make sure not to use songs with words in them; they will distract from the character dialogue, but these songs are good for some montages, dreams (as long as there is little to no speaking)

, Now all you have to do is sit back, relax, and let people find and watch your awesome video!

Pre Production = The process of getting things together before the making of the film

Post Production = The editing process after the film is complete
Distribution = The process of distributing your movie into theaters or stores;
, A good (and common) program to use to make a screenplay is Microsoft Word (though you could handwrite it, it would be easier to type). People with high budgets often hire a screen writer to do this part, however, if you have no budget, then it would be good for you to come up with the ideas and have your friends help you out. To create a screenplay, first you want to come up with an idea. Let your imagination run free.


Make sure to come up with something interesting that still shows what genre you're displaying.
Create a scene title. An example of a correctly formatted title is: INT. BEDROOM SCENE- EARLY AFTERNOON. ""INT."" means inside, but you can also use ""EXT."" which means outside.
Label the name of your scene. Above, the label was ""Bedroom Scene"". Add a dash and state what time of day it is. If you want to go even further you can also add a time, by adding another dash and a specific time (such as ""INT. BEDROOM SCENE- EARLY AFTERNOON- 1:15"").
Move onto the next line. If your character is performing an action before he/she speaks, type that first.

A good font to type the character's name, actions, and dialogue in is Courier New at 12 pt.


Center what you're typing. Type the character's first and last name.
After you have their name typed in, move down a line and start typing their dialogue, or ""what they're supposed to say"". If they have an action after that, start a new line, un-center what you're typing, and type the action in. Keep typing character actions and dialogue until you change scenes.
Repeat the process of writing scenes until you are finished with your screenplay.
The format for writing scenes is:

Scene Heading
Character Name
Dialogue
Action or Notes for the scene



, That way, you won't have to think about that on the spot.

, You'll want to be as prepared as you can.

, Sometimes people get tired of the project, things go wrong, or it starts out great but soon people start to forget about it. The cast could be exactly as you pictured, but there could still be some that aren't dedicated enough to do as you ask.

,, A few of the angles are:


Wide Shot
Medium Shot
Close Up
Dolly Shot
Aerial Shot
Arc Shot
Dutch Tilt
Long Shot
Deep Focus
For an explanation of the angles, go to: , The cast has to be able to feel what the character is feeling and respond like that particular character would respond. Wardrobe, makeup, and hair may bring out the look of the character but it needs the feelings to get the job done. #* A good exercise for this is to have them act like that character for a day.

,


SFX stands for ""special effects"". Now this is usually the things done ""in camera"" meaning if you, for example, put a prosthetic arm on your cast member and have another person rip it off and have blood splatter everywhere, that's SFX. It can be the easier of the two. VFX is done on the editing software on your computer.

"
Choose a genre to spoof, not one specific movie.,
Watch every movie and scene from the genre you want to spoof, taking notes.,
Aim for the plot holes and start poking fun.,
Invert the expectations and tropes of your film comically.,
Push the ""normal"" of the movie you're parodying to its comical extreme.,
Understand what makes the original so successful, underscoring or arguing its message.,
Consider making an actor or actress the ""straight man"" to illustrate what is a joke and what is being taken at face value.,
Don't rely purely on references to create laughs, instead using them as a jumping off point.",How to Make a Funny Movie Spoof1," With the possible exception of Mel Brook's Space Balls, which took aim almost exclusively at Star Wars, (a mega-hit that almost everyone has seen), almost all great spoofs cast their net widely. It is no mistake that Brook's other films hit bigger targets like monster movies (Young Frankenstein), westerns (Blazing Saddles) and historical epics (History of the World Pt. 1). The master of spoof and parody understood that the more people feel included, and the more people understand broader references, the funnier the film will be.


Movies and genres that tend to take themselves very seriously tend to be the best targets of satire. Generally, the more a movie or genre tries to avoid humor, the riper it is for making fun of.Genre movies are those with similar plots -- any type of movie you've seen 10 versions of, like slasher films, romantic comedies, sports films, etc.;
, A great spoof pays attention to the ""original"" and uses it as the jumping off point for the screenplay, and you need to do your research. Watch both the movies and any other related spoofs, noting what they find humor in and where things are ripe for joking. Some things to pay attention to are:Recurring character types: Is the cast usually a variation on the same 3 characters? If so, you'll need to include parody versions of them, too.

Common cliches and story arcs: Are their plot moments, lines, or shots that every single movie has in common? How can you subvert them to make them funny?

Themes or issues of the genre: What does the movie seem to address? Is it over-the-top action and adrenaline in cop movies (spoofed in The Other Guys), or self-righteous documentaries  (spoofed in the series Documentary Now!"").


, There are few movies without plot holes, and most things you're spoofing will be full of them. Instead of shying away, expose these plot holes to comical extremes, pointing out places the ""original"" film got a little too ahead of itself. Again, remember that broader plots (like how horror movie characters always want to ""split up"") are easier to spoof than one plot point in one specific movie. Most spoofs basically steal the common plot structure from the movie they parody, using this as the framework to make jokes from.


Having the characters acknowledge the issue or problem, or have one character in particular who jokes about the plot hole (like the stoner in House in the Woods).
""Forcing"" the plot on the characters, for example, the character accidentally becomes the classic hero or saves the day, despite trying not to be involved (or not trying at all).
Resolve the plot holes in a ridiculous way (Blazing Saddles does this with great skill), or simply cut to the aftermath of the big moment without explaining how everyone made it through, like Anchorman's quick turnaround on Will Ferrell cleaning up and putting on a fresh suit in under two seconds.

, One of the best examples of this (spoiler alert!) is in the medieval spoof Monty Python and the Holy Grail, where the film ends with King Arthur and his knights getting arrested by modern-day cops in the midst of an enormous battle -- it turns out the whole movie is just adults playing violent dress-up. Surprise is at the root of all comedy, and spoofs are the perfect place for a surprise -- your audience knows what plot point or reveal is expected based on the original movie or genre. Shake it up!


Inverted characters are always a great spoof tactic-- from bumbling ""expert"" cops in The Naked Gun to the intelligent, kickass sidekick in The Green Hornet remake.

, This is Spinal Tap, a parody of rock documentaries, takes this joke almost literally in the infamous ""11"" speech, where a guitarist brags that his amp's volume knobs go all the way up to 11, not just 10 like a normal amp. Spoofs gain humor by exposing how ridiculous the ideas and plots of movies really are, and how far off they are from the real world.

, The greatest parodies, almost without fail, still manage to respect and honor the movies they are spoofing. The do this by remembering what made the movies so special and worth of parody. After all, no one spoofs a movie that no one watched in the first place. This can mean expanding on the themes or the film, like in Sean of the Dead, or simply picking out the most popular elements and playing them up highly, like in Austin Power.Sean of the Dead begins the film with a zombie-like walk to and from work, then repeats the same shot after a zombie infestation occurs. The main character doesn't notice anything different the second time, a comical moment that reinforces the idea that we're all zombies sometimes -- an important theme that plays out up until the very ending.

Austin Powers follows a typical spy plot, but its longevity comes from its recognition of what makes the spy movies so fun -- traveling the globe, crazy fashion and gadgets, and lots of beautiful women.

, In comedy, the straight man is the person who most represents the viewer. They are the only ones who seem to realize how insane or crazy things are around them, which makes the craziness and spoofing around them all the funnier. Think of Simon Pegg's tightly-wound cop in the police parody ""Hot Fuzz,"" or Michael Bluth  in Arrested Development. While a bit of an advanced skill, peppering in the ""voice of reason"" will make all of the ridiculous stuff sound normal by comparison.


The straight man can be a parody as well, and it is usually best when they are -- the main character of Airplane! is a war pilot coming back to face ""calm"" normal life as a civilian pilot. But, if you've seen any disaster movie ever, you know it won't be so easy., A funny spoof needs to be a funny movie all on its own, and constant references to other films will get old fast. Let yourself cut loose and just be funny, even if the joke doesn't have a ""cousin"" in the real movies. Open, original jokes will make the film feel less like a rip-off, or one of those widely-panned spoofs where every joke is simply a reference to things that happen in other movies.


Use your references to add a layer of humor, not to supply all the jokes. Check Austin Powers, for example. Dr. Evil is a great parody of common spy villains, but things like his relationship with his less-evil son transcend parody to become great family comedy in any movie. This makes the son's turn towards evil even funnier later on, as the parody aspects come full circle.
One of the funniest scenes in Will Ferrel's telenovela parody Casa de Mi Padre is a take on the cowboy singalong, but as the musical continues it veers into wildly different, and hilarious, new territory based on the image of them all singing."

Digital camcorders offer the best video quality and options, but cell phones are more convenient and, if you already own a video phone, cheaper. You should also find a tripod for smooth still shots, unless you want the video to be shaky throughout (which is fine in some kinds of videos). There are tripods made for both smartphones and regular digital camcorders. A small digital microphone may be useful for interviews. If you want or need any lighting elements, now is the time to collect those, as well.


Phone tripods tend to be smaller and shorter than camcorder tripods. Find a raised flat surface (like a table) to make them “taller” if needed.






Your camcorder may also come with protective gear, including a cap over the lens to keep it from getting scratched. Be sure to remove the lens cap before filming!





;
, Are you recording a special event, an ordinary day, or something else? Do you want to interview people, have them act naturally, or use them as actors in a play? Think about these and similar questions, and come up with a rough plan to follow. Even something mundane like filming a child playing or a wedding reception can often benefit from a bit of advance planning.


If you're filming a play or scripted scene, you'll need a few more supplies, including costumes, props, and copies of your script. If you're interested in adding cool props without spending a lot of money, check out the YouTube show “Backyard FX” for plenty of interesting and easy-to-follow tutorials.

You'll need a powerful video editor such as Adobe After Effects to create special effects like muzzle flashes and laser beams. The program is pretty expensive, so be forewarned. Physical props, on the other hand, can usually be made cheaply.


If you're filming a family function like a reunion or wedding, make a general plan instead of just filming whatever is in front of you all day. Take key people (like the bride and groom) aside for interviews, or get some shots of the venue and then interview someone about its history. Your finished video can combine all these elements to make a very watchable reel that never gets boring.
If you're just filming things as they happen (as with pets or children), plan to keep filming for a while, and then condense it down to the most interesting parts later. You run a higher chance of capturing something funny or charming this way.

, Check the battery level of your recording device before you begin, and have a charger nearby just in case. Turn it on and off, and adjust all the settings to ensure they're working. Clear away any extra junk (like laundry on the floor) that doesn't need to be in your shots, and be sure the tripod is assembled and working properly. Shoot a little bit of test video and play it back to make sure the color and sound are okay. Check your microphone as well, if you're using one. Finally, prepare lighting: light candles, angle desk lights, or open windows until you get the quality of light you want.

, Make sure that its not too on the edge of your seat or one small fall in climax (the action of it). This will make your audience get bored. Make sure all of the characters in it are distinct. Ease into your topic (For example, if the people are on a date and they get in an argument just sitting down and shouting ""I hate you!"" it won't work out) and make sure it flows., Make sure that the actors have talent. Don't draft them because they're cool or are your friend. If you want them to help, try an off camera job. Make sure to have an understudy in case someone gets sick., Make sure by at least the 5th page that the plot is established., See if some still don't work or it takes too long to film. It's alright to have the cast read off a script., Have it memorized with all your actors including the understudies., Get some shots of the place you'll be filming; these can come in very handy, depending on the type of video you're making, and they can serve as your test footage besides. Area shots can be interspersed to give videos a better sense of place. They can also serve as useful segues between scenes, or give you a chance to add a voice-over or credits sequence.

Shoot your area shots using the tripod, so that they're steady.

, By varying wide, medium, and close-up shots, you can compose a finished video that's more attention-grabbing than the average continuous-shot home video.


Wide-angle, panoramic shots can be done from a tripod to establish place for scene changes in your story, or to give the viewer a sense of the size of an event such as a party or wedding. A wide-angle shot with an acute angle to a road is also perfect for car chases, if you're making that kind of video.






Medium shots are used to show action. Shoot from a moderate distance (or using a moderate zoom) to capture things like playing children, group dances, or people eating at a family reunion. The medium shot is also good for showing sword fights, stunt scenes, and sports plays.






Close-up shots are best used to show emotions and reactions. They're also useful for interviews or dialog between characters. Try to frame people to one side of your close shots rather than right in the center.







, It's fine to film things according to what makes sense at the moment, and then edit your video so that everything flows on the finished product. If you're filming a family event and you want to interview people, for example, you can do short interviews before and after the event, and then cut them into footage of the event itself to create a running narrative. If you've got people in costumes with props, film all your scenes with those items first, and then switch to other pieces and film those scenes afterward. It's easy to reorder parts of your video later, thanks to modern video editing software.

, Once you've got all the footage you're going to get, put it all on your computer so that you can cut out the extra parts, reorder it, and put finishing touches on it. High-quality video takes up a lot of space, so consider using an external hard drive for longer videos.


To get video from your camcorder, either hook the camcorder up to your computer with a cable made especially for that purpose (most new camcorders will come with one already), or record it to optical media (if your camcorder has a built-in DVR) and then transfer the video from your discs to the computer.
To get video from your smartphone, either e-mail it to yourself and then download it from your computer, or hook up the phone to the computer with a cable and transfer the files directly, as you would with a digital camcorder. Note that the e-mail method is prohibitively slow for longer videos.

, To start with, open your raw video file in either Windows Media Maker (Windows users) or iMovie (Mac users). There are other free programs available as well, but these are the two that most computer users are likely to already have installed, and they're both roughly equal in terms of power and usefulness. Go through the timeline of your video and highlight, then delete any segments you know you won't need.


It's best to be rough and approximate at this stage. Only cut out things you're sure you won't use, and don't cut them off too closely to things you probably will use. You can clean up the odds and ends of your clips later.

, Still using rough cuts, separate each “part” of the video into its own chunk, and move them around on the timeline. Use the video preview function on your program to get a sense of how scenes will flow from one to the next.


Spend as much time as you want at this stage. Try everything that crosses your mind, until each of your segments flows smoothly from one to the next (rough video cuts notwithstanding). You may find that some footage isn't as useful as you thought it'd be; it's fine to delete such footage.
Follow a sensible narrative first, and worry about varying shots second. Sometimes you might find that you end up with a lot of one type of shot (wide, medium, or close) in a row. That's fine as long as the video's narrative makes sense that way.

, Zoom into your timeline so that you can edit at very small time intervals, and clip out excess footage on the ends of your segments. Check your work with the preview tool to be sure you've gotten all the excess footage.


You can add simple video transitions between scenes by overlaying them on the timeline, if you want. These include things like horizontal and vertical screen wipes, fade-outs, and text titling. Play around with your program's transition effects library to find some you like, or skip them for a more organic-looking video.

, If you've got some skill, a copy of After Effects (or a similar program), and footage that needs Foley sounds or virtual explosions and gunfire, now is the time to add those elements. You'll have to export the video file and open it in your effects program. Once you're finished adding effects, save the video and open it back up in your basic movie editor again.


This guide doesn't cover any specifics of how to create effects in After Effects or similar programs, but there are a couple of guides elsewhere on wikiHow, including one on how to animate a lightsaber.
Once you've exported your video, it'll open in your movie editor as one continuous file again. If you want to break it back into sections after this point, you'll have to do so manually.

, If you'd like to add music, you can do so by importing music files and dragging them into your timeline's audio track. You can choose to mute the original video track (useful for scene shots), or leave it on and use the music to add emotion to an interview or speech. Finally, add a title card to the beginning of your movie - or title it on top of the opening footage for a more active effect – and add credits, if necessary, to the end.


Once you're done with your video, watch it with the preview tool one more time, and then export it to create a finished video. If you save it rather than exporting it, it'll remain a video project file rather than an actual video.

, Now that you've got a finished video, share it with people. If you're recording a video to distribute to friends or family, use a DVR drive to burn copies of it to DVD discs and mail them to your recipients. To share it with the world at large, you can upload your video to YouTube, Vimeo, or a similar site.


If you're uploading a video, avoid using copyrighted music. Sometimes, record companies get upset about unlicensed use of copyrighted songs and will complain to get your video taken down. You probably won't get into any actual trouble, but it's still frustrating.
You can make your YouTube videos semi-private by only allowing people who have the URL (web address) to access the video, but there's always a chance someone unintended will stumble across it by accident, so keep your content above board.

Decide what you'd like to film, and try to set the recording device accordingly.,
Practice!,
Don't use too much zoom.,
Do use SOME zoom.,
Move around a little.,
Don't always film from standing height.,
Experiment with the camera settings.,
Keep the Camera STILL.,
People aren't the only source of film making opportunity.,
Film doesn't have to be hours and hours long.",How to Make a Home Movie," If it is outdoors, you probably won't have to worry much about lighting unless it is at night. If indoors, you may wish to turn on a light, or turn off lights as the case permits.;
, The best way to learn how to film is by doing it! film everything, even if you just erase it after you see how it looked. Practice indoors and outdoors so that you can adjust the camera accordingly for best picture, clarity, and to make the film look as good as it can.

, This element is true in both still photography and film. zooming in so that the entire face of your subject fills the frame isn't as pleasing to the eye as backing off a little and getting some of the background as well.

, It's a little dull to watch a half hour film taken with absolutely no zooming at all. Zooming in on points of interest makes the film seem more professional and more legitimate.

, Try to position the camera so that it films from a good point of view. (Example; to film a child blowing out birthday candles, instead of getting down and looking at the child at table height looking through the candles and fire, zoom out a little and get the film from a slightly higher height. Bend down, and try to get the same view through the camera that someone sitting at the table at the birthday party would get.)

, There are more home films that were filmed by someone standing straight up holding the camera at eye level. Try something different. If it's several kids, lower the camera to see things from their height.

, In the modern era of color television and photographs, the subtle tones of black and white add a charming effect, and can completely change the way the film presents itself. Sepia offers hues that many have come to associate with old photographs, and can add the charming touch to a film. If your camera doesn't have these features, it's not the end of the world, you can still make great home movies without all the bells and whistles.

, So many home movies are not very good because the person operating the camera moved the camera too much. If any way possible, try to film from a tripod, or if one isn't suitable, maybe you could brace your hands against something that will be outside the frame. The camera doesn't have to be 100% static, but it helps if you can watch the film without having to 'chase' the subject with your eyes.

, Many great films have captured the serenity of a slow moving stream or the activity of a hummingbird drinking at a feeder.

, 15 minutes of good quality film with a good subject and clearly defined plot line (Kevin's 6th birthday party, opening gifts and blowing out candles) is much better than 4 hours of film with 15 minutes of good viewing hidden among the other 3 hours and 45 minutes!

,, If someone is cooking, get a close-up of their hands or the ingredients. If you are in a taxi, get a close-up of the driver or the rear-view mirror.

, Just try to get the camera as close as possible for your shot. When shooting from far away, zoom in and focus your shot before you push the record button.

, Sometimes shoot from down low, up high, or off to the side.

, Listen to your narration and show what you tell.

,, Local music or something that captures the feel of your travel destination is best.

, Follow the ""10 second rule"" of film production: Every 10 seconds should be an ""ah-ha"" or interesting moment. Take out anything that is boring, shaky, or sounds bad. Try to keep your video under 5 minutes for web distribution. If you have a lot of interesting footage and a strong story, you can try a longer format and archive on DVD. However, making a good travel video sometimes means keeping it short. Think of it as a video postcard. Keep the action moving and never let the story drag with long-winded commentary or redundant footage.

Breakdown the visual style of the movies you're spoofing, and shoot it similarly if possible.,
Give your actors characters to reference for their performance.,
Play the ridiculous moments ""straight"" for the funniest results.,
Pay attention to costumes and set design, mimicking the original as much as possible to make it feel like a sequel.,
Toss in visual jokes that mimic or mock the original.,
Allow a little seriousness into the film to make the comedy hit harder.,
Aim for a quick, high-paced film, especially in comedic moments.",How to Make a Funny Movie Spoof2," For example, any spoof of the Blair Witch Project should be using hand-held camera work to replicate the shaky look of the original. Shooting a Game of Thrones parody? You better have lots of low camera angles on the power-players and dramatic, sweeping shots of your location (which can humorously reveal things as you turn the camera).


Not all movies have an easily discernible visual style, but they all have common pieces. While romantic comedies are shot in a straightforward manner, you definitely need a ""happy music"" montage of the couple falling in love.
The other idea is to go as far from the actual movie as possible, shooting instead in a comically different location, like the aforementioned ending of The Holy Grail.


, The best spoofs play off of the original movies from script to stage, and your actors are a key factor. Show them the characters they are spoofing in their ""natural habitat"" so they everyone is on the same page. Find the major motivation or parody of the character (""the pompous hero,"" ""the bumbling sidekick""


Use these characters as baselines, especially for big moments. Instead of starting from scratch on a rakish, sleazy pirate ship captain, you can say ""act like Han Solo, but way creepier and more flirty.""

, Looking at the camera, laughing, or acknowledging that this isn't how things normally are is called ""breaking the 4th wall."" You're basically reminding everyone that they're watching a movie, which can work in small doses (see the film noir spoof Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang for a wonderful example), but most jokes should be told ""straight."" That means your actors accept the lines and events as if they were real life. To your characters, the world they live in is the only world they know, no matter how wacky.


Check Leslie Nielsen, star of famous spoofs from ""Airplane!"" to ""The Naked Gun"" for a masterclass in straight-faced comedy., It may seem counter-intuitive to ape the movie you're making fun of, but this level of detail will make the jokes far funnier. Great spoofs could, at quick glance, be the very movies they are making fun of. This sucks the audience in. The surprise of your twists and jokes are much funnier because they are juxtaposed against a more ""serious"" backdrop.

, The TV show Community's now-famous action movie spoof, ""Modern Warfare,"" had more visual jokes than most full-length spoofs. From the general, such as a trickle of green paint sliding ominously down the wall (spoofing blood) to a character's slow-mo dives, flips, and machine gun fire calling up images of The Matrix and Scarface. An attention to visual humor will wring out a lot of laughs.


Adjust and play with your props. Making a fantasy-spoof? Try changing the emblems on the shields or coat-of-arms to something ridiculous or funny.Don't be afraid to ""steal"" famous shots and do something funny with them. ""Airplane!"" begins with the plane cutting through the clouds set to the music from Jaws, re-creating the shot in a new light., This seems counter-intuitive, but remember the old rule of ""tragedy + time = comedy."" If you put your characters in somewhat legitimate danger, introduce real consequences, and live in the world you're spoofing, then it will be that much funnier when everything blows up in the character's faces. A good spoof still respects and pays attention to the classics, and is a better movie for it.


While any movie in this article could fit this step, Sean of the Dead is a particularly good example. It actually owns up the horror elements in a few key scenes, playing like a traditional zombie movie, which leads to an enormously funny and satisfying payoff in the end., Comedy, in general, is a quick-moving art form, as surprise and speed are key to getting laughs and stringing them together. Spoofs are often even faster because they rarely have original plots that the audience needs to think of. Try to keep the jokes rolling quickly -- if one fails, there is another one right behind it -- and let the plot stay simple.


Most spoofs are on the shorter end, usually 90-100 minutes, as there is always a danger of the movie overstaying its welcome if it doesn't have anything original to say.

Plan a storyline.,
Prepare.,
Start filming.,
Let the action happen.,
Leave the person holding the camera till last.,
Review the footage.,
Start editing.,
Shatter the illusion.,
Choose how to release it.",How to Make a Found Footage Film," There are two types of found footage horror: an investigation film, where two or more people film themselves while investigating something strange and pay the consequences, and an ""accident"" film, where someone is filming themselves and it all goes hideously wrong. The investigation film is much more common, and it gives a reason for there to be an evil thing.;
, Where are you going to film? The best places for found footage are in isolated locations such as a forest (or in a house). Get actors (if you want to do the filming, you must act in it yourself), and tell them the basic storyline and what you're going to be filming that day. Be sure to use a fairly cheap camera because you don't want the quality of the video too high cause it may make it look as if it was from a movie at the same time though you don't want to overdo it.

, Be sure to start by introducing yourselves (unless the characters are hardly seen on screen) and, if you're doing an investigation film, explaining the reason for filming. Then, film yourselves arriving at the location where the action takes place, and walk through it. You may choose to have something scary happening right away, but it is best in an investigation film to let the creepiness build up.

, The characters could scream and start running away from something unseen. This is where the deaths begin to happen. If you're with someone, let them die first (possibly seen on-screen), and if you're with several people, let the one who does the least talking die first.

, Only kill him at the very end.

, If it's bad, start again. If it creeps you out, you've succeeded.

, You could start by adding a piece of text saying, ""I found this footage on a blood-stained camera deep in a forest. While watching the footage, I noticed several strange things that scared me a little. I later found out that I had found the footage of five young filmmakers who disappeared in that area. You are about to watch what they filmed."" Let the audience know that what they're about to watch is genuine footage shot by people before they went missing.

, Before you release it, choose whether or not you are going to tell them the footage is fake. It can often be scarier if people think it's real, but this may attract skeptics. If you do choose to tell them it's genuine, make sure your actors tell no-one about its falseness.

, Youtube is good, or you could convert the footage to an accessible format and email it to your friends, who will be extremely creeped out and may even forward it to their friends.

Lay out exactly what you want and how you want it.,
Create a bio.The bio is what briefly introduces you to the reader and should tell him what he needs to know but also doesn't go too in depth; they'll be left wanting to know more.,
Have good songs for it.,
Arrange the tracks so there is variety.,
Get a box put your demo CD and your bio in it (make it neat) seal it, put the address on, ship it away and hope for the best response.

",How to Make a Demo Tape," You have to plan what songs you are going to put in the demo. Will you create completely new songs? Put together old songs? A little bit of both? You also have to lay out your bio. What will you say? How long will it be?


Make sure to keep the bio short and sweet. Just a brief background of you (where you're from, your age, and what kind of music you perform). You also have to decide if it will be basement recorded or if you are going to pay the money on studio time.;
, Good subjects to have are your age, where you're from, what kind of music you create and how long you have been rapping/singing. Make sure you include your contact information. You can include your phone number just in case but most labels won't have the enthusiasm to call you (unless of course they really like your music). It should be typed out, as it looks more professional than writing that isn't legible.

, This is the most important part in the demo. Whether you record it all new or choose songs from the past, you have to pick songs that have a hard hitting beginning because it is unlikely the listener will keep the same song playing for more than one minute before he hits the 'next' button. You don't want songs that build up to a climax (those songs can be great for albums but not for a demo) you also need your best producer (it doesn't matter if you hate the guy, as long as you can work together and he makes dope beats ask him... If he wants money on the other hand, he better be more than dope) because a good beat ties everything together like a well oiled machine. Just because you want hard hitting beginnings that doesn't mean you must have all club records with a big bass and synthesizers. You can have a hard hitting track with a piano and a drum loop if it's done correctly. Just use various types of music and make it original. 5 to 8 tracks on the demo is a good number because if the listener sees a demo with 20 tracks, they'll throw it in the trash; any more than 8 is too much.

, The listener doesn't want to hear 4 angry songs in a row then a sad song then 2 more angry songs. He wants to have a healthy balance so that's how you should arrange it.

Some of the most creative, memorable music videos in history are simple, shoestring productions.Some are multimillion-dollar affairs.Knowing how much money you have at your disposal beforehand can help ensure you don't go over budget.;
, You don't need anything fancy, digital, or expensive. You want something to gather your thoughts, take down notes, and sketch scenes. Keep pencils and an eraser or two with your notebook and keep these items with you throughout the filming process. Ideas may come to you when you least expect them.

, They may have ideas about how they want their video to look. Some of them will be good. Some might even be great. Some will require a cast of thousands, cutting-edge CGI, and Peter Jackson at the helm. If you have the budget, there's no limit to what you can do, but it's up to you to decide which of the artists' ideas to incorporate in to your video. Have a realistic outlook - know which ideas are feasible, which are unfeasible, and which are just plain bad.


If you happen to be a member of the band whose music you're using, you're in a position with unique benefits and challenges. You'll have firsthand, personal access to the band's creative process. On the other hand, music video making can be stressful. Your personal and creative relationships might be taxed - beware.

, Don't do anything else the first time — just listen. Then, listen to it many, many more times. Listen to it with the artist or band members. Even if you know the song by heart, try to listen to it as if it's the first time. How does it make you feel? Does it make you want to dance, cry, act silly, or head for the bar? Or does it make you feel strange combinations of feelings? Jot down your reactions.


To get the most out of your listening experience, consult our guide on listening to music like a pro.


, Once you have an idea of the song's emotional core, brainstorm ideas for your video. It can be very useful during this process to consult with members of your technical staff - they'll know what's easy to film and what's not so easy.


Music video ideas can be straightforward without being ineffective. For instance, an idea for a country song about meeting people on the road like ""following a man driving down the highway, meeting people in small town grocery stores and gas stations along the way in situation reflecting lyrics"" can work great if well-executed.
Adding small, specific details can make your video memorable or even iconic. The following notes have much more personality than the somewhat vague description above: ""Main character driving a '57 Chevy convertible on long, straight stretch of highway out west; farmer at roadside grocery in verse 1, soldier in Hummer at gas station during verse two, pretty girl in verse 3 (star cameo?) hops in car and rides away with our hero as song plays out. Comedic side-story: huffy business suit embarrassing himself in each scene: squirts mustard on shirt in v1, bumps into hummer with his Porsche or pours gas on expensive shoes at gas station in v2; clumsily putting moves on girl in v3.""
Odd, abstract ideas for music videos can make for great videos. Footage doesn't necessarily have to closely reflect the lyrics - having a contrast between the visual and lyrical content can make for a striking contrast. Some videos are even bizarre or nonsensical.Don't be afraid to confuse or shock viewers if you think it's the best choice for your video. It's a great way to fight The Man.

, Before you start shooting, you'll need to know exactly where you want to shoot. Sometimes the video concept can necessitate traveling to a remote location or building a custom set. For example, our country video may be easy to shoot if we're in Wyoming, but if we're in New York City, we'll have to plan a workaround in advance. Our How to Be a Location Scout guide has tips for amateur scouts.


Talk to the owners or management of any location you want to use. Make sure they are OK with your shooting. If you're lucky, they may also be a perfect fit for a character in your video (if they're willing.)
It's also a good idea to notify neighbors about your shoot beforehand. If you don't, they may be confused or distressed by your shoot. Know local noise ordinances beforehand so you'll be prepared if they complain to the police.

, One of the most effective video-planning tools at your disposal is a storyboard. Storyboards are shot-by-shot sketches of a video that are consulted to direct the video's action. See How to Create a Storyboard for detailed storyboarding advice.


Music videos often employ special cinematic choicesor visual effectsto create a unique experience. If you plan to incorporate either into your video, be sure to incorporate them into your storyboard.
Storyboards don't have to be flashy. They can be as simple as the position of actors and props in each scene, or they can be as detailed as individual cutaways, expressions, direction of movement, etc. If you can't even draw a straight line, don't worry: make a text storyboard. As long as you have an idea of what is going to happen in each shot, and you can communicate that to your crew, you'll be good to go.
Look to break your video into ""scenes"" that match your vision. You can minimize shooting time if you shoot all the footage in a certain location at once (even if it's out of the order it will appear in as a finished video.) Plan your shooting so that you travel as efficiently as possible.

, Depending on the scale of your production, you may be able to rely solely on yourself and your actors, or you may need to create large a crew for the video. Here are some positions you might consider filling based on what work you'll need done:


Director. This will most likely be you. You'll be managing all the different parts of the shoot, from sharing your vision to the cast and crew, to mediating disputes between lighting and sound, to making sure there's gas in the car and that all your locations are cleared for shooting. You're the boss, but you're also responsible for more than anyone else.
Videographer. The videographer will be in charge of capturing the action on one or more cameras. You'll define the shot, but she will actually frame the scene, work with the gaffer to ensure the set is properly lit, and let the sound guy know when the boom is in the scene.
Gaffer. Somebody needs to make sure all the lights are lit, the actors are visible, and everything is right for the shoot. That person is the gaffer.
Sound man. On a movie set, he's the guy sticking mics in everybody's faces. For a video, which often doesn't feature dialog, he'll be the guy cuing up the song so the actors have something to work with. In between pressing ""Stop"" and ""Play"" and ""Rewind,"" he'll be running to get Cokes, pizza, and other sundries.
Grip. This is the lucky soul who gets to move all the wires, all the lights, all the gear, seating, tables, props, and everything else that is brought on set. It's a lot easier to run a shoot when you have somebody to handle those things while you handle the bigger-picture items.
Wardrobe. Depending on the budget, you may simply provide direction to the talent (""wear jeans and a tight shirt,"") or have costumes made to order for the actors. Whichever way you do it, if there are costume changes involved, make sure somebody can coordinate that between scenes, and that your actors have a bit of privacy for changing.
Props. Again, this might be you, but somebody has to find the vehicles used, plus things actors on the set use—mustard bottles that squirt reliably on cue, anything an actor picks up or puts down, or is not part of the location.
Continuity. Unless you are going to shoot from start to finish in one take, there will be need for somebody to make sure that where people start is where they stopped previously. That is what continuity does. They make note of positions, usually with the aid of a camera. They make sure the mustard stain on the suit in the first scene it still there 3 days later for the last scene's shoot. (Or, conversely, that the mustard stain is *not* there if shots prior to the staining are done later.)
Dancers. This part is unnecessary, but if you are a great dancer you can hire back-up dancers.
Choreographer. If you do want dancers and it's in your budget, get a choreographer. They will make sure the dancing is smooth and coordinated.

, Make a list of all the characters in your video. Your video may or may not include footage of the band performing - if it does, you'll be directing their acting, too. If your video tells a story, write down any characters, making notes about what they look like and how they behave. Hold auditions and choose the talent best-suited for each character. For our hypothetical country music video, we would look for actors to play these parts:


The Traveler. He doesn't need to speak, but will need to look cool, confident, and like he belongs driving down a country road in a vintage convertible. Jeans. Shades. Shirt?
The Farmer. Older, weathered from the sun. Old hat, jeans and untucked shirt, friendly smile. Brief camera time, so he doesn't need to be a pro.
The Soldier. Young, tall, muscular, buzzcut, stronger and more confident than the hero, but also more humble.
The Gas Station Attendant. Scrawny? Plump? Greasy mechanic shirt, friendly with a bemused outlook, good at rolling his eyes.
The Suit. Metro, almost handsome but not quite. Slicked hair that is un-slicking in heat. Expensive looking wardrobe, car. Socially and physically awkward, has condescending sneer. Unlikeable on first sight.
The Girl. Strong, independent woman. Confident with her body and therefore beautiful. Brunette. Confident, carefree, tanned, good sense of humour and constant half amused grin. Never upset by The Suit, only amused. Casually objectifies The Traveler.

, Now that you have all your ducks in a row, the actors are well-rehearsed, and your crew is loaded for beer, it's time to prep your set and shoot your video. Pick a scene to shoot. For this example, we'll choose the final scene of our country video. Here, The Suit trips all over himself, the Traveler helps him up, and the Pretty Girl hops in the car with the Traveler.


Put the vehicles and anything else that's in the scene into position, and have the actors stand on their marks.
Set your lighting. As this is an outdoor shoot, if you don't have powered lights you might be able to use a reflector, which is a large piece of white fabric or poster board that reflects the sunlight, softening shadows and brightening a scene. For the most effective way to focus light, use more than one reflector, or even a mirror. Your gaffer will manage this, under your direction, if you have one.
Remember, the main person on screen is always the brightest on screen. When outside, always have the main character's back to the sun except when the sun is in the middle of the sky. This way, the reflectors can illuminate the person's face and front. Although there is a lot to do to get efficient lighting, it is worth it when you want a high quality video.

, You may want to shoot part of your video on a tripod, for static scenes. Jiggly cameras can sometimes distract the viewer from the video itself. Other times you may want to use a handheld Steadi-Cam for more dynamic shots, or a totally free-form ""shaky cam"" for higher energy shots. If you have the people and the budget, shooting a combination of angles and styles will boost creative options in the editing suite.

, If they're in the scene as the camera rolls, have them take their marks. If they come into the scene as it plays, have them at their entrance point.

, Have Sound locate the proper point in the song, and give it a good lead in time so people can ""get in sync"" with the music. Longer is better, at first. If you do multiple takes, you may be able to shorten this part up. When Sound is ready and music playing, he'll shout ""speed!"" (An expression that hearkens back to when recordings on set were done with magnetic tape driven by motors, which took a moment to come up to speed). The sound guy may also want to feed the sound into the video, so there is a reference track for the post editor later.

, Have all your lighting people in position, and all powered lights on.

, The videographer presses the record button, and starts shooting the scene.

, You know the drill here—on ""Action!"", the actors come out and do the scene.

, You may end up with multiple takes, multiple angles, great takes, and awful takes. This is where the fun begins!


Movie making is a complicated, detailed process that can't be completely described in one article. Consult our wide selection of movie making how-to guides for more focused looks at the film making process.

, Generally this is done with USB, Firewire, or proprietary connections. However you do it, you will want to load everything into your computer and store it in one directory.

, Your software editor, that is—whether you're using Sony Vegas, iMovie, Adobe Premiere, Final Cut Pro, or have a deluxe Avid suite, this is where the magic happens.

, Work through the video from beginning to end, looking at all the takes, and finding the best ones.


Use the scratch audio track on the video to match up the cuts with the music, but don't worry much about slight pops or noise on the audio track. This track won't be used for the final video.

, With the track loaded in, check to see how your edits and the music sync up. Unless you're lucky, they'll probably be close, but not perfect. Make minor adjustments to each cut so that everything happens when it should — which will be especially noticeable when you're working with shots of the band playing the song.


If using footage of the band performing, be prepared to cover mistakes. For example, if the guitarist was miming ""Stairway to Heaven"" on the video during a passage where he's simply holding a single note on the recording, cut to another band member, or back to a different scene during that moment.
Use moderation when editing. Tons of short, choppy cuts can be disorienting, while takes that go on go long can start to look fake. It's usually obvious when a cut looks bad - take your time and use your best judgement.

, It was once standard procedure for the song title, artist name, record label, and video director to appear in text at the beginning and end of most videos. Today, some artists choose to leave this information out or take a more ""movie style"" approach to titles and credits. Talk to the cast, crew, and band to see what they feel about your choice.

, Like any art form, music video creation has its ""classics."" These videos have influenced future artists and directors' videos. Know that many of the greatest music videos are great for completely different reasons. Some are visually inventive, some have a razor-shop focus, and others just fit the music perfectly. By understanding what made certain music videos particularly influential, you may have a better perspective for how to make your own unforgettable video.

, Many of the most beloved music videos of all time tell stories that are funny, shocking, tragic, or triumphant. A truly great story stays in the viewer's head for weeks, months, or even years.


Arguably one of the most famous videos of all time, John Landis' video for Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" video tells a classic story.This video also greatly overruns the length of the actual song. It works here, but use caution - too little music and too much video can make for a boring combination.
The video for Radiohead's ""Just"" directed by Jamie Thraves also tells a great story, albeit one with a drastically different tone.This video uses excellently-cast squares and an open-to-interpretation ending to skewer the inanity of white-collar life - a great match for Thom Yorke's spiteful lyrics.

, Music videos are great places to showcase visual innovation and trickery. The video can be an opportunity to employ abstract visuals, unique effects, or animation that visually compliments the song's audio. The visuals don't even have to ""make sense"" in a traditional sense. As long as they're striking and accompany the song well, they can leave a lasting impression.


Steve Barron's video for A-ha's smash hit ""Take on Me"" features a romantic story playing out in a combination of live action and sketchbook-style rotoscope animation.This stylistic choice perfectly matches the song's whimsical, smitten tone and makes for an unforgettable visual style.
The video for The White Stripes' ""Seven Nation Army"" (made by directing duo Alex and Martin) employs visual trickery to give the illusion of one four minute long continuously-zooming shot.Combined with the striking lighting choices, this creates a tremendously disorienting effect that gives the video a great dark atmosphere.
See also: Muse's ""Stockholm Syndrome,""Dire Straits' ""Money for Nothing."", Cultural references are frequently used in music videos - sometimes, the entire video is a loving homage or a scathing lampoon of the material being referenced. With a good sense of humor, the results can be classic. If the artists don't mind a little self-deprecation, all the better - people love musicians who are humble enough to poke fun at themselves.


Hype William's video for 2Pac and Dr. Dre's ""California Love"" is a parody of the Mad Max series of films.The parody serves two purposes - besides being just plain funny, it also suggests that early 1990s California is a lawless, do-or-die playground where only the strongest survive, similar to the post-apocalyptic wasteland depicted in the Mad Max films.
An even funnier parody music video is the video for the Beastie Boys' ""Sabotage,"" directed by Spike Jonze.Having the Beastie Boys portray over-the-top caricatures of gritty 1970s TV cops, Jonze makes an unforgettable, hilarious video that somehow fits the music perfectly.

, It can be entertaining simply to throw as much money as possible at the screen. Shoot in an exotic locale. Plan enormous choreographed dance sequences. Hire supermodels. Great music videos can be pure spectacle, plain and simple.


Hype William's video for Jay Z's ""Big Pimpin'"" is a classic example of music video as spectacle.There's very little in the way of narrative or story - it's mostly just Jay Z and friends having a good time on a massive yacht, partying at a tropical villa, and throwing money to a crowd, all while surrounded by beautiful women. As a display of wealth and braggadocio, it's very effective.
Lady Gaga is another artist famous for her elaborate music videos. Steven Klein's video for her ""Alejandro"" depicts a bizarre, sexually-charged militaristic dystopia, complete with insane (but appropriate) sets and costumes.It's a striking, extravagant production.

, Conversely, many great music videos follow a ""less is more"" philosophy. Minimalist music videos allow the viewer to focus on the action (and its emotional relationship with the music) with no other distractions. A minimal video is also a great choice for directors on a limited budget.


Saam's video for The XX's ""Islands"" uses repetitive shots of a short, tightly-choreographed dance to great effect.By making very subtle changes to the dancer's moves each time the shot repeats, we're able to see hints of a tragic romance unfolding. The gradualness of the change makes the final shot all the more shocking.
OK GO's early videos used imaginative choreography to make instantly memorable viewing experiences on a miniscule budgets. Their video for ""Here it goes again"" (directed by Trish Sie and the band) is great example of a well-done video shot for almost nothing.The video is done in one static shot in an undecorated room, the only props being eight treadmills. Because of the strength of the choreography and the memorability of the concept, the video was a big viral hit when it was released in 2006.

Speak clearly.,
Be alive!,
Transfer for editing.,
Edit on YouTube.,
Make short clips.,
Use simple transitions.,
Add effects and filters.,
Publish your video!",How to Create a Good Video," An 8 megapixel phone camera or better will get the job done well.;
, Find a place find a place with good lighting. Somewhere outside, a room with lots of windows, or a room with good lights. Avoid dark rooms or rooms with a single light source.

, You should probably place the camera at or above shoulder height. If you are filming a stationary video, a good shot typically has the character's shoulders near the middle and their waist or knees at the bottom. ALWAYS do a short test video before recording the content. If you want to get fancy add multiple cameras each recording from different sides.

, If you’re speaking about a subject know what your talking about. If its an actual speech create a script with bullet points. Practice recording to get the hang of being loud and not stuttering. Unless you’re a gifted speaker you’re going to mess up.

, Act like you’re talking to someone. Don’t read of your script, just hit the main points. Don't stare at the camera, or any individual object. Even if you stay facing the camera, shift your weight, use limited hand gestures, speak with more than monotone, and use your face to reinforce your words. If possible add jokes, even if they are corny.

, If it is on a phone, upload it to YouTube. You will need a Google or Gmail account to upload, but it is easy (and free) to sign up. You can make the videos private or public if you want to keep it to yourself or share. If your phone/camera isn't able to, then copy it to your computer and edit it.

, This works best on Google Chrome (browser). Google search “youtube editor”, login, and then you can choose any videos you’ve uploaded. You can learn how to edit from this feature at How to Use YouTube's Video Editor

, Unless there is unbroken dialogue, or a scene that must be all one piece, chop it up. Change your shot every 1-10 seconds. This may sound extreme but is very important. Use this to cut out any errors or content-lacking spots in your video.

, Do not use flipping, rotating, spinning, shattering, melting, zooming, or otherwise obnoxious animations. While they may look cool they will not make your video look cool. The best transitions to use are fading to black (on YouTube choose color fade -> black) or no transitions (also called a hard transition). Also other ones that can be used are; fading to white, cross blur, cross fade, and wipe.

, Judge if your video needs to be brighter or dimmer, rotated, stabilized, or have muted audio for certain clips. If so these options can all be done on the YouTube editor.

, You can choose if everyone can see it, or if only people with a link can see it, or if only you can see it. If you want a copy of your video, choose the “unlisted” option and then use one of the many YouTube downloaders to get in on your computer.

If there is singing in your video, you will want to play the track while filming so the performers can sing along.
You will use the professionally recorded track when editing the video. There is no need to record sound when filming a music video.;
, Each video should tell a short story. Take the imagery and the lyrics and combine them into a story which you will make into a short film. While you want the video to represent the song, it does not need to literally interpret the lyrics. Successful music videos tend to be more conceptual than literal.Listen to the song objectively. You are likely very invested in this song, but take a moment to step back from the work you have done on it already. Listen to the lyrics and the tone and see what images come to mind.
What mood does the song evoke? What are some scenarios you can imagine which would also elicit this same mood?
Where do you see this video taking place? Imagine the setting best matched to the song.

, Who do you want to have in the video? It is possible that you will want the band in the video, but you may also consider treating it more like a film with actors, or even a dance piece. You can combine these elements in different variations.


One of the first cinematic music videos was Michael Jackson’s “Thriller.” Michael Jackson played the lead role along with an ensemble cast. Together they created a miniature horror film.Sia's videos like “Chandelier” and “Elastic Heart” are good examples of videos focusing on dance performance. Sia does not appear in her videos, but hires dancers and choreographers to perform to her music.OKGO has several great examples of videos which feature the band combined with imaginative choreography. The band is often the only performers in these videos, but they sometimes utilize other dancers as well., This is almost like creating a comic strip version of what you want the video to look like. Draw out the entire video in frames to have a true idea of what it is going to look like. This will also help you convey your vision to the camera operator.You don’t have to be an amazing artist, just do your best to draw the general idea. It’s even fine to use stick figures.
Describe the action and camera angle next to each frame of your storyboard.
If there are lyrics in a specific shot, you can write them underneath the frame.

, Once you have a setting in mind, you will need to scout around your area for a place which will match your vision.You could rent a space like a theater, event space, or film studio. Some free options could include public parks, abandoned warehouses, or a public school after hours and on weekends.
You will need permission to shoot any video on private property. Be prepared to explain what you are doing and ask for permission.
Visit the location at the time of day you plan to shoot to assess the light in the area.
Be sure your location has enough power supply for the equipment you will be using.

, Now that you have a concept and a storyboard, you will need to find real people to play the characters in your video. Reach out to friends or put out a casting call.


The performers could be paid actors and dancers, yourself, your friends, or the band.
Try finding actors and dancers at your local college. You can pay them or offer them a copy of the finished product for their reel.
Put an ad in Craigslist or another online site for connecting performers with gigs.

, To really create a quality product, you are going to need some help. Don’t try to do this on your own. The more creative minds and skilled hands you have available, the better.


Hire a camera crew to operate the camera or cameras for the shoot.
Enlist help from artists to decorate the set and create the look you are going for.
If you have dancing in your video, you will want a choreographer to create the dance and train the dancers.
Costume designers will be able to dress the performers to match your vision.
Bring on a hair and makeup artist. This is especially important if you have excessive style needed or theatrical makeup. If the look for the shoot involves everyday hair and makeup, make sure your performers are willing and capable of doing this on their own.

, Plan for more time than you think you will need. Shooting a professional looking music video may take several days, especially if you are shooting at more than one location or have a complex narrative to capture.


Make sure everyone on your cast and in your crew is available at these dates and times. If someone is not available, leave yourself time to find a replacement.
Remember to leave time for setting up and tearing down scenery, hair and makeup, costume changes, and moving camera equipment around for different shots and angles.
If this is an outdoor shoot, or even shot in a room with windows, the time of day will drastically affect the lighting. You may need to shoot for several days around the same time of day in order to have consistent lighting in the video.

, If you really want your music video to look professional, the best thing you can do is hire professionals. The second best thing you could do is use equipment which will make your product look good. At the very least you will need a decent video camera and a tripod to hold the image steady.The PXW-X180 Full HD XDCAM Camcorder and GY-HM650 ProHD Mobile News Camera are equipped with a wifi remote, which allows you to control the camera from an iPad or an iPhone.
Sony PXW-X200 has a fast aperture, which makes it ideal for adjusting to different levels of lighting, including really dim settings.
AG-AC160A AVCCAM HD Handheld Camcorder allows you to shoot in one speed and play back in another to create a slow motion effect.
AG-AC90 AVCCAM Handheld Camcorder is a great handheld camera with built-in image stabilization to keep the shot steady.
FDR-AX100 and HDR-CX900 are very similar except that FDR-AX100 allows you to shoot in 4K Ultra HD. These cameras also have wifi, stabilization, and the ability to shoot in MP4, which is optimal for web usage.

, The location you have chosen may be close to perfect, but you will likely need to dress it up and make some adjustments to get exactly what you are looking for. Set the scene with the imagery from your storyboards.


You may need to furnish your set with the furniture you imagined.
Add elements like flowing cloth, a fire pit, or a nice car in the background to create the mood you are looking for.
You may need to bring in extra lighting to enhance the visuals.

, You want to vary the point of view by using a variety of camera angles. Use the 180 degree rule when switching angles in order to maintain consistency for the viewer.If you have 2 people facing each other, you would imagine an invisible line between the two of them. When switching angles, you can move within a half circle on one side of that line. Never cross this line, or more than 180 degrees. If you cross this line, it will appear as if the two people are facing the same direction rather than facing each other.Eye level is the most relatable and realistic shot you can use.
A high angle, with the camera above the subject, looking down on them, will reduce the power of the subject.
Low angles with the camera looking up at the subject will empower the subject.
Bird’s eye from directly above gives the viewer an all-knowing impression.
Slanted shots, or Dutch tilts, are common in music videos. Instead of the camera being level, it is tilted at an angle to the horizon for an off-kilter, dramatic effect.

, You don’t want to just leave the camera in one place when you film your video. If you are always shooting from a distance, you will not be able to see the faces, emotions and reactions of the characters in your video. If you are too close, you won’t get the whole picture. Some examples of different shot types are:Close ups have a feature of the character or object you are filming take up most of the screen and are good for detail work.
Wide shots show the character or object in its entirety on the screen.
Over the shoulder shots allow the viewer to experience the point of view of one of the characters because the camera is shooting over the shoulder of that character with the other person or object in their view. Seeing a little of the other character’s shoulder still gives the perspective of that person.
A cut away is used to move away from the main characters or objects and shoots something other than the subject, like the scenery or background.

, Once you have filmed everything from one angle, move the camera to another angle and do it again. Film several takes from each angle so that you have plenty to choose from when you move on to editing.


This will ensure that you have everything you need. You will be able to choose the best takes in editing.
Having a lot of ""B-roll"" or extra footage will allow you to make more changes in the shots and angles to create variety in the video., There are several options available to the everyday user. Some of them are free and others can be costly. Consider your options and your budget. Test out any software which may already be included on your computer. There are several options for user-friendly editing software:Final Cut Pro is often considered the best video editing software for a Mac. It has been used to complete high-profile, feature films and is common among independent filmmakers. It costs around $300.
A cheaper and user friendly version for a Mac is iMovie, which is only $14.99.
A good option for Windows users is the Sony Vegas Movie Studio with features including text, transitions and effects. It is a more affordable option at $49.

, Do not use any sound from the filming of the video. You want the professional recorded version to sync with the video footage.


If there is singing in your video, take the time to make sure that the visual of the singer is synced to the recording of the song.

, Edit together the different shots and angles you have used in filming to create a dynamic video. Match the cuts and shots with the changes in the song, including the change in rhythm or key, or the action of the story.If there is a large crescendo in the song, maybe you match that with a long shot which zooms into a closeup. If there is an abrupt change in the beat, you can cut quickly to a new shot.
Music videos often use a “jump cut,” which abruptly cuts from one shot to another. This could be a shot with a lot of action immediately switching to the stillness of the artist singing into the camera.

, You want the video to look consistent in it’s coloring. This final polish will give it a really professional look.Some of the shots may be dimmer than others and need to be brightened, while others may be over exposed.
You can also change the tone of the video by changing the tone of the colors. Red are warmer tones, while blues are cooler. Also, darkening the image can make the mood more ominous.

, When you think you are finished, you are not actually finished. Watch the entire video again and be critical as a viewer. Recall your original concept and look back at your storyboards. Ensure that the video is telling the story you meant it to tell and is conveying the tone you originally imagined.


Make notes of anything which seems inconsistent, or any moments which lost your interest and could be corrected.
Go back and make these final edits.

, It's always good to go in with a plan. That way, you know what you're doing, and don't end up taking way longer than you meant to, or end up with a beginning and an ending, but nothing to tie them together.

, Basically, divide the screen into thirds (like a tic-tac-toe board). The focus of the shot should be at an intersection of those lines, or at least as close as it can be within reason. When shooting people, it's the eyes. Remember to leave ample headroom, meaning don't cut off the top of their heads. Also, leave look-space. If someone is looking even slightly to one side, you shouldn't cut off that side. You should have the people on the opposite side of the middle of the shot than where they're looking.

, Get as many shots as you can from as many directions as possible. This is called coverage, and it makes your film more visually interesting.

, You can't cut your unintelligible mother-in-law out of a birthday party scene by saying, ""The running time is a bit long."" Instead, dub music over her. Set anyone to the right song and they come off looking great.

, No one wants to watch a two-hour video of your vacation. But you can dazzle viewers with five Michael Bay, cut-heavy, chopped-up minutes.

, Indoor shoots have big problems with backlighting and shadows, so film outside as much as possible.

, They're easy to use , and can improve your home-movie enormously! Remember though , some tripods can be stiff , and sometimes it's just better to use the camera hand-held!

, You're not making a real documentary here. If someone stutters or slurs, ask them to say it again. This is especially helpful with kids.

, Try a nice shotgun model that you can mount on the camcorder. This way, you won't have to rely so much on music.

, Don't take this literally , all too often , the only way you can feature people in your film is to work with your mates , but as you know , giddiness and messing can happen easily when your friends are around. If you want to get your film done , keep it serious!

, try to keep it under 5 characters to make it easier. If not, that's okay too! Write their personality and background. And if your Artistic, draw them out, along with what they wear (costumes).

, If you are doing this alone, try testing different voices you can do. Go along with the story line, and have scenes. EX: Scene 1; Nina's home. Scene 2; The farm, etc. Then, write what you envision the characters saying and write what they're doing. EX: Scene 1; Nina's home. Nina: Mother, I'm done my chores. May I go sing outside? *Mother is cooking* Mother: Yes, Dear, etc. Have this going for every scene.

, Read it again and again to see if it makes any sense.  Try timing how long it takes to read with a timer. Take an occasional pause at parts where the characters have a big choice to make, etc.

, If not, skip to step 6. Maybe you don't know how to edit, And your best buddy Jim does. Have Jim help sort out the short. Also, maybe your friends Bob, Lois, and Sam want to act in this movie. Danny wants to make the costumes, and Cindy will record the short.

, Maybe she has a dress on because its so warm in Africa. Maybe you need to wear a parka because your character lives at the North Pole. Try to relate you costume with the weather.

, Don't just step in front of the camera with your script! Try to memorize the most part of your script. Make sure you are saying your sentences in the right tone of voice, and make sure your costume will stay on if you do some sort of dance.

, If you don't have one, make your own. if your filming in the hallway, put the camera on a chair, or even the closet shelf.  A good angle for a running scene its to turn the tripod upside down with the camera on it, and point it at whomever is running.

, Windows Movie maker is fine  if you're just a starters at editing, But if your more advanced, try Imovie, or even Adobe Premiere Pro or After Effects!

, Did you want to grayscale that clip, or flip it around? Editing takes a huge amount of patience. If you were talking in one clip and can't hear yourself, turn the volume on the clip up. Depending on how you want it, you can accomplish almost anything on the higher advanced software.

, Have the movie complete, and have the narrator record his voice as he watches the movie. Most computers now have a built in microphone, but if not, webcams work fine, and you can purchase microphones at your local Walmart or Target.

, MP4 is one of the most popular formats for video. AVI is another. Do some research on what file does what, because Youtube only allows some formats. Burn some discs to give to friends, e-mail your movie, Put it on Youtube, or anything. Now you can look back and say ""I made a short film.""!

Sometimes it can be great fun mixing genres together: for example, any comedy blending elements of a well-defined and more serious genre can add uproarious humor to your idea. Be creative!;
, Are you serious about creating a ""large scale"" home movie? Are you just looking to experiment and have fun? Especially when working with others, be keen on maintaining your desired atmosphere and don't let too much over-analyzing dry up your good time flick - or too much horseplay ruin your drama.

, Most of us are eager to give our friends top billing in our films, so cast them accordingly. For instance, if your main character is a tough, masculine type, it would only make sense to cast a friend you regard as rugged and strong into that role. Character's roles don't always have to go to the person with the most similar personality, however. Your pleasant, even-tempered party buddy might surprise you and conjure up a nasty, barbaric alter-ego and make the perfect cold-blooded villain for your feature. Some roles, particularly leading roles, should be experimented with!

, Improvisation is manageable too, but a decent idea of each scene is important in order to make this work. Don't allow your movie to meander and lose its focus due to poor improvisation. Editing is also a great method in ensuring a tight ensemble at all times.

, Sometimes this depends on the scope of your movie. But don't be fooled, a tight budget doesn't necessarily have to restrict the quality of your film. Discover creative alternatives to otherwise too-pricey scenes and let clever camera angles, smart dialogue and the power of suggestion take over where your special effects are limited.

, Learn your equipment. Know how to use your cameras, microphones, editing software and anything else you'll be using to create and hone your film.

, Multiple camera angles and unique shots maintain interest and accelerate your plot. Also be aware of tried and true cinematic effects such as wide establishing shots, close-ups and action scenes. Some are tricky, but with a level head and a keen understanding of the vision you want to bring to the screen, you can always make magic happen.

, Say you want to create a high-speed car chase, but the idea just looks too difficult to pull off. Don't sweat it! This is where good camera work and the power of suggestion is put to the test. In the scenario of a car chase sequence, alternate between close-ups of the drivers and their actions and a large array of vehicle visuals. When filming the actual chase, distance shots are probably easiest, but use different methods to get in close and if you splice these shots together tastefully during editing, you will likely be surprised at how authentic your chase looks! A good soundtrack always helps immensely, and timing your music to match high points in your movie can boost excitement.

, Don't have the right effect plugins for your video editor to bring that epic gunfight to life? Toy with the options you DO have: add your own ""custom"" muzzle flashes step-by-step in Paint and inject the improved graphics between their respective in-motion at a one half second speed, or dub text boxes with transparent white or orange asterisks over the gun barrels and modify the duration to the length of the gunshot. Sometimes a corny idea works good enough that in moderation it can add a nice touch where there otherwise wouldn't be one. Explore all possibilities.

, Get the most out of your actors. Most of us enjoy acting in character, and good costumes, props and settings will only enhance our acting abilities! Just remember, for all the good stories and editing in the world, terrible acting will kill any movie!

, Some romantic tension or a clever twist will always delight your audience and impress them with your multi-dimensional storytelling.

, A legitimate movie title and opening credits can establish instant credibility to your movie, especially when coupled with a suitable soundtrack!

, Websites like http:\\www.freeaudionetwork.com have hundreds of amazing musical selections to choose from, and a wealth of sound effects can be bought on CD or found on the Internet.

, Save your movie with a high resolution and burn it to DVD so you, your friends and family can enjoy it for decades to come! You never know, this could even be the original film that gets you recognized!

Get a computer with access to the internet and a camera.,
Pick a song.,
Plan your shot(s).,
Rehearse!,
Make sure your shooting area is well-lit!,
Get in position, turn on the music, and press ""record."",
Review your take(s) on your computer.",How to Make a Music Video with a Web Cam," Many computers have cameras built into the monitor or body of the computer. Know how to operate your camera before beginning. Besides a location for shooting, this is all you'll need. The benefit of shooting from a computer is in its convenience - you won't have to use any technical equipment and you'll be able to edit the video and upload it to sharing sites on the same computer you shoot it on.


One of the best things about making a music video is sharing it! Videos you make on your computer are especially easy to share to streaming video sites. They're also a good way to get noticed - amateur music videos are among some of the most popular viral videos of all-time. However, if you don't want to share your video online, you won't need an internet connection.





;
, The instructions in this section assume that you have either recorded your own song previously or have permission to use someone else's. You should pick a song that you know well - forgetting the parts of a song while you're shooting can mean time is wasted re-shooting.


Getting the legal right to use someone else's music can be a tricky process (see: How to Buy Music Rights.) If you don't want your music video removed, seek permission before uploading it.






You don't necessarily need to use an entire song for your music video. Some of the most successful viral videos ever use only a short selection of a larger song., The simplest option for recording a webcam music video is to simply use one uninterrupted shot of the area where you normally use your computer. For more ambitious videos, you may want to take many separate shots, then edit them together into one seamless whole. In either case, plan ahead. Write an outline or some basic stage directions beforehand. If you or any cast members forget what to do, you'll be able to consult your instructions.


For videos with a narrative, write a script (see: How to Write a Script.)






Most webcam videos aren't complicated - some of the most famous webcam music videos ever are nothing more than one person sitting in front of his or her computer and lip-syncing to a short clip from the song.Don't let this keep you from being creative - a more memorable video has a better chance of taking off!







, Even if you've planned a simple video, walk through it a few times. You may be surprised by stumbling blocks that you hadn't anticipated - for instance, you might a get a case of the giggles or have a hard time keeping on beat with the music.


If your on-screen action is meant to be synchronized in time with the song, play the song while you're filming. For this, it can be handy to keep a boombox or a set of speakers off-camera.






If you've got the hard drive space, leave the camera on for your rehearsals. You may surprise yourself by nailing it on the first try! Even better, you may capture a happy accident that you hadn't planned for. Sometimes this can give you better footage than you would have gotten if everything had gone ""right."", Webcams usually have worse picture quality than conventional cameras as-is - don't worsen things with bad lighting. You don't need anything fancy, just a few 100W bulbs. The less the camera has to compensate for low light, the better your videos will look.


Sometimes a well-done low-light look can give a music video a dark or mysterious atmosphere. If you're going to incorporate darkness into your video, have at least one light source - your audience needs to be able to see something.







, The rest is up to you - be confident and show the world you know how to rock out!


If you have time, record multiple takes. Experiment with different angles and performance styles. You might discover that making subtle changes to your performance or camera can give your video tremendous personality.







, Try to pick your best, most entertaining performance. If your video uses multiple takes, edit these takes together in a video-editing program. A variety of paid and free options are available for your editing needs (see: How to Edit Videos for YouTube.) When you have footage that you love, upload your work to a video streaming site (see: How to Upload a Video to YouTube), then share your link with your fans!

Once you have recorded your single it is time to pre-produce your video.,
Take the vision and begin to break it down into a list of shots you must have in your video, like the lead guitar solo or the band walking across a bridge.,
Using your shot sheets, plan a shoot schedule for every location.,
When you are at a location, look at the scene through the camcorder.,
Once the location is lit & dressed (props in place, extras ready, etc.),
After reviewing the Master shot on a TV to insure it looks good, you can start getting the closeups on the list.,
This is a good time to shoot a bunch of artsy video.,
The key to getting a professional look is to shoot as much video as you can at each location.,
If you are unfamiliar with Non-Linear Editing applications (or NLEs,) you may want to draft a friend with their own NLE.,
Once all the video has been captured into the computer and loaded into the NLE, post-production begins with putting the digital recording of the music on the first audio track.,
The secret to creating a compelling video is twofold, work in layers and keep each shot short (less than 6 or 8 seconds is typical for music videos.),
The second layer is all the solo closeups, synched with the music by visually matching the audio tracks.,
The third layer contains the synched throw-away cut-aways.,
The final layer contains unsynced or wild shots.,
This structure makes it easy to adjust individual shots and try out different ideas.,
Render the final project in the highest quality possible.",How to Create a Video for a Song You Wrote," Videos fall into two general categories, performance or concept based. In a performance video, the underlying theme is a re-creation of a live concert. A concept video will generally tell a story that may or may not be obviously linked to the song. Both sorts of videos can include lip-synched performance clips, assorted band shots and any number of artsy shots. To get an idea of what kind of video you want to make, watch music video channels to find styles you like. Once you & your band has selected a style you like, you'll want get together and discuss it until you have a vision.;
, Be as specific as possible and list as many shots as you can think of. As you think of the shots you want, you also need to plan where & when you can shoot that video. If you are telling a story in your video, you need to have a complete list of how you can visually tell the story, like couple get drunk & argue, each person flirts with strangers until last call when they are left alone at closing.

, It is also nice to make a list of resources you'll need, such as guitars, matching outfits and scene extras. The two lists are essential for getting what you'll need during the shoots. You'll soon discover a field shoot can be very confusing & without a shot list you'll almost certainly miss one or two critical shots during the shoots.

, Is it too dark, too light or grainy you'll have to fix it before shooting. Interior locations will almost always benefit from more lighting, quartz work lights are cheap & effective. If they are casting hard shadows, you can usually bounce their light off the ceiling for a softer, shadowless look. You will also want to close the blinds & curtains to prevent hot spots and cause exposure problems.

, you're ready to shoot the Master Shot for that location. The Master Shot is a fairly wide shot of the talent doing their thing for the entire song. If it is a performance based video, this shot will be a stable, continuous shot of the band lip synching to the song. For a concept based video, you may not need to shoot the entire song at every location, but plan on 30 seconds of overlapping on both ends of the scene. The Master Shot will be the video you use when you don't have another shot to cover it with.

, You'll only need 5 or 10 seconds of overlap on these shots. Get video of all the solos (no matter how short) and shoot any vocals, all of it lip synched to the digital recording.

, Circling the talent, moving in & out, extreme angles and anything you think might look good.. A good way to get a variety of throw-away cut-aways is to enlist friends to shoot them with extra cameras, even web sharing cameras, while you are doing the quality closeups on the list.

, The more options during editing, the better the final product. It isn't unusual to shoot over an hour of video for a 3 or 4 minute music video. Trying to conserve video will cripple the editing.

, (And do it before shooting starts, you might even be able to use their camcorder at the shoot.) While it is possible for a first timer to edit a music video, it is much faster & easier if the editor knows a little about editing.

, The Master Shot (or shots) are placed on the first video track and the second audio track. You can easily synch the video to the master recording by visually aligning the audio tracks.

,

, It is up to you when you want to mute all the audio tracks except the master digital recording.

, Here's where you get to put in all the cool shots picked up with your alternate cameras.

, They are placed on the timeline to accent the main video and to keep the edit pace as rapid as possible. Viewers expect music videos to switch shots frequently, although the actual pacing will depend upon the tempo of the music itself. And don't forget about experimenting with special video effects, they can add some flash and make marginal shots into something special.

, It works equally well with performance or concept videos.

, And upload the video to all the video sharing sites you can.

Film night scenes during daylight.,
Play with light balance to tint your shots.,
Control light and darkness with flags.,
Try moving flags for spooky effects.,
Use cookies to cast weird patterns.",How to Make Special Effects for a Horror Movie1," Making this look authentic on screen might sound difficult, but for indoor shots, it's surprisingly easy. Simply turn the gain down on your camera so that it doesn't pick up very much light, and then use hard lighting as needed to control shadows in your “darkened” room. The camera will produce a very passable nighttime effect.


To create hard-edged and clearly defined shadows, you'll need powerful lights, which are easier to reconcile with daylight anyway. Using bright, powerful lights at night only makes it even harder to adjust the gain properly to produce a night effect.;
, A great way to add a sense of sickness or desolation to your horror scene is to tinge it with just a bit of color. Your video camera should have a white light balance setting that can be adjusted; this will cause it to pick up colors a bit differently. Combined with deliberate lighting, you can use balance to produce a great effect without using a gel or post-production filter.


Adjust the white balance setting to tungsten. The tungsten setting, called “indoor” on some cameras, adjusts the camera so that it treats bluish halogen lights as neutral white lights. In the absence of halogen lighting, this has the effect of tinting ordinary incandescent illumination a subtly eerie blue. This also allows you to use your halogen lights to make crisp shadows without being obvious, since the camera will treat their light as neutral.
Add fluorescent lighting. Leave the camera's white balance uncorrected, and the fluorescent lights will produce a subtle, sickly greenish effect. You may be able to slightly tweak the white balance to create a more pronounced effect. Fluorescent lighting is fairly harsh, making it useful for particularly horrifying sets such as blood-stained basements or old hospital rooms.

, For a classic film noir horror effect, you'll want most of your room wrapped in shadow, with the ability to define specific subjects with harsh, unforgiving light. Cheap halogen shop lights are great for this effect, but they tend to flood too much light into a room, ruining the shadowy background. Compensate by making flags for your lights. Flags are simply panels that can be adjusted to direct the flow of the light.


Flags can be made of simple corrugated cardboard, or practically any other opaque material. You or an assistant will have to manually hold them in place midway between the shot and the light source to properly control where the light goes.
The farther away you hold the panels from the light source, the harsher and clearer the shadows it casts will be, so set up the light well away from the action to produce the sharpest contrast between areas of light and darkness on your subject.
Halogen lights are phenomenally hot when lit. Keep yourself and your flags well away from them while filming.
If you want to, you can attach barn doors to your lights by making them from metal or another flame-proof material. Barn doors act like flags, except that they're attached to the light, so they don't sit far enough away to sharpen its edges. Instead, they're used to control the overall amount of light escaping from the source. Use them in conjunction with flags for the best effect.

, Slowly angling flags across a scene causes the shadows cast by the hard light source to slowly move, creating a sense of motion and unease. Flags can also be fully or partially flapped closed and then open again to create an unnerving blink or sputter effect. In close shots, turn your flags horizontally to light up one strip of a face or object, such as a grinning mouth, while leaving the rest in shadow.

, Cookies are shaped filters that go over your light source. By using squiggly or segmented cookies, you can add visual noise in the form of strange and unnatural-looking patterns of light and shadow in the background of a shot. Try placing them close to the light source for a subtle, static effect, or use them in conjunction with your flags to cast sharp shadows on a wall or ceiling.

Fill darkness with sounds.,
Learn about sound attack.,
Take advantage of free stock effects.,
Add original Foley effects.",How to Make Special Effects for a Horror Movie2," Being unable to see much of what's happening in the background is scary enough; adding a bump in the night can make it downright terrifying. Accentuate your shadow play and creepy lighting effects by punctuating the gloomiest shots with sound effects.


In most cases, a subtle ambient effect is appropriate. If nothing is actually going to jump out of the shadows, try adding the faint sound of wind blowing or a wooden board creaking. Even some soft radio static can work wonders. Try to pick something the audience won't consciously notice, but which will make them shift a little in their seats just the same.
From time to time, add a more definite sound. A shot that lingers on a darkened living room after its owner has left for the evening can be made scarier with a scraping, shuffling, or thumping sound. Your audience will know someone or something was inside the room with the character and went unnoticed, giving them big chills. Don't overuse these clearer effects, though, or they'll lose their power.

, The attack of a sound is the time it take for that sound to reach its maximum volume, before decaying and returning to no sound at all. Sounds with a fast attack include doors slamming, balloons popping, and dogs barking; sounds with a slow attack include wind whistling, boxes sliding down a ramp, and wolves howling. Generally speaking, the faster a sound's attack is, the more frightening it can be; loud volume enhances the effect.


Some of the most effective horror sounds are the result of mixing fast attack effects into a longer series. Footsteps slowly coming up the basement stairs, for example, is a classic effect that combines fast attack sounds (footsteps) into a repeating sequence that makes each one more dreadful than the last.
Try combining a fast attack sound and a slow attack sound to create an uneven, twisted feeling. A thump on the staircase is bad enough; a thump followed by a wet dragging sound (with slower attack) is truly horrifying, because the audience can hear that whatever is climbing the steps is misshapen or broken in some way.

, For the budget-conscious horror film maker, there are many high-quality sound effects that are licensed for free use. Most of these are now available online at sites like SoundBible.com. Caskets opening, zombies groaning, and people screaming are just a few of the effects you can use without having to pay.


Be sure to check the license associated with each free sound effect. Many of them are only free to use if you properly credit their creators.
Don't just check horror sound effects. There are many other sounds that can be easily repurposed for a horror film, with some creativity and forethought.

, Foley Editors have what is arguably one of the most entertaining and creative jobs in the film industry: they create sound effects, usually with everyday items, that approximate just about any noise imaginable. Some Foley effects are closely guarded secrets, but there are plenty you can do yourself to add a fresh, unique sound to an action or event. Get a good quality microphone and set it up near a nook with all the Foley prop items you need, and have at it.


Break bones or splinter limbs with wood or celery. To make a bone-snapping sound, wrap a thin dowel rod in soft paper (paper towels work) and snap it near the microphone. For a more sickening crunch, twist and snap a bunch of celery instead.
Add a gory effect to axe and club strikes. Use a length of garden hose slapped hard against a baseball glove to produce a meaty impact noise. A mallet on a pumpkin can accentuate a particularly devastating head strike.
Make a sickening impact noise with rags. To simulate the sound of something wet and disgusting falling and/or bursting on the ground, load up a bucket with soaked rags. Set up a short ladder on a concrete surface, then dump the rags from the top of the ladder onto the floor.
Add a sizzling effect to burn scenes. The quickest and easiest way to do this is to stretch a piece of wax paper near the microphone and then steadily pour uncooked rice down it. For a more authentic (albeit less dramatic) effect, put a hot iron in a tray with just a tiny amount of water. For sizzling fat, add a bit of oil on top of the water.

Mix up fake blood at home.,
Make burst bags.,
Shoot your victim through the chest.,
Stab your victim in the heart.,
Break a back over a monster's knee.,
Rip off your victim's hand.",How to Make Special Effects for a Horror Movie3," Scientist Steve Spangler has a great recipe that's useful for bleeding wounds, and is completely nontoxic, making it ideal for bite bags and other effects that might contact actual body fluids. It's as easy as mixing a cup of corn syrup, two tablespoons of cornstarch, and some coloring and thinning ingredients: two tablespoons of red food coloring, a bit of powdered cocoa and chocolate syrup to darken the color, and some fruit punch to thin and brighten it to your liking.


This recipe is especially useful since its thickness and color can be adjusted easily.

, The most basic method of doing this is to pour some of your fake blood into a cup, cover the top with cling wrap, pour the blood out into the cling wrap, and carefully pull up and cinch the cling wrap closed around the blood. It takes some practice to get right, and it's pretty messy in the meantime, so wear an apron and work somewhere that's easy to clean, like the kitchen counter.


To properly seal your burst bag, use a bit of gaffer tape. Gaffer tape is a lot like duct tape, but it doesn't leave the same gunky residue, so it's easier to clean up after.
Burst bags can be placed pretty much anywhere – palmed in a hand, held lightly in the mouth, or taped to the inside of a shirt or pant leg. As long as your actors don't ingest the cling wrap or the tape, burst bags are perfectly harmless and can add a great bloody effect to stabs and bullet wounds.
To burst the burst bag, simply apply pointed pressure until it pops. A burst bag in the mouth can be bitten to produce this effect.

, Start with a burst bag taped under the shirt where the shot will hit. Film the shot with a prop gun (use blanks, or edit the sound effect in later) and have the victim clutch at his or her torso, squeezing the bag to burst the blood out.

, Even with a prop knife (never use a real knife!), stabbing someone is an unpleasant experience for that person. Minimize his or her discomfort by making a bit of hidden armor out of some thin sheet metal and hard foam or rubber. Layer the foam on top of the metal, and cut both to make a plate you can attach over your victim's chest. Attach it with gaffer tape or bind it with twine, and then tape a burst bag to the front of it. When the victim is stabbed, the force from the knife tip should be more than enough to burst the blood bag.


The metal helps prevent the victim from feeling any discomfort, while the hard foam gives the knife a bit of sticking power for a more realistic effect.

, This dramatic effect can be simply achieved with stuffing and a spare set of clothes. Use leaves, cotton batting, or whatever other fill you want to stuff some plastic bags, then dress the bags up in a shirt and pants, binding them together at the waist with safety pins or thread so that the bags don't show in the middle. Run a thin dowel rod down the back of the shirt, and film a close shot of the monster bringing the dummy down over one knee, cracking the dowel.


You can use two rolled-up bags with light stuffing to make legs, and vary the distribution of the stuffing in the hips, waist, and chest to make the physique as realistic as possible.
If you don't get the scream right on the first try, there's no need to set up another dummy. Just add the scream in later.

, Mix water and cornstarch with red food coloring until you get a thick, viscous, blood-colored substance (remember, you can darken the blood with cocoa powder if needed). Use this extra-thick blood to fill a latex rubber glove. Have your victim hold the glove tightly at the end of a long-sleeved shirt arm, and film the hand being ripped away from the opposite side, so the fact that it's a glove is less obvious. Your thick fake blood should splatter everywhere when the victim releases the open glove.


Consider using a burst bag for extra “arm stump” bleeding as well.

Unwind a bit of the wire spiral binding from the notebook.,
Cut two rings from the exposed wire.Ideally, the two ends should overlap slightly so that you will have room to bend the wires back.,

Try on your snake bites to see how they fit!",How to Make Fake Snake Bites1," Try not to straighten the wire too much as you unwind it, but don't worry if you do because you can always use a pen or marker to reshape the wire into ring shapes.;
, Try to make sure that the rings are roughly the same size and shape, but don’t worry if they are not identical.

, Grip one of the rings using the pliers and use the other pair of pliers to help shape the ring so that it is more circular. If you are having trouble getting the wire into a nice round shape, wrap the wire around a pen or marker and use the pliers to tighten the wire.

, Use the pliers to bend back about 1/4"" of wire on each end and fold it so that it is aligned with the ring wire. Bending back the wire will redirect the pointed ends of the wire so that they are not pressing against your inner and outer lip. When you bend back the wires, make sure that the ring opening is wide enough to easily slide over your lip. This space should be about 1/4"" wide, but you may want it narrower or wider depending on the thickness of your lower lip. , Use the pliers and a pen or marker to reshape the rings after you have bent back the ends. Make sure that they look exactly how you want them to look.

, Simply slide each of the rings onto your lower lip and adjust their placement so that they are spaced equally on your lower lip. The two rings should be closely aligned with your canine teeth. If they are too loose or too tight, gently squeeze or pull on the rings to adjust the fit."

Let the person getting hit dictate any actual movement.,
Purchase safe, movie-specific props.,
Practice each action individually before stringing it all together.,
Add flourishes and details once the main actions are perfected.",How to Make a Fake Fighting Scene for a Movie1," A fake fight scene requires real coordination. To make a convincing fight scene you need actors that can fight convincingly. Whether you're filming a one-on-one duel or a big brawl, you want actors who can carry themselves with fluidity and coordination.


If your actors aren't comfortable moving a lot, you can still give them smaller parts in the fight. It will make your job much harder, however.
Fake fighting is closer to dancing than actual brawling, and requires a similar level of coordination and athleticism.;
, Do you want a blazing fast kung-fu battle or a slow, intense brawl? Will the fight be one-sided or will the combatants be evenly matched? Maybe one character is getting beaten up badly, but comes behind at the very end to win. Whatever your film, figure out the feel and progression of the fight before you start choreographing it.


How does each fighter behave? A noble warrior, for example, will fight very differently from a scoundrel pirate.
Do you want gritty, realistic violence or something more fun and cartoonish? How serious is this fight?
If you're not making the movie alone, show your cast and crew fight scenes from 3-4 movies you want your scene to look like. This helps everyone get on the same page., This is non-negotiable -- any closer and you risk real injury, any further and the hit will look unconvincing. Say Kim needs to kick at Ron's head. There are two ways to play it. First, Kim can kick in front of Ron's face, arching her foot in front of his nose. Second, she can kick past his head, flying past his ear.


A third method is to let Ron dodge the blow, which is much easier to shoot than fake contact because you don't need to ""cheat"" the impact of the kick., If Kim is throwing that kick Ron needs to realistically get hit by it. As the kick passes his head, Ron should launch himself in the same direction, mimicking the contact. Take it at 50% speed at first so that both actors know exactly what is happening and where they need to go, then slowly ratchet up the speed with each rehearsal.


Let each blow land where an actor just was for the best results. If Kim throws a punch, have Ron back up as he reacts to it, helping sell the movement., Say Kim needs to throw Ron to the floor for the scene. Kim wouldn't ever actually throw Ron. Instead, she would just grab Ron, who would then throw himself to the floor. Kim would simply fake the throw by following Ron's lead. This makes the timing much more fluid and far safer, and should be used in a variety of scenarios:


Say Kim grabs Ron's hand and breaks his arm at the elbow. All Kim should do is grab the hand, letting Ron move himself to the floor as she follows him down.
If Kim needs to slam Ron's head against the wall, Ron should throw his head within six inches of the wall and fake the bounce back up. She simply follows his head with her hand.

, Never use a real weapon on set, even if it is supposed to be just seen in the background. Props should always be harmless and completely safe. In professional movies, prop masters must be professionally firearm trained, even with blanks and fake guns, and for a good reason -- even blanks have caused injury when played with or used inappropriately.


You can purchase realistic foam baseball bats, swords, nunchucks, and much more online from movie prop websites.
Prop knives should be retractable, meaning they hide when you ""stab"" someone.
Guns, even rubber ones, should be covered with a bright muzzle indicating that they are fake whenever they are not in use.

, For example, say your scene starts with traded punches, moves to a dodged kick, and ends with Kim throwing Ron to the ground. You should master the punches, the kick, and the throw individually, then slowly piece them together. When choreographing scenes, go slowly, taking it one piece at a time to ensure perfection and safety., Think back to the tone of your fight, and the attitudes of your characters. For example, a noble and experienced warrior will be calm and confident. When not fighting they will be poised and still. A less experienced fighter, however, is generally jittery and nervous. They make big, energetic movements, bounce or shake when not in action, etc. Once your actual action is choreographed, spend some time making the fight look artistic.


Make sure you rehearse in costume as well. Actors need to practice in the clothes they will actually have to fight in."

, Try to make sure that the rings are roughly the same size and shape, but don’t worry if they are not identical.

, Use the pliers to bend back about 1/4"" of wire on each end and fold it so that it is aligned with the ring wire. Bending back the wire will redirect the pointed ends of the wire so that they are not pressing against your inner and outer lip. When you bend back the wires, make sure that the ring opening is wide enough to easily slide over your lip. This space should be about 1/4"" wide, but you may want it narrower or wider depending on the thickness of your lower lip.

, Use the pliers to reshape the rings after you have bent back the ends. Make sure that they look exactly how you want them to look.

, Simply slide each of the rings onto your lower lip and adjust their placement so that they are spaced equally on your lower lip. The two rings should be closely aligned with your canine teeth. If they are too loose or too tight, gently squeeze or pull on the rings to adjust the fit.,, You can buy these in a variety of sizes and materials. Choose ones that appeal to you. Don’t worry about the bead’s color or design since you will be removing it., Remove the captive beads from the rings by gently pulling the two sides of the ring apart and letting the bead drop out. You do not need to keep the beads unless you think you might want to use the captive bead ring as an actual piercing at some point. , Simply slide each of the rings onto your lower lip and adjust their placement so that they are spaced equally on your lower lip. The two rings should be closely aligned with your canine teeth. If they are too loose or too tight, gently squeeze or pull on the rings to adjust the fit."

Share a safe word with every single person on set.,
Announce any time a scene is going to contain a fake weapon.,
Place your camera so that it completely minimizes the air between the actors.,
Give your actors ""marks"" on the actual set.,
Shoot in pieces, focusing on one actor at a time.,
Hold the camera instead of using a tripod.,
Keep the camera zoomed in.,
Shoot away from safety equipment.",How to Make a Fake Fighting Scene for a Movie2," If anyone is at all is uncomfortable with the fight, the choreography, or on-set safety, they need a way to instantly end it. Since ""stop!"" is something that people often shout during fights, you want a unique word that will cause everyone to immediately end the fight.


Safety is paramount when staging fake fights-- while there should be no actual contact, there is a real chance of injury if someone misses a cue or maneuver., This is incredibly important for everyone's safety. You may know that a knife is a prop, but that doesn't mean the rest of the cast, crew, or passerby will know that. Any scene with a fake weapon should be broadcast to everyone around.


If in a public place, consider sticking someone on the street to intercept and warn passerby.
If the police show up, do not try to convince them the weapon is fake immediately. Drop the weapon, put your hands up, and explain once you are asked.

, For example, Kim is on the left of the screen and Ron is on the right, and Kim needs to punch Ron with her left hand. Kim could throw a hook around Ron's jaw, but to dodge him she'd have to pass by his nose, leaving a ton of empty air in front of him. To fix this, Kim could throw a straight punch, coming across his face and past Ron's ear, meaning the camera sees no empty space between the punch and Ron's face.


Alternatively, put the camera behind Kim's shoulder. This way she can throw the hook in front of Ron's nose without anyone noticing she never actually hit him., Place tape on the ground that lets the actors know where they need to land each motion in order to be in the shot. This takes away the guesswork for each move and helps keep everyone safe -- you can be assured, for example, that the puncher stays six inches away from the one getting hit.


Make sure these marks don't let the actors get blinded by lights or, even worse, put them in a place to slip on fake blood or something else on set.
If you need to shoot down low and can see the floor, use the marks for rehearsal and only remove them once you're ready to shoot., Don't try and capture everything at once -- it will be impossible. Instead, cover each fighter individually. If you have multiple cameras, you can often do this at once. However, one camera works too. Returning to Kim and Ron, get every one of Kim's punches 2-3 times, using slightly different angles. Then get Ron's reaction 2-3 times as well.


This allows the editor to cut from Kim's punch to Ron's stumble backwards, helping hide the fact that Kim never actually hits Ron at all., A handheld camera will naturally shake, and you can quickly pivot it when needed. This allows you to ""hide"" the fake punches so that no one can tell that they didn't actually hit, and the shakiness lends the scene a frantic, high-energy feel. That said, do not intentionally shake the camera -- it will be far too wild to see anything. Just let your natural movement add a little bit of wobble to the shot., Great fight choreographers like Bruce Lee can get away with wide camera angles because they have the timing and athleticism to make every motion convincing. Most fight scenes, however, stay up close for any actual ""contact"" because it minimizes the distance you need to cheat with fake punches. Furthermore, tight angles make viewers feel like they are right in the middle of the action.


Good chances to go wide are choreographed bits where no one actually gets hit -- such as sections where both fighters dodge several blows in a row.

, If you're throwing a character, you'll want some pillows to land on. But you don't want these pillows in the shot. Once your fight is choreographed, come up with novel camera angles to hide the essential equipment.


If a character slams into a wall, shoot from behind them so that the actor's body hides the safety pad.
For the throw, a common choice is to shoot up at the person, so they fall towards the camera and land out of frame below it."
"
Use quick cuts to give the impression of action.,
Hide each moment of contact in a cut.,
Focus on sound design to sell your fake fight scene.,
Have the actors add their personal sound effects to the final scene.,
Aim for a scene with both clarity and chaos.",How to Make a Fake Fighting Scene for a Movie3," The best way to hide the fact that fight is fake is to keep the cuts moving. This allows people to see the flying fists without needing to see the landing, as the audience's brain will fill in the part where the punch hit's the opponent's face, even though it didn't actually happen. The quicker the cuts the more frantic and chaotic a scene looks, which is perfect for fights.


Don't be surprised, in a busy action scene, if many of your cuts are 2-3 second or shorter.
You can go too fast, which makes a scene too confusing to follow. Find ways to slow the scene down occasionally, like using a long cut of a character catching their breath before jumping back into the fray.

, This is especially important if the shot of a fake punch seems fake. Start with a shot of Kim throwing her punch at Ron. Right as she would hit him in a real fight, cut to an angle of Ron starting his reaction away from her fist. The cut tells a viewer that contact was made without ever having to show it.

, The visuals of a fight scene are hard to do, but it is the sound that truly distinguishes a good fight from a bad one. Timing up each punch with a bone-cracking sound effect, grunts from the actors, and whooshes of air as each kick flies takes hours of time, but will help your scene stand out. Go back and watch 2-3 of your favorite action scenes and pay attention to every single sound -- from footsteps to cries of pain.


For really incredible scenes, you'll need to do ""foley."" This is when you record and create all the sound effects yourself, such as watching the scene and stomping in time with the action to create perfectly timed footsteps., Get the actors mic'd up and have them grunt, scream, and breath heavily in time with their actions on screen. Let them watch the scene 1-2 times to get ready for each moment, then simply turn the mic on and let them improvise the noises they might make in a real fight.


You can make these noises yourself, but it is always better when the actual actors voice their own sound effects.

, Fight scenes are not easy to edit -- you want it to be clear what is happening, but also frantic and high-energy enough to mimic a real fight. Good ways to do this are to use lots of non-contact shots to show who is winning. For example, you might linger on a shot of the person getting hit to show they are losing, while showing lots of the winner throwing punches without getting hit back.


Jackie Chan solved this problem by staging simple, clear fight scenes then speeding them up very slightly during editing. The result is a coherent fight with long cuts that is also high-energy."

Cut pieces of PVC pipe.,
Cut and sew fabric.,
Decide how you will attach the screen.,
Connect your PVC pipe.,
Try an alternative with microphone stands.,
Keep PVC loose or glue it.,
Attach the screen and pull flat.,
Set up in a well-lit area.,
Move or disassemble when done.",How to Build a Portable Green Screen," Buy ½ inch PVC pipe from a standard hardware store, along with 8 T-joint connectors, 4 end caps, and 2 elbow joints, all in the same ½” size. Get 4 10-foot lengths and use a hacksaw or ask staff at the hardware store to cut the following pieces from them:


One 6ft 1/2″ PVC
Four 3ft 1/2″ PVC
Five 2.5ft 1/2″ PVC
Two 2ft 1/2″ PVC
Four 1ft 1/2″ PVCNote that these lengths include enough material to brace the frame with two horizontal pieces and a small vertical piece that connects them. If you use thicker PVC pipe (like ¾” or 1”) the frame will be sturdier and you may not need this bracing.;
, Look in any store that sells fabric for a bright green color of natural or synthetic fabric that won't wrinkle easily. Purchase at least 2-3 yards of fabric that is 48 inches wide or wider.


Note that a standard width for fabric is 48 inches, or 4 feet. If you want a green screen wider than that, look for fabric that comes in a 54"" or 60” width, or sew two pieces of fabric together for an even larger size.It’s also a good idea to iron your fabric so that it is free of wrinkles before use as a green screen. Visible wrinkles that show up on camera will interfere with the keying process that replaces the color with another image.If you cannot find a suitable green color of fabric, you may be able to paint or dye fabric to your desired shade. However, this method may not turn out as even or consistent as a pre-dyed fabric.

, Determine how you would like to attach your green fabric to the top of the frame. Use clamps, sewing, or elastic depending on your preferences.


Get A clamps (or spring clamps) to clamp the fabric to the top of the frame. You will also use these to attach the fabric smoothly to the sides of the frame, so you can grab a few more with very little expense from a hardware store.
Try sewing a “pocket” into the top of the fabric by folding it over and sewing to create a long loop through which to slide the PVC pipe.Use approximately 6 inch pieces of elastic band fabric, folded over to create loops large enough to fit around your PVC pipe. Then sew or staple these loops to the fabric wherever you want it to connect to your frame., Use your connectors to attach the pieces of PVC pipe together to create a rectangular frame with two “feet.” Build the frame as follows:


Use the two elbow connectors to attach your 6’ PVC piece to two of your 2.5’ pieces.
Use one T-joint connector on each side to attach those 2.5’ pieces to two more 2.5’ pieces (which will be vertical) and two 3’ pieces (which will be horizontal) to fill the T-joints.
Fill another T-joint connector on each side with the 2.5’ pieces you just installed, two more 3’ pieces (horizontal), and your two 2’ pieces (vertical).
Connect the horizontal 3’ pieces in the middle with two T-joints and one 2.5’ piece vertically between them.
Make the feet by connecting two 1’ pieces together with the end of your 2’ piece on either side using a T-joint. Then add end caps to the open ends of all four 1’ pieces., Use microphone stands as an alternative method for an adjustable stand. You may choose this method if you already have mic stands available, if you want to use less PVC pipe, or you want the height of the frame to be more easily adjusted.


Build a simpler PVC frame of three long pieces for the top and sides of the frame. Then use two microphone stands with the extensions removed and slide the side pieces of PVC pipe over the mic stands so the frame stands upright. Adjust the height of the frame by raising the PVC higher or lower on the mic stands and placing a clamp underneath to keep in place.Or try using just one piece of PVC pipe for the top bar of the frame, then slide either end of it into a mic stand grip. Adjust each mic stand accordingly to change the height of the screen.Note that when using microphone stands, you may want to choose thicker PVC pipe, like 1” PVC, for sturdiness.

, Glue your PVC frame pieces together using PVC glue if you want to make the frame more permanent. Keep the pieces unglued if you want to take the frame apart later.


Choose to glue if you’re sure you want to keep the frame intact and at the same size and structure. It can still be portable due to the very light weight of the PVC.
Choose to keep the frame unglued if you want to make it even more portable by breaking it down for easier travel or storage. Of course, this will require reassembly each time it’s used.

, Attach your green fabric to the top bar of your frame using whatever method you choose, be it clamps, a sewed pocket, or elastic straps. Then make it taut across all sides with clamps.


If using a sewed pocket or elastic strap loops, slide them onto the top bar before connecting it to the rest of your frame.
Adjust the fabric so that it falls flat and evenly from the top of the frame. Then use as many clamps as you need to attach it to the sides (and even the bottom) of the frame to create as even, unwrinkled, and unstretched a surface as possible.

, Set up your green screen frame wherever you wish to use it. The best results for video editing will come from using very even, consistent lighting for filming in front of the green screen.


Try using the green screen outdoors in overcast weather, or indoors using five individual lights: two main lights (which illuminate the subject being filmed), two fill lights (which illuminate the green screen), and a backlight (which will help distinguish the subject from the green screen for editing).Ensure that every time you set up the green screen, the lighting or fabric itself doesn’t illuminate any creases or wrinkles that will show up when filming and affect the editing process of replacing the green color. Iron or steam the fabric if necessary to achieve a smooth surface.

, Easily reposition the entire frame with the fabric still attached, or undo the pieces of the frame to make it a size that’s easy to transport or store.


To avoid removing the green fabric every time, try rolling it onto the top bar of your frame before disassembling or storing. This will keep the fabric wrinkle-free as well. You can hold the fabric in place once rolled with a few pieces of tape, velcro or elastic straps, or rubber bands.It’s helpful to take a picture or draw a quick diagram of your assembled frame before taking it apart. This will make it easier to reassemble in the same way next time you use it.

Create a website for the movie, a Facebook page, a Twitter page, create posters, and fliers.,
Distribute.",How to Create a Film Narrative," This is more important than you may think, as it is a detailed list of things that happen in each scene. A paragraph per scene is probably good. This will help with writing the screenplay, as you will know exactly what happens.;
, Use the proper format if you want. Google that, and you will get results for how to format your screenplay.

, This may seem tedious, but it will help. Basically, this is a comic strip version of the screenplay. It shows camera angles and camera movements.

, For the crew, you will need a Producer, a Director, a Cinematographer, and an audiographer. The audiographer is in charge of voice recordings, and the sound aspect. The Cinematographer is in charge of the camera guy, and if you want to have a photo shoot for a movie poster, the Cinematographer is in charge of the photographer. audiographer would also be in charge of the original score, if you have one.

, Take your time on this step, as it is very important. When Stanley Kubrick directed The Shining, he did over a hundred takes for each scene. It was supposed to be a seventeen week shoot, but it stretched out to almost a full year. Also, his film Eyes Wide Shut, the shooting lasted over four hundred days. You don't have to be this extreme, but make sure you are careful. Once you get a take that is really good, get about a dozen more that are just as good.

, This is the step after filming, but before editing. What you want to do here is get photos taken for movie posters, or DVD covers. Also, do some voice recordings if you are doing voice overs. Again, be very careful with this step.

, Select the very best versions of each scene, and string them all together, so that it works. However, the best version of scene 1 may not go with the best version of scene 2, so use your judgment. Make sure that the transitions are how you want them. Also, edit voices.

, Spread the news around, and get a word of mouth campaign going.

, Burn the movie onto DVDs. Sell them. Ask some local movie theaters if they will show it. Get profits from that.

Figure out what type of bruise you want to make.,
Determine placement of your bruise.,
Avoid areas partially covered by clothing.",How to Make a Fake Bruise1," Do you want your bruise to look fresh, nearly healed, or somewhere in between? It's a good idea to keep in mind what type of bruise your character is likely to have and know what these bruises look like in real life.


Very fresh bruises: When a person sustains a bruising injury, fresh blood leaks from damaged vessels into the surrounding tissues like the skin. Because of this, a fresh bruise will appear to be bright red. This kind of bruise may be appropriate if you are playing a boxer.
Bruises that are hours old: Once the leaked blood loses its oxygen, it will take on a darker hue and begin to look more blue or purplish. If your character was in a car accident earlier that day, this type would be a good choice.
Bruises that are days old: Bruises often darken during the first few days following an injury, sometimes even becoming black. Use these darker-colored bruises if a character had gotten into a fight recently but not that day. Dark purple bruises also go well with zombie costumes.
Healing bruises: Bruises that have begun to heal will start to display a green color due to blood protein breaking down. Once the bruise has almost healed completely, it will begin to look lighter and a yellow color will appear. Use these bruises to show that a character had been injured in the recent past but has recovered.;
, How did your character get the bruise? If your character has been punched in the face, apply a nasty fake bruise to your eye socket, cheekbone, or the bridge of your nose. Bruises on knees, elbows, or shins may convey that your character is either clumsy or athletic.If you are making a zombie costume, think about how ""you"" may have died. Add bruises to appropriate areas based on your character's cause of death.

, Even the most gentle dyes and cosmetics can cause unforeseen stains in clothing. Unless you are wearing clothes that are fine to permanently stain, avoid putting bruises anywhere near where clothing will lie. Be safe and leave at least two inches between the edge of your clothes and the bruise in case the clothing shifts while wearing it.

Gather your materials.,
Sponge on your lightest color as the underlayer.,
Sponge on darker layers.,
Add any details or finishing touches.",How to Make a Fake Bruise2," Buy a makeup palette from a costume shop or party supply store. Many different manufacturers of theatrical makeup make palettes especially designed for creating fake bruises. You may also buy separate compacts instead if you'd like. You will also need a makeup sponge for each color to keep from ruining the palette.


Bruises will generally require the following colors: dark maroon, blood red, dark blue, purple, pale green, and yellow.
This method will give you the most realistic-looking results.

, For healing bruises, this will be yellow or pale green. For all other bruises, use bright blood red. Avoid making solid lines or obvious shapes that would look strange on a real bruise., Cover most of the underlayer first in maroon. Then, sponge on a layer of purple over most of the maroon. Use the makeup sponge to blend well at the edges of each layer. For healing bruises, skip maroon and use purple only. Sponge the purple around the perimeter of the bruise and leave a spot of underlayer visible in the center.
For fresh bruises, leave most of the red underlayer visible and add just a bit of maroon for shadows. Skip adding other colors.

, Small splashes or patches of other colors from your bruise palette can add variety. Make sure to blend all layers well with a sponge to avoid looking fake or cheesy. Once you've finished completely, set your bruise with powder."

, Blot your brush to create uneven edges that are already partially blended. Use only a sparse amount of pigment. If you are finding you must cake on this base to get it appropriately dark, use a different slightly darker eye shadow to begin with instead., Use your fingertips. Concentrate the shadows where your bruise's imaginary impact point may be. This will be the darkest part of your bruise., Use your fingers to add just a touch of these colors to the periphery of your bruise. Finish up by blending everything with a fresh brush."
"
Gather your materials.,
Dot the location of your bruise with your base color.,
Smear the dot of food coloring before it dries.,
Add a second color over the base.,
Blend the colors using petroleum jelly.",How to Make a Fake Bruise4," You will need food coloring, petroleum jelly, and paper towels. The exact colors you will need will depend on your bruise. Remember that fresher bruises will use more bright reds, established bruises will include darker blues and purples, and healing bruises begin to first display green and then yellow.


This technique is best for smaller bruises, as it is much harder to apply for a realistic look.

, For most bruises, you will want to go with red as the base color. Use yellow instead for nearly-healed bruised.

, Use your index finger to create the general shape of your bruise. If you want a lighter spot in the middle, which often occurs in established and healing bruises, be sure to wipe off any excess food coloring with a paper towel.


Keep in mind that real bruises are usually very irregular. Don't make perfect shapes with the smear. Make the edges uneven and jagged.

, This will be blue or green for newer bruises or brown for healing ones. Mix together red and green to make brown. Put a dot of this second color on top of the base you've already made. Smear it in a similar but not exactly overlapping pattern. Wipe off the excess with a paper towel.


For fresh bruises, instead of a second color stick to red only. Blend and create variations in color intensity with a little water.

, Take a small dab of petroleum jelly with your finger and rub it over your fake bruise to blend. Focus on areas like edges and where the two colors overlap. The more well-blended the bruise, the more convincing it will look. Once you've finished, wipe off the petroleum jelly with a paper towel.

Red eyeshadow will work as well.;
, Sharpen your red eyeliner pencil. In the center of the smudged area, draw a thin line.








, If you want a larger, more gory wound, add a dark brown or dark red line next to the thin, red line. Dab the lines with your finger to smear them together slightly, without wiping away their shape.

It's best to wear the rest of your costume while you work, since changing clothes can mess up the cut, but protect the costume with an apron or bib if you are working on your face or neck.

, Use a damp makeup sponge to lightly coat the area you plan to decorate, then wait until it dries. You can skip this step if you like, but a base of eyelash glue can be easily removed later using body oil or eyelash glue remover.







, If you want to embed fake razor blades or tubes of squirting blood in your wound, the fake skin needs to be extra sturdy. You can make it out of gelatin powder and a couple other ingredients:Warm several plates in an oven set to the lowest available temperature, until it is warm but not too hot to touch. Put a metal baking tray in the freezer.
Mix gelatine powder, water, and liquid glycerin (hand soap) in equal amounts. There should be no sweetener or other additions in any of these ingredients.
Heat this in a microwave in 5–10 second bursts, until it is a homogenous liquid. Do not touch it at this stage, as it can cause nasty burns.
Take the plates out of the oven. Wearing gloves, pour the gelatin in a thin layer onto the plate. Tip the plate to spread it as thin as possible, then transfer the plate to the cold tray to set it in that thin shape.

, Put the gelatin on your skin and wait for it to become firm before you cut into it. Use a butter knife or your fingers to gently tear apart a slit at the center of the tissue paper. Curl or pull back the edges around the slit, to form a raise layer of fake scar tissue.








For a long cut, keep the tear long but narrow. For a more shocking wound, tear it into a wide, mangled mess.

, Cover the inside of the slit completely, applying the material with a paintbrush. Only use face paint approved for use on skin. Other types of paint can cause rashes or more serious health problems.








A non-toxic label does not guarantee the product is skin-safe.

, You'll only need a small amount, so mix this in a shot glass or other small container. The end result should look like dirty blood, as though your cut has been exposed to dirt and air for hours.Use a paintbrush to apply this to the fake wound.









If your fake skin already matches your skin tone well, you can skip this step, or just sprinkle on cocoa powder for a dirty appearance.
If the mixture is too pale or runny, mix in corn starch or honey to thicken it.This thicker mixture can also double as fake blood in the steps below.

, Use a makeup sponge, foundation brush, or fingers to blend foundation around the wound, applying it in small circular motions.This can be the same shade as your skin tone, or slightly lighter.








If you do not have foundation, or if foundation alone doesn't look convincing, roughly brush on the cocoa powder and food coloring mixture.

, Make the cut extra-gruesome by dabbing a generous amount of glistening fake blood in the center of the cut. Decorate the skin around the wound with the excess blood:









Dip a cotton swab in fake blood and let it drip onto the skin around your wound, while holding it vertical.
Wet a toothbrush in fake blood and pull back the bristles with your fingers, letting go to spray the wound with blood splatter., The gelatin skin should be strong enough to hold small objects. You can purchase fake glass shards, fake razor blades, or similar objects at Halloween stores or dollar stores, and slip them into the fake skin. A thoroughly cooked, washed, and broken chicken bone adds an especially gory effect.


Never use real blades or shards, even plastic ones, or you could cause an actual injury.

, For this, you'll need a medical oxygen line sold at drugstores, or an air tube from an aquarium stores, as well as a rubber squeeze bulb that fits tightly over the tubing.Fill the squeeze bulb mostly full of fake blood, then fit the tubing into the bulb. Hide this in your shirt sleeve or under the gelatin fake skin, with the other end of the tubing at the center of your wound. Squeeze the bulb to send out a squirt of blood.


Check the label when buying fake blood. Light-viscosity fake blood creates a more dramatic squirting effect."

Make sure your topic isn't something mundane or universally agreed-upon. Try instead to focus on subjects that are controversial or not-well known, or try to shed new light on a person, issue, or event that the public has largely made its mind up about. In simplest terms, try to film things that are interesting and to avoid things that are boring or ordinary. This doesn't mean your documentary has to be huge or grandiose - smaller-scale, more intimate documentaries have just as much of an opportunity to resonate with an audience if the story they tell is captivating.

,


Try out your ideas in verbal form first. Start telling your documentary idea in story form to your family and friends. Based on their reaction, you may do one of two things; scrap the idea completely or revise it and move forward.
Though documentaries are educational, they still have to hold the audience's attention. Here, a good topic can do wonders. Many documentaries are about controversial social issues. Others are about past events that stir up strong emotions. Some challenge the things that society views as normal. Some tell the story of individual people or events to make conclusions about larger trends or issues. Whether you choose one of these approaches or not, make sure you pick a subject with the potential to hold an audience's attention.
For instance, it would be a bad idea to make a documentary about everyday life in a random small town unless you're really confident you can make the lives of ordinary people interesting and meaningful in some way. A better idea would be to cast the daily life of this small town against the story of a grisly murder that took place there, showing how the town's inhabitants were affected by the crime.

, Good documentaries almost always have a point - a good documentary may ask a question about the way our society operates, attempt to prove or disprove the validity of a certain point of view, or cast light on an event or phenomenon unknown to the general public in hopes of spurring action.Even documentaries about events that happened far in the past can draw connections to the world today. Despite its name, the purpose of a documentary isn't just to document something that occurred. The objective of a documentary shouldn't just be to show that something interesting occurred - a really good documentary should persuade, surprise, question, and/or challenge the audience. Try to show why an audience should feel a certain way about the people and things you're filming.


Acclaimed director Col Spector says that, along with not choosing a worthy subject, not asking any serious questions and not choosing an overriding theme are two of the most serious mistakes a documentary filmmaker can make. Says Spector: ""Before filming, ask yourself, what question am I asking and how does this film express my worldview?"", Even if you're familiar with your topic it's still a very smart idea to research it extensively before you begin filming. Read about your topic as much as you can. Watch films about your topic that already exist. Use the Internet and any library you have access to to find information. Most importantly, talk to people who know about or are interested in your subject - the stories and details that these people provide will guide the plan for your film.


Once you've decided on a general topic you are interested in, use your research to help you narrow your topic down. If, for instance, you are interested in cars, pinpoint people, events, processes, and facts relating to cars that you come across in your research that specifically interest you. For example, your may narrow down a documentary about cars to one about a specific group of people who work on classic cars and gather to show them off and talk about them. Narrowly-focused documentaries are often easier to film and sometimes easier to make compelling to an audience.
Learn as much as you can about the subject and scope out the landscape to see if there is already a documentary or media project out there. Wherever possible, you want your documentary and approach to the subject to be different than anything that might also be out there.
Do a few pre-interviews based on your research. This allows you the opportunity to start developing a story idea with main subject perspectives.

, This is very handy for project direction and possible funders. The outline also gives you an idea of story, as your project must be story-driven with all the elements of a good story. In the outline process, you should also explore the conflict and drama that you will need to keep the story alive as it unspools.

, It's entirely possible for one person to research, plan, shoot, and edit a documentary by his or herself, especially if the documentary's scope is relatively small or intimate. However, many may find this ""one person, one camera"" approach to be exceedingly difficult or to result in amateurish, unpolished footage. Consider hiring or recruiting experienced help for your documentary, especially if you're tackling an ambitious topic or you want your film to have a polished, professional quality.


To get help, you may try recruiting qualified friends and acquaintances, advertising your project via flyers or online postings, or contacting a talent agency. Here are just a few types of professionals you might consider employing:

Cameramen
Lighting riggers
Writers
Researchers
Editors
Actors (for scripted sequences/recreations)
Audio recorders/editors
Technical consultants.



, Also consider hiring young up-and-coming crew who are inspired and in touch with markets and audiences you may have overlooked.


Always confer with your camera op and other creative folks involved in the documentary. This helps make your docs a collaborative effort, with a shared vision. Working in a collaborative environment means that you'll often find your crew seeing something and contributing to the project in ways you may have overlooked.

, Serious documentary film makers should, at the very least, understand how films are produced, staged, shot, and edited, even if they can't do all of these things by themselves. If you're unaware of the technical process behind making films, you may find it worthwhile to study film making before shooting your documentary. Many colleges and universities offer film making courses, but you can also get practical experience by working around film sets either in front of or behind the camera.


Though many directors have a film school background, practical knowledge can trump a formal film making education. For instance, comedian Louis C.K., who has worked as a director in film and television, got early film making experience by working at a local public access station., Try to use the best quality media available (high end cameras etc.). Beg or borrow equipment you can't otherwise afford, and use your contacts to get access to subjects and equipment.

, You don't necessarily need to know exactly how your documentary is going to come together before you start shooting - you may discover things during the process of filming that change your plans or offer new avenues of investigation. However, you should definitely have a plan before you start shooting, including an outline of specific footage you want to shoot. Having a plan ahead of time will give you extra time to schedule interviews, work around scheduling conflicts, etc. Your plan for shooting should include:


Specific people you want to interview - make contact with these people as early as possible to schedule interviews.
Specific events you want to record as they occur - arrange travel to and from these events, buy tickets if necessary, and get permission from the event's planners to be able to shoot at the event.
Specific writings, pictures, drawings, music, and/or other documents you want to use. Get permission to use these from the creator(s) before you add them to your documentary.
Any dramatic recreations you want to shoot. Search for actors, props, and shooting locations well ahead of time.

, Many documentaries devote much of their running time to one-on-one interviews with people who are knowledgeable about the subject of the documentary. Pick a selection of relevant people to interview and collect as much footage as you can from these interviews. You'll be able to splice this footage throughout your documentary to help prove your point or convey your message. Interviews can be ""news style"" - in other words, simply sticking a microphone in someone's face - but you'll probably want want to rely more on one-on-one sit-down interviews, as these give you a chance to control the lighting, staging, and sound quality of your footage while also allowing your subject to relax, take his or her time, tell stories, etc.


These people may be famous or important - well-known authors who have written about your subject, for instance, or professors who have studied it extensively. However, many of these people may not be famous or important. They may be ordinary people whose work has given them a familiarity of your subject or people who simply witnessed an important event firsthand. They can, in certain situations, even be completely ignorant of your subject - it can even be enlightening (and entertaining) for the audience to hear the difference between a knowledgeable person's opinion and an ignorant person's opinion.
Let's say our car documentary is on classic car aficionados in Austin, Texas. Here are just a few ideas for people to interview: members of classic car clubs in and around Austin, wealthy car collectors, cranky old people who have complained to the city about the noise from these cars, first-time visitors to a classic car show, and mechanics who work on the cars.
If you're stumped for interview questions, brainstorm questions based on the basic queries ""who?"" ""what?"" ""why?"" ""when?"" ""where?"" and ""how?"" Often, asking someone these basic questions about your subject will be enough to get him or her to relate an interesting story or some enlightening details.
Remember––a good interview should be more like a conversation. As the interviewer, you must be prepared, having done your research and informed yourself to glean the most information from the interview subject.
Grab B-roll whenever possible. Get shots of your interview subject after the formal interview. This allows you to cutaway from the talking head shot.

, One of the main advantages of documentary films (as opposed to dramatic films) is that they allow the director to show the audience real footage of actual real-life events. Provided you don't break any privacy laws, get as much real-world footage as you can. Film events that support your documentary's viewpoint, or, if the subject of your documentary happened in the past, get in touch with agencies or people who have historical footage to get permission to use it. For instance, if you're making a documentary on police brutality during the Occupy Wall Street protests, you may want to contact people who participated in the protests and collected hand-held footage.


In our car documentary, we'd obviously want lots of footage of classic car expos taking place in and around Austin. If we're creative, though, there are plenty of other things we might want to film: a town hall discussion on a proposed car show ban, for instance, might provide some thrilling dramatic tension.

, If you've watched a documentary before, you've surely noticed that the entire movie isn't just footage of interviews and of live events with nothing in between. For instance, there are often shots leading into interviews that establish a mood or show where the interview is taking place by showing the outside of the building, the city skyline, etc. These are called ""establishing shots,"" and they're a small but important part of your documentary.


In our car documentary, we'd want to film establishing shots at the locations where our interviews took place: in this case, classic car museums, chop shops, etc. We might also want to get some footage of downtown Austin or of distinct Austin landmarks to give the audience a sense of the locale.
Always collect audio from the shoot including room tone and sound effects unique to that location.

, In addition to establishing shots, you'll also want to get secondary footage called ""B-roll"" - this can be footage of important objects, interesting processes, or stock footage of historical events. B-roll is important for maintaining the visual fluidity of your documentary and ensuring a brisk pace, as it allows you to keep the film visually active even as the audio lingers on one person's speech.


In our documentary, we'd want to collect as much car-related B-roll as possible - glamorous close-ups of shiny car bodies, headlights, etc., as well as footage of the cars in motion.
B-roll is especially important if your documentary will make use of extensive voiceover narration. Since you can't play the narration over interview footage without keeping the audience from hearing what your subject is saying, you'll usually lay the voiceover over short stretches of B-roll. You can also use B-roll to mask the flaws in interviews that didn't go perfectly. For instance, if your subject had a coughing fit in the middle of an otherwise great interview, during the editing process, you can cut the coughing fit out, then set the audio of the interview to B-roll footage, masking the cut.

, If there's no real-life footage of an event your documentary discusses, it's acceptable to use actors to re-create the event for your camera, provided the recreation is informed by real-world fact and it's perfectly clear to the audience that the footage is a recreation. Be reasonable with what you film as a dramatic recreation - make sure that whatever you commit to film is grounded in reality.


Sometimes, dramatic recreations will obscure the actors' faces. This is because it can be jarring for an audience to see an actor portray a real-world person in a film that also contains real footage of him or her.
You may want to film or edit this footage in a way that gives it a visual style distinct from the rest of your film (for instance, by muting the color palette). This way, it's easy for your audience to tell which footage is ""real"" and which is a recreation.

, As you film your documentary, keep a diary of how the filming went each day. Include any mistakes you made as well as any unexpected surprises you encountered. Also consider writing a brief outline for the next day of shooting. If an interview subject said something that makes you want to pursue a new angle for your film, note this. By keeping track of each day's events, you have a better chance of keeping on track and on schedule.


Once finished, do a paper edit viewing footage and making notes of shots to keep and others to discard.

, Now that you've collected all the footage for your documentary, you need to organize it in an order that is interesting, coherent, and will keep the viewers' attention. Make a detailed shot-by-shot outline to guide the editing process. Provide a coherent narrative for the audience to follow that proves your viewpoint. Decide which footage will go at the beginning, which will go in the middle, which will go at the end, and which won't go in the film at all. Showcase the most interesting footage, while cutting anything that seems meandering, boring, or pointless.


In our classic car documentary, we might start with exciting or amusing ride-along footage to ease the viewers into the world of classic car aficionados. We'd then dive into the opening credits, followed by interview footage, clips from car shows, etc.
The end of your documentary should be something that ties the film's information together in an interesting way and reinforces your key theme - this can be a striking final image or a great, memorable comment from an interview. In our car documentary, we might choose to end on footage of a beautiful classic car being scrapped for parts - a commentary on the fact that appreciation for classic cars is dying.

, Many documentaries use audio narration as a running thread throughout the film, linking the film's interview and real-life footage in a coherent narrative. You can record a voiceover yourself, enlist the help of a friend, or even hire a professional voice actor. Make sure your narration is clear, concise, and understandable.


Generally, an audio voiceover should play over footage where the audio isn't important - you don't want the audience to miss anything. Lay your voiceover over establishing shots, B-roll, or real-life footage where the audio isn't necessary to grasp the importance of what's going on.

, Some documentaries use static or animated graphics to convey facts, figures, and statistics directly to the viewer in the form of text. If your documentary is trying to prove a certain argument, you may want to make use of these to relay facts that prove your argument.


In our car documentary, we might want to use on-screen text to convey specific statistics about, for instance, declining membership in classic car clubs in Austin and nationwide.
Use these with restraint - don't constantly bombard your audience with textual and numerical data. It can be exhausting for the audience to have to read mountains of text, so use this direct method only for the most important information. A good rule of thumb is to, whenever possible, ""show, not tell.""


, Try to employ local musicians and musical talent in your projects. Avoid copyrighted music by creating your own. Or, you can find music on a public domain site or from a musician willing to share their talents.

, You have all the pieces - now it's time to put them all together! Use a commercial editing program to assemble your footage into a coherent film on your computer (many computers are now sold with basic video editing software.). Remove everything that doesn't logically fit into the theme of your film - for instance, you might remove the parts of your interviews that don't directly deal with your film's topic. Take your time during the editing process - allow yourself plenty of time to get it just right. When you think you're done, sleep on it, then watch the entire film again and make any other edits you think are necessary. Remember Ernest Hemingway's thoughts on first drafts.


Make your film as lean as possible, but be a reasonable and ethical editor. For instance, if, while filming, you encountered strong evidence that goes against your film's viewpoint, it's a little disingenuous to pretend it doesn't exist. Instead, modify the message of your film or, better yet, find a new counter-argument!

, After you've edited your film, you'll probably want to share it. After all, films were meant to be watched! Show your movie to someone you know - this can be a parent, a friend, or someone else whose opinion you trust. Then market your project as broadly as possible. Have a public screening rent, beg or borrow a venue to allow audiences to enjoy your work.


Get as many people involved as possible. For every person involved in your project, it translates to two people in the audience for the screening or to buy your documentary.
Send your documentary out to festivals but choose fests carefully. Pick ones that screen projects similar to yours.
Be prepared to get honest feedback. Ask your viewer(s) to review your movie. Tell them not to sugarcoat it - you want to know exactly what they liked and what they didn't like. According to what they tell you, you may choose go back to editing and fix what needs to be fixed. This can potentially (but not necessarily) mean re-shooting footage or adding new scenes.
Get used to rejection and toughen up. After investing countless hours in your documentary, you expect audiences to react and respond. Don't be disappointed if they aren't ""over the moon"" about your project; we tend live in a media-consumptive world today and audiences have high expectations and low tolerance.

, When your film is finally exactly how you want it and as good as you think it can possibly be, it's time to show it off. Invite your friends and family over to watch the final cut and ""meet the director."" If you're bold, you can even upload your movie to a free streaming site (like YouTube) and share it via social media or other online means of distribution.

, If you think you have a top notch documentary on your hands, you should try to give it a theatrical release. Often, the first place a new independent film will be screened is at a film festival. Look for festivals near where you live. Often, these will be in large cities, but some are occasionally held in smaller towns. Enter your film in a festival for a chance at getting it shown. Usually, you will have to provide a copy of your film and pay a small fee. If your film is selected out of the pool of applicants, it will be shown at the festival. Films with good ""festival buzz"" - that is, festival films that are particularly well-received - are sometimes bought by film distribution companies for a wider release!


Film festivals also offer a chance for you to gain visibility as a director. At film festivals, directors often are asked to talk about themselves and their film in panel discussions and Q&A sessions.

, Making a documentary can be a long, arduous process, but it can also be an immensely rewarding one. Shooting a documentary film gives you the chance to entertain and captivate an audience while simultaneously educating it. Moreover, documentaries offer filmmakers a rare chance to change the world in a very real way. A great documentary can illuminate an oft-ignored societal problem, change the way certain people and events are perceived, and even lead to changes in the way society operates. If you're having difficulty finding the motivation or inspiration to make your own documentary, consider watching and/or researching any of the influential documentaries listed below. Some of these were (and still are) seen as divisive and/or highly controversial - a good documentary film maker welcomes controversy!

Slowly pour the hot candy into the baking sheet.,
Place the baking sheet onto an even surface and let the candy harden.,
Remove the hardened candy from the baking sheet.",How to Make Sugar Glass1," The baking sheet needs to have raised sides, or the melted sugar will slide off. If you don't have cooking spray, wrap the inside of the sheet with tin foil or parchment paper.;
, Place the pot on the stove. You must use light corn syrup, or the glass will turn out too dark.








, The sugar will boil too quickly if you do, and start to caramelize. Stir the ingredients often so that you don't scorch the bottom of the pot. As the the mixture heats up, it'll go from a cloudy color to clear. When it boils, it will start to form foamy bubbles at top.









A silicone spatula will make clean up a lot easier than a wooden, plastic, or metal one.

, You can find one in a baking and cooking supply shop, an arts and crafts shop, or in the baking section of a super market. You will need this to get the temperature of your candy.









If your candy thermometer does not have a clip, tie it loosely to the handle of the pot with a piece of string.

, The candy must reach 300°F (148.89°C). This is known as the ""hard crack"" phase.If you do not get the candy hot enough, it will not set properly. Your candy will end up sticky no matter how long you let it sit or cool.It will take about an hour for the candy to reach the right temperature.


The temperature will stop rising for a moment somewhere between 210 and 240°F (98.89 and 115.56°C). This is because the water is evaporating. Once the water has evaporated, the temperature will begin rising again.
Keep the temperature between 300 and 310°F (148.89 and 154.45°C). Do not allow it to reach 320°F (160°C) or your sugar glass will caramelize and turn brown.If you do not have a candy thermometer, test the candy by dropping a tiny amount into a glass of cold water. The candy has reached the ""hard crack"" phase if it hardens into threads., This will minimize any bubbles. The candy will be thick, and spread slowly across the baking sheet.








, This will help the candy spread out evenly so that the finished glass is smooth and not lumpy. Leave the candy to dry for about an hour.









Don't move the candy until the full hour has passed. It will be be cool to the touch after 45 minutes, but it won't be hardened.

, If you used a cooking spray, flip the baking sheet upside down over a table. The candy should simply fall out. If you used tin foil or parchment paper, pop the candy out of the baking sheet. Then, peel the foil or paper off of the candy. If your candy does not come away easily, do this:









Take a knife and heat it up under hot water.
Cut along the edge where the glass meets the edge of the pan.
Use the knife to carefully loosen the candy from the baking sheet.
Flip the baking sheet over, then slowly lift the sheet away from the sugar glass that is resting on your hand.

Sugar sea glass is different from basic sugar glass. It is colored and frosted, just like real sea glass.

, Place the pot on the stove, and stir everything together. Try to use a silicone spatula; it will make cleaning up easier.








, Make sure to stir often, or the bottom of the pot may scorch. The mixture will be a little cloudy at first, but it will eventually turn clear.








, Do not use high heat, or the candy will boil too quickly and caramelize. As the candy boils, it will create foam-like bubbles.








, You will need it to gauge the temperature of your candy. You can get one in a baking or cooking supply shop, an arts and crafts shop, or in the baking department of a well-stocked super market.









If your candy thermometer doesn't have a clip, tie it to the handle of the pot with a piece of string. This way, it won't fall into your candy.

, This is very important. If you don't get your mixture hot enough, it won't harden properly. Your candy will be soft and sticky, no matter how long you let it sit, harden, or cool. It will take about an hour for it to reach this stage.


Do not let the temperature to reach 320°F (160°C) or your sugar glass will start to caramelize and turn brown.If you don't have a candy thermometer, drop a small amount into a glass of cold water. If the candy hardens into threads, it has reached the ""hard crack"" phase.

, You will only need a few drops of food coloring. The more drops you add, the darker your sea glass will be. The color you use is up to you, but most sea glass is green or blue. You can also leave your sea glass clear; it will become more white once you add the powdered sugar. Use only one flavor and color per batch.









Consider matching your flavoring to the color. For example, you can use blueberry flavoring for blue sea glass, mint flavoring for green glass, and vanilla flavoring for white/clear glass.You can buy the coloring and flavoring in the baking section of an arts and crafts store. You may also find them in a store that sells baking and cooking supplies.

, The color should be even. There should not be any streaks or swirls. The candy will be translucent. This is normal. You will be making it cloudy in a later step.








, Try to get the entire surface of the baking sheet covered. The candy will be thick and syrupy. It will take about an hour for it to harden.








, Cover the candy with a towel or dish cloth. Then, use a hammer to shatter it into smaller pieces. Tape the candy in several places with the hammer.








, This will give it that frosted look that real sea glass has. You can also fill a plastic sandwich bag with some powdered sugar, add in a piece pieces of candy, and shake it.

Use blue and clear glass for a winter themed party.,
Use red, orange, and yellow sugar glass shards to create flames on cupcakes and cakes.,
Serve sugar sea glass on some brown sugar and crushed graham crackers to mimic a beach.,
Use clear sugar glass and red gel frosting to top creepy cupcakes.,
Use sugar glass to make windows for a gingerbread house.,

Give the shards away as party favors.",How to Make Sugar Glass3," Make some sugar sea glass, but do not coat the shards with powdered sugar. Leave them colored, but translucent.

, Make some sugar sea glass, but do not coat the shards with powdered sugar. Leave them translucent. Try making the yellow shards the largest, and the red shards the smallest. Coat a cake or cupcake with some buttercream frosting, and stick the shards into the frosting.


You will need to make a separate batch of candy for each color.

, Crumble the crackers into a fine powder and mix it together with some brown sugar. Spread this on a shallow dish and top it with some sugar sea glass. You can also add some white chocolate sea shells.If you can't find any graham crackers, any thin, cinnamon, honey, or ginger flavored cookies will do.

, Frost some cupcakes with white, buttercream frosting. Stick some clear, sugar glass shards into the frosting. Dribble some red gel/writing frosting over the top edges of the sugar glass.


This is perfect for a scary Halloween party.

, Place your gingerbread house walls on a sheet of parchment paper. Pour the melted candy into the window holes. Wait at one hour for the candy to harden. Gently pry the walls off the parchment paper. The candy will be hardened inside the window holes.Use icing to draw a frame around the window. You can also use icing to draw a # or + over the window to create a lattice.
To create a stained glass look: use icing to glue different colored shards of hardened sugar glass behind a window opening.
If your gingerbread house does not have window holes: put some square-shaped cookie cutters onto a sheet of parchment paper. Fill them with melted sugar glass. Wait one hour for the candy to harden, then pop it out of the cookie cutter. Use icing to glue the squares to a gingerbread house wall., Make several batches of sugar glass, each in a different color. Smash them into shards with a hammer. Cover a cake with some buttercream icing, then stick the shards against the sides of the cake.

, Choose some clear cellophane bags that match the theme of your party. Fill each one with a few shards of sugar glass. Tie the bag off with a ribbon that matches the bag.


Clear white and clear blue sugar glass are perfect for a winter-themed party. You can also include tiny, sugar snowflake sprinkles in the bag as well.
Sugar sea glass is perfect for a beach-themed party. Try dropping some chocolate seashells into the bag as well.

",How to Start Filmmaking As a Kid," It should probably stay under five pages, since you probably don't have enough time or money to afford a three hour epic. Keep it small. Scripts have particular formats, but you just need to separate dialogue (what characters say) from action.;
, The hardest thing to get is a camera. Try asking your parents if they have one, and if you can use it. If they don't, move on to other family members, like aunts, uncles, grandparents, etc. If they don't have one, try asking your friends. You're bound to find something.

, Your cast can just be a couple of friends who like acting. Try asking around your school's drama club. Try to find your best friends for the crew, or people with lots of patience, because the crew, or the people who help out behind the camera, are usually stuck doing the mundane tasks, like holding the script, lugging equipment around everywhere and getting the actors water.

, For props and costumes, look through your wardrobe, garage/attic, and friends' wardrobes. Try to shoot near your house, or in public property. It's harder to get people's permission for shooting by their house.

, Don't try for the perfect take. Once things are as good as they'll get, move to the next location.

, This is either the most tiring part or the most enjoyable, depending on what your film demands. Most computers nowadays come with editing software built in. Learn how yours works. iMovie is an amazing tool that is easy for a kid to use, but creates professional menus, transitions, and seamless cuts.

, Invite everyone who helped make the movie over for a premiere screening. Send the movie to film competitions and festivals, and get it seen. If you can't do this then, assuming you have the cast's permission, release the film onto an online video sharing website.

Send thank-you letters.",How to Create a Good Public Service Announcement Film," A public service announcement is an educational message intended to raise awareness about a topic that serves the public. The goal is to motivate viewers to change their behavior or attitude about the topic in the film through persuasion and facts., The most important decision you have to make is selecting a topic for your PSA film. Think about who your audience is and be sure your topic is relevant to them. There are several questions to consider to make sure your topic is specific and meaningful.What key message are you trying to convey? Does this message service the public’s interest in a significant way? Is it new and important? Why?Can you announce your message in a minute or less?Who is your audience? What specific action do you want them to take after seeing your film?What might your audience already know about your topic, and what should they know? How can you include this in your call-to-action?, It is worth emphasizing that you need to know exactly who your audience is. The group you are trying to reach needs to be as specific as possible. Demographics should be considered in planning your PSA.One major demographic category you may want to think about is age groups (children, teenagers, young adults, adults, senior citizens).
Other demographic categories to consider are gender, education level, religion, political affiliation, income level, or race/ethnicity.

, Once you know your topic spend time researching it. You are now an authority on the topic so make sure you back your claims up with credible sources. Collect data, facts, and statements that can support passionate scenes and memorable dialogue.Gather as many statistics and hard data as you can about your topic.If you are not sure about any of your research, have someone else fact-check it for you., Even though you are not paying for airtime, creating a PSA film can be expensive. This is another piece of preparation that will depend on several questions. Planning a budget will help you get an idea of how much you can afford and what to focus on before you get started.Are you going to need any well-known figures (celebrities, politicians, or community leaders)? You may have to pay them for their time, but having their face on your film can persuade people to pay attention.Are you paying for a studio? If so, how many days will you need? How many crewmembers? Will you need specialty film equipment?How many actors will you be hiring? Are they union, or non-union? Are you using a talent agency to hire them? What about the post-production team (like editors)?If your PSA is for a student project you may have to budget for equipment rentals or common area spaces to film your project., You know you want to create a PSA. Now you need to decide how you will get your message across to your audience. Your topic is an important one and you will need to grab your audience’s attention and hold it. Plan out a general idea of how you want your PSA to look, sound, and feel.


The first question to ask yourself is how you want to convey your message. Do you want to use humor? Do you want to create a sense or urgency or emergency? Do you want to use graphic images or bright colors to catch their attention? Do you want to incite specific feelings, like sadness, before delving into your message?You should also ask yourself if you want to appeal to authority. Should you invite famous or influential people to deliver your message for you? Will that help your audience pay attention more?Do you want to address expected objections in your film? You may be able to guess reactions people will have to your message. You can address them before they have a chance to object. It shows you have thought of everything., Make sure your PSA is an issue that is currently relevant to your audience. They will not be motivated to take action if the message does not affect them in any way. The addressed problem needs to be current, relevant, and profound. You should also strive to include some racial diversity in your PSA, so it can reach a large range of viewers., It is important that you hold the audience’s attention throughout the duration of your PSA film. You can do this using dramatic music and shock tactics, or humorous vignettes. One famous PSA used the demise of cat videos being the result of smoking., By the time the audience watches your PSA film they should be motivated to take the action you are persuading them to take. Your film needs to capture them and give specific instructions on how they can help make a difference right away., Find as many ways to repeat your message as you can in your PSA film. You can repeat your message in spoken dialogue, narration, written words, or even in the lyrics of music. Your message can also be implied in the scenes or actor's actions.. There are a variety of ways to achieve this goal. The point is to make sure your audience hears or sees the main message many times so they remember it., To get an idea of what a good PSA film looks like, take some time to watch several examples of classic PSA films that have reputations for being effective or well received. They can give you ideas on how to model your own film.

The Ad Council has released a fair number of popular PSA films. Their gallery is a good one to reference., It is important to know what makes an ineffective PSA so you know what to keep out of your film. This information will be helpful in both the creation and editing process of your film. Keep a keen eye out for these markers.Avoid using gimmicks that nobody will remember, like an overly long slogan. Keep slogans short and to-the-point, if you use them. In some cases, rhyming can help people remember a slogan, but it is not necessary all the time.
Keep stereotypes or other offensive material out of your film.
Do not victim blame or portray other dangerous social stereotypes.

, Before making a detailed storyboard of your PSA, create an outline of the film’s flow. Identify key scenes and characters. Come up with a hook or catch phrase. Write it all out using a basic outline format that you can change and edit. Brainstorm with your colleagues using your outline.The outline includes things like setting and location, and film style. Do you want it to be a narrated story? An interview? A flashback? A dream? How do you want to send your message?How many scenes or shots will you include in your film? This is going to be important in your editing phase.Decide how long you want the film to be and what tone you want the PSA to have (funny, serious, fearful, sad)., Using the notes from your outline, write the dialogue (narration) for your PSA film, for each scene. Use conversational language, with your facts inserted into it. The language should include your hook and emotional statements that get attention.You can create a multi-column script if you are filming two versions of your film. One column will have dialogue for the 30-second version, the other will have dialogue for the 60-second version.Read your script out loud and time it to make sure it fits into the allotted 30-second time limit., Using your outline and script, create a storyboard of your film. The storyboard includes sketches of each scene, with detailed descriptions underneath the sketch. It is a visual representation of your outline. You can also include pieces of script in the details under your sketches.For a 30-second PSA film, you should have about four to six sketches on your storyboard., It is helpful to know what kind of camera equipment you will need to shoot your film, especially if you are not hiring a production company to shoot it for you. You will need to know what camera you need and what angles to shoot each scene in., Using your storyboard, create a shot list. A shot list is a spreadsheet that describes every shot of your film. It includes locations, characters, camera angle, the description of the shot, and dialogue. This is the final step in mapping out what your scenes are going to look like. It is also useful for scheduling studio time., If you are shooting the film yourself you will need to rent a studio and set it up. By now you should know how many days of studio time you need because your storyboard has that mapped out. You should also know what equipment you need., Shooting a film is a big project. You are fighting for airtime so you want your PSA to look great. It will take the collaboration of a team of people to make that happen. Schedule tasks ahead of time so there is no confusion when you get to the studio and start shooting.If you are hiring a professional production company they will do this for you., Spend one day going through the shot list with your cast and rehearsing the dialogue. Make sure they memorize their lines and the crew knows where they should be. This way the production process will go by smoother with less necessary editing.This is a good time to test your lights. Lighting is important to the visual quality of a film. You can take this opportunity to make sure the lighting looks exactly how you want it to look. When you get to the studio the next day it will already be in place., Go through your scenes again, filming this time. Make sure you film each shot several times, from different angles. Be a perfectionist. This is an important project that needs to look exactly as you envision it., Whether it is your studio or a rented space, you should clean up after yourself. Return any rented equipment, replace anything you moved, and clean anything you made dirty. As you now know, shooting a film is cumbersome. Cleaning up after the person before you is the last thing you want to deal with.

, Editing a film is a lot of work that requires a specialized skill. If your budget is low and you cannot afford an editor, you can tackle the editing process yourself. Otherwise, hiring a professional editor will save you a lot of time and effort.If you decide to edit the film yourself, you will need to decide what editing software to use. There are many good options available., This is the step where you match the visual scenes to the audio. If you want to include any external audio cues (like narration), you can add that audio during this step., This is your first round of cuts. Go through all the shots and cut materials you don’t think are pertinent to the bigger picture of the film. Remember that your film can only be 30 (or 60) seconds long so you will end up doing a lot of scene cutting., After going through each shot of your footage and deciding which scenes can stay and which scenes have to go, you should have a final version that fits into your allotted time slot. You can add sound effects and music as the last step., Save your final cut as a master file for yourself. Be sure to back it up, twice. This is your file, not the file you will give to the television broadcasters. They will request different formats., Since television stations are giving you free airtime, do not automatically expect to get a slot at your first choice. Television spots are competitive so it helps if you know someone at the station who can vouch for you.Some television stations have PSA directors who are responsible for placing PSA films. Check to see if your choice station has a person like that.Consider the audience of the station. Is it the same audience you are trying to reach with your PSA?, Do not just send the file of your PSA film to stations. Reach out to them by phone and introduce yourself first. Tell them what your goals with the film are and ask who you should be speaking with.If they show initial interest, ask to meet with someone in person.They might ask you to send a copy of your PSA film. Make sure you know what file format they want the film in., Meet with someone at the station (or talk with them over the phone) and give them a one or two minute pitch about your PSA film’s goals and call-to-action. Tell them why your PSA is relevant to their station’s audience., For example, if your PSA is healthcare related, reach out to a local healthcare agency before they host or sponsor a community event and ask if your organization can attend. Show your PSA film at the event. In return, you can mention their name somewhere in your booth or on the film., When your PSA film airs, send thank-you letters to everyone involved. Send them to key staff at the station aired your film, as well as anyone who aided in getting your PSA out to the public."

Remember to keep it short. It will take months to shoot a three-hour epic.



 

;
, Explore different locations and find out what works. Equipment is usually difficult to obtain. You probably know someone who owns a camera, so ask around and see if they'll lend one to you. It doesn't matter whether the camera is brand new or twenty years old. Just get something that records moving images. For actors, you can just ask your friends if they want to be in a movie, and odds are, they'll say yes.

, When you shoot your movie, make sure you're at least somewhat prepared and know what your movie's about. You don't want to take too long, so remember to stop shooting as soon as the take is as good as it's going to get. Pay attention to what's in the frame; if you're shooting a futuristic space adventure, you don't want your mom doing dishes in the background. Once you've shot your movie, it's editing time!

, Depending on your camcorder, this could be as easy as plugging the camera into the computer or having to use a digitizing board. Most computers nowadays come with an editing system you can load your movie onto. If not, there's an external link to a free, basic movie editor on the bottom of this page.

, Once your clips are imported- start editing by selecting the shots you want from the bin and putting them onto the timeline. Read the manual for your particular editing system.

, Drag all the files, one by one, down in the order you desire. Play it through a couple of times, improve the order, cut some of the clips, and play again. When you're satisfied, add some effects and transitions (You can probably see, where to access these. If not, find the help menu). Again try your way through the options.

, Background music is key.

, It does not have to be perfect.

, Ask your friends to be the actors, because getting real actors will most likely be hard.

, It could be a camcorder, digital camera, flip, a webcam on your computer, or a real directors' camera. Get a camera that films in 720p or above (1280x720 or above).


Make sure you know the camera like the back of your hand before you go to the shoot. A DSLR camera is recommended if you have the money. But don't spend too much money on a camera if you're not going to get a decent one. Don't expect the cheapest DSLR to have good movie recording features.

, You won't be able to shoot all your scenes on a green screen, so you could build sets or shoot on location like a local park.

, If you do that, your movie will be a success.

, If it doesn't work, try again.

, Keep on trying.

, You might need some people that are willing to do stunts, as stunt doubles.


Chances are you don't have a lot of money so unfortunately you can't get real stuntmen. And not a lot of people are willing to be stunt doubles, as no one is willing to do stunts and not have their faces shown (unless they get paid). Real stunt men are trained professionals, your friends are not!

, See how it looks.

, Watch through all your takes with your editor (unless you're the one editing it) and decide which takes you're going to use.


Try not to use Windows Movie Maker, as it will have hugely annoying lagging footage. Try to get your hands on Adobe Premiere Pro/Elements. If you have a lot of violence in your movie you may also want to invest in Adobe After Effects.

, You can send it to real production companies, but it's most likely they'll turn you down.


If you want send your movie to theaters (they'll most likely turn you down as well), or if you have a home theater do it there, or just get it on DVD with Windows Live Movie Maker, and show it on your TV with your DVD player, Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox One or Blu-Ray.

You might want to make it really original, like the Great Sith War or the New Republic. You can also visit many different places for different planets, or just make one in the setting.


A Jedi could be walking around the neighborhood then attacked by two Sith. Or, you could make the story more complicated by putting it before or after the movies, or even in between.;
, Humor will improve the amateur movie, allowing for much forgiveness for the amateur setting and storyline! Add few jokes and punch lines to your movie. It wouldn't be a good one without it. Make sure that you understand people's styles, and make the humor fit to each of them.


Make your own funny scenes. For example:

Rebel 1 and rebel 2 are walking.
Rebel 1 collapses.
Rebel 2 calls his commanding officer.
Rebel 2: ""Sir, my partner collapsed and is not breathing, what should I do?""
Commander: ""Make sure he is dead, then tell me.""
Rebel 2 shoots rebel 1.
Rebel 2: "" Now what?"".


Make a parody of the original movies. Parody is both fun and clever. Creating a parody script will teach you a lot about analyzing and writing.

, You'll need this for the actors to follow and to know that your film has a fully fledged storyline.

, You'll need at least one set to film against.


If you live near a city or in one you could make it in Coruscant (see episode 1,2,3).
If you live in woods, it would be a good idea to make the movie in Kashyyk (see Episode 3) or Endor (see Episode 6).
If you live in a place like Arizona (desert), you could make it on Tatooine (see Episodes 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6).
If in the mountains, make it on Hoth (see Episode 5). Or, if you live in the mountains with either forest or snow (never use both, unless you are creating your own planet), you can make forest moons like Endor or Yavin 4, or ice planets like Hoth.
If you have a big field, you could make it Naboo (see Episode 1 or 2).
If you live near a swamp, make it Dagobah (episode 5).

, Do not just film the thing with toy lightsabers and guns and make swoosh sounds with your mouth. Download Lsmaker or FXhome visionlab Studio (both have a lightsaber effects program). Add other sound effects from the internet.

, You can play it on your guitar but you can make it better by adding the real deal. You can get music from the internet as well.

, This will depend on your budget and computer type; do the research to get the best for what you can afford.

, Remember how Harrison Ford (aka, Han Solo) flew the Millenium Falcon in circles just to lose the Imperials in that asteroid field in ""The Empire Strikes Back?"" Well, to get characters with a good personality like Solo, you need actors with an equally good personality.


Don't try to use characters from the movies too much, they won't anything like the real thing at all (unless you have a really good makeup artist), and people will get confused. Try to make your own characters, or try to make the character you know and love from a different time (for example, you could make someone Luke Skywalker when he was growing up on Tatooine).
Droids are recommended, but optional. If you decide to use droids, you can get some costumes, and if the color of it doesn't fit you, you can either bleach it or tie-dye it.

, Get people who are happy with the camera, directing actors, making costumes, doing makeup, writing scripts, editing on the computer, etc. Wherever you have strengths, take on the role, otherwise find others to help you.

, Include a lot of popcorn. And let it roll.

Create a script.,
Buy props and costumes.,
Hire actors.,
Shoot the film.,
Upload the film.",How to Make an Indiana Jones Fan Film," Any good Indiana Jones (fan) film relies on one thing––a strong script. Make sure to include these things:


A strong introduction. All Indiana Jones films are renowned for their strong introductions, like the boulder scene or the hunt for the Cross of Coronado. Make sure that the introduction is separate from the rest of the plot (the only film that got away with this was Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, but only because the objects the Soviets were looking for had something to do with the climax of the movie).
An original story: All Indiana Jones films (excluding the fourth, an exception on all levels) follow a non-linear storyline that have nothing to do with the other. You can put references in from the original films, but don't put too many or it will come off as corny.
An artifact to go after: Indy always has to have these, or there's no story. You can include a historical one, or create a completely new one. Keep it along the lines of religious or extraterrestrial artifacts.
A time period: Anywhere between the late 1920s to the early 1960s is ideal.
A villain: If you're going to set it in the 1920s, make it gangsters or tomb robbers. Starting in late 1933, you can include Nazis. During the War Years, you can put Nazis, Imperial Japanese, or Fascist Italians. If it's after the war, put in Soviets or even Cubans. If you decide to, you can create a cult or a rival archaeologist like Belloq.;
, This is a top priority. Of course, you don't have hundred million dollar budgets like Spielberg and Lucas do, but you must have a little money to spare.


Stick to the basics. Buy Indy's whip and revolver first. If you have more money, buy a few more props like guns or rent vehicles. You can buy Indiana Jones costumes relatively cheap online.

, Okay, here's where it gets a bit tricky. You can make yourself Indy and ask friends for help. However, if you want a quality film, you can always recruit a few professional actors for pay., After everything has been put in order, shoot your film. You can choose a variety of settings to shoot your film, from your bedroom and backyard to film sets.

, Again, this is totally optional. Once you are done making your film, you can upload it on YouTube or any other video site and wait for the views to roll in. This step is optional.

Make a list of all the stuff you are needing and how much money you are planning to spend.","How to Direct, Act, and Create a Good Movie (Kids and Teens)1"," To help you get a good idea, think what things you like to do. If you love to play sports and you are in a baseball team, make a movie about that. Or perhaps you like dogs, so you could make a movie about a dog. Also, think about what type of stories you like and what message you want to give the audience. There are many types of stories: love stories, action and superheroes, accidents, friendship, competition, comedy,... Do some research about the topic of your story too. If you are making a movie about the gold fever in California, go to a museum, search online...;
, When you hand them out if it doesn't have many details a person could imagine it way different from you. To avoid that problem you should make a storyboard (next step).

, A storyboard is a comic of the script. It shows what happens in every scene, but it's not very detailed. It needs to show what place they are at, the character's positions, what they are doing. If drawing is not your thing, don't worry. You can still make your movie look good without this.

, They can be friends or family, but make sure that they are going to take it seriously and that they are not quitting on you. It might ruin all your job. If an actor isn't comfortable, or embarrassed with his part, don't make him do it. Otherwise the acting won't be as good, and there might be more possibilities that he quits on you.

, It might be really bad if the filming day comes and you don't have the costumes.

Put friends or willing musicians behind the scene if you'd like; it can sound clearer, sharper, and crisper that way.","How to Direct, Act, and Create a Good Movie (Kids and Teens)2"," If you have a lot of people in your movie it might be hard to choose a day when you can all meet. Make a schedule of how much time you are spending in a scene and what people you are needing, because if someone doesn't act one day it's silly that he comes (unless he has to do something else, such as being the camera man).

Note: It's always better if you use the program that comes with the camera. Sometimes you can't edit the videos with another program if you don't save them with the program that comes with the camera first. These type of programs aren't usually very good, unless it's an expensive camera. Plus you can edit your movie with as many programs as you like, until you get good results. If you filmed it with a green screen, there are some programs that can edit those type of videos. When buying one, get well-informed about what the program can do.

If you can't add credits and a title, you can paint the letters with the program Paint that all computers have, and save it as an image. So when putting it all together just include that.

Your resources include everything from a location to script writing software to actors. Embrace your limitations. Use what you have to help you come up with an idea for a movie you could make using what’s at your disposal. Compile a list of everything that you have available to you. Think outside the box. If you are at a film school, you’ll most likely have access to high-quality cameras, lighting and sound equipment. If you’re not, you may have to borrow stuff or use what you have. When making a short movie, it’s ok to use the camera on your phone, as long as it’s a decent camera. Don’t worry so much about lighting and sound right now. While these elements are important, if you don’t have access to such equipment, write a script that won’t have you needing it.
Think about your own wardrobe and your friends’. You probably won’t need to get costumes. You can wear your own clothes.;
, With a list of all the resources you have to use, come up with a great movie idea.


You can brainstorm alone or with a group of your friends. If you’re making this movie together, you should include everyone.
Write your ideas down on paper or on a whiteboard. Discuss and collaborate with your friends on the ideas you come up with.
At this stage of brainstorming, no idea is bad or stupid. Once you have plenty of ideas, then you can start narrowing down. Try combining multiple ideas.
When coming up with an idea for your movie, be realistic about what you can do with what you have. And with short movies by ammeter filmmakers, making a comedy will be easier.
If you want to make a movie about being in space, but don’t have a green screen and a budget for visual effects you may have to rethink your idea. Maybe you can be in space but decide that the movie will be shot entirely in one room you make to look like the inside of a spaceship.

, Once you have your brilliant idea in place, it’s time to write your script.


There are some things to note about writing a script for a movie. Roughly one page of your script equals one minute of film in your movie. For your short movie, you should not try to film something longer than ten minutes. Three to five minutes is best. To write your script, you can use a script editing software like Highland, or Final Draft. However, these programs cost money and can be expensive. You can also write a script in a simple word processor like Google Docs. There are even some script writing extensions you can use to format it correctly. , With your script in hand now it’s time to create a detailed plan of how you will shoot and produce your film.


Create a schedule that you can follow. It should include dates and times for gathering all your equipment. Times for auditioning and casting your actors. And times for filming, and editing.
You should talk to everyone who is helping you make this movie. Together find dates and times when you can film and plan for everything you need to do before you film. If you are renting or borrowing any equipment, know when you can get it and when you have to return it.
Plan a day to find the locations of your film before you start shooting. If you are planning to shoot somewhere public you may have to get permission first. Plan when you’ll have the costumes and set ready. You should dedicate days to these types of tasks so that when it’s time to film, you don’t have to worry about missing anything.

, If you are making this short movie with a group of friends, you may not need to audition any actors. You can just use yourselves.


Regardless of how you get your actors you need to assign everyone a role. And make sure that the actors are available on the days you plan to shoot.
Give your actors the script with enough time for the actors to memorize lines.

, Depending on how much equipment you have and how involved your scenes are, a breakdown can be very helpful. A breakdown is an itemized list of all the equipment, props, costumes, etc.


There are several types of breakdowns when it comes to making a movie. But for a short movie, a producer’s breakdown is best.
The producer’s breakdown covers five main areas: Where is the location you are shooting? Does the scene take place during the day or at night? Which characters are in the scene? What props are needed? How many pages is this scene? For your short movie, you may not need the last part of the breakdown. But if you are filming multiple scenes it may be useful.
You may want to storyboard. A storyboard is like a comic book drawing of each and every shot. It details how the camera will move, when the cut will happen, and includes details on the scene. It’s your preference if you think this will help. You may prefer just having an idea in your head.

, Once you have everyone on board, have made your breakdown, and have planned your days it’s time to finalize a shooting schedule.


Your breakdown will help you plan when the actors need to be where and when you can film what. Since you’re making a short movie, you may plan to shoot everything in one or two days.
Coming up with a finalized schedule using all the information you have will allow you to decide what you can get done when. Something to note, filming almost always takes longer than you plan. Give yourself a buffer zone.

, Before you shoot your actual movie, you’ll want to do some equipment testing so you don’t have any hiccups on the day.


Even if you’re using your phone’s camera, make sure you’re familiar with all the options you have. Do some research on whichever camera or camera app you are using and learn how to adjust the lighting, the zoom, etc.
If you are using light or sound equipment, test it out and do some test shots. Make sure that you know how to use the mics and how to position the lights for your desired results.
Make sure that everything is charged and you have backup batteries ready for any equipment on the days you shoot.

, Before you actually shoot your scene, have your actors rehearse it a couple of times.


You can choose to film some of the rehearsal if you want, but the goal is to make sure your actors know the lines.
This rehearsal time is also a good opportunity for you to make sure your shots are set up correctly. As well as make sure your actors are portraying the characters the way you envisioned.
If you need to talk with the actors about a line or the way a character is being portrayed, be respectful. Don’t tell actors how to do something or how to deliver a line. Express what your vision is and discuss what you want.

, With your equipment all set up and the actors ready, it’s time to hit record and shoot your movie. Aim to short the bigger and more important stuff first.


While filming you may come up with a new idea or see that something isn’t working and want to change it. That’s ok. But try to follow any storyboard you may have or plan you’ve discussed as best as you can.
If something needs to be changed, for example, if you can’t fit everyone in the frame the way you wanted, you can make adjustments. But try not to completely change your plan at the last minute. Doing so could put you behind schedule and not everyone may agree with you.
Once you start recording, make sure that everyone on set other than the actors in the scene are extremely quiet.

, After you do your first take, it’s a great idea to do more. You want several options to play with when editing.


Doing a couple of takes will also give you the opportunity to make small adjustments or get a slightly different angle on a shot.
You can also use this opportunity to let your actors explore a little more with certain choices or delivery.

, Once you’ve shot all the important stuff first, go over your breakdowns and your schedule and see what else you need.


You may want to get some secondary footage like an exterior shot. Or you might want to use this opportunity to get some close-up shots of faces or objects.
Additionally, if you had to reschedule or didn’t know if a certain shot or scene was necessary, now is your opportunity to potentially include it.

, Use an editing software to edit your movie together and make it a complete product. Editing software is usually included with your computer. Though you can purchase more comprehensive software like Adobe Premiere Pro. However, these programs are usually expensive.


If you have a friend who knows how to edit and has an editing software, this person can be a good resource. Editing takes time and sometimes having someone who didn’t shoot and direct the movie can give you a great product.
Whether you edit your movie on your own or enlist the help of someone is up to you. When editing, it’s a good idea to name your files in a way that will allow you to easily identify which is which.
With your short movie, remember that less can be more. Cut anything that doesn't add to the value of the overall storyline and film quality. Add effects, music, etc., as required.
Once you like the final edit, export your movie. You can export your film for YouTube, Vimeo, or even just to have on your computer.

, Depending on your reason for making a short movie, you may want to promote it.


If you’re making a movie as part of a class and plan to show it, you might want to make movie posters to put up around your school. Include when and where you’ll be showing it so people can come.
If you plan to send your short movie to any film festivals or competitions, you may even want to make a Facebook page for your film and invite your friends to like it.
If you just made this movie for fun you can still make a poster for fun and plan a premiere night where you all gather to watch it. You can also promote it on social media and tell your friends to stay tuned for the release. Then you can plan to upload your movie to YouTube or Vimeo when it’s complete.

, Before you premiere your short movie, you should show your current cut to a couple of people you trust to give you any notes.


These could be people who were involved in making the movie or someone who’s opinion you simply value.
Take any notes you are given politely. You don’t have to make any changes if you don’t want to. But a second pair of eyes may help you identify something you missed.

, Once your movie is final and exported, you can premiere it.


Either show it through your class or at a festival. Or simply gather your friends and family and make a night of it at home. You can even throw a small party to congratulate and thank everyone for being involved.
When it’s time to show the movie make some popcorn. Turn down the lights like you’re in a movie theater and hit play.
After you’ve premiered it, you can upload it to the web so that others can enjoy it.

Be realistic.,
Gather a few friends (at least 5) and brainstorm ideas.,
Find or make suitable costumes.,
Decide where to shoot the movie.,
Choose a designated director.",How to Create a Low Budget Movie (for Kids)1," Because of the budget, don't expect this movie to be the greatest thing in film history. However, in spite of technical limitations, your imagination has none, so be open minded about what you can do. As long as it isn't extremely boring, your movie will be hilarious because of how ""bad"" it is.;
, Horror/action/mystery movies are always fun. Make up some random collaboration of aliens, zombies, ghosts, vampires, murderers, cops, superheroes, spies, etc.


Select the characters. Most every film has a star (or a few), a villain (or a few), a comic relief person who might also be a bit dimwitted, annoying or vain
Bonus: The movie can even have a plot; this will take a bit longer to work through but can make it more enjoyable to watch.

, Root through your old clothes from Halloween, or just look in your dresser.


Sheets can make good ghosts and capes.
If you don't have a full body suit made out of aluminum for an alien, just wear some pants on your head and shoes on your hands.
Cardboard boxes can be cut and colored to look like all sorts of things from robots to crocodiles.
Ask adults for their clothes (but make sure they know what the clothes are being used for, in case the clothes get damaged).

, Big parks with forests work well as they have plenty of space and lots of possibilities. The garden or back yard of your own home can also be suitable.


If you want to shoot inside, you'll need to know how to control the lighting well. This requires a bit more learning but can be a good idea, especially during the colder months or when it's raining.
Crowded cities aren't always great because people can walk in front of you. Or, they might distract your actors too much by staring.
If you have scenes where people a beating each other up or having a gunfight, bystanders might call the police. Choose a private place to shoot such scenes, or place big signs up saying ""filming in progress"" to reassure people.

, The director shouldn't come into the shots. In the case of lack of helpers, this person should control the camera.


The director should know exactly what they want the actors to do and be the one calling (and filming) all the shots.

"
"
Know some shooting technique dos and don'ts.,
To simulate a person traveling a bit, switch shots like the person walking away, then a shot of them coming towards you, then from the side.

,
Ensure that all of the acting cast is aware that they must wait for the director to say action and cut at the beginning and end of each scene.,
Repeatedly film a shot until you get it almost exactly as you want it.,
When editing a video, only choose the best take of each shot.",How to Create a Low Budget Movie (for Kids)2,"


Shot Level 1: Filming from above: This technique reduces the status and stature of the actor being filmed and is not always recommended.
Shot Level 2: Filming from below: This often used technique raises the on screen status. If the actor's feet are spread and firm on the ground, it gives him more power and strength.
Shot Move 1: Zoom in: Used to focus in on one aspect or when an actor has an important thing they are saying/doing.
Shot Move 2: Zoom out: Used to give the viewer a wider picture of what is there.
Shot Move 3: Panning left and right: Another way to give the viewer of what is there.
(Shot moves 2 and 3 are also a way to distract you from what's happening in the place you just watched.)
Shot Move 4: Frame Action: Used if a good amount of action is happening that fulfills the need to move the camera.
Shot Move 5: Follow the Action: Used if the thing to focus on does not stay in the same place.
Shot Placement 1: Small: Zoomed into a specific part of an actor.
Shot Placement 2: Medium: About 2/3 of the actor, a little scenery.
Shot Placement 3: Full: The actor's full body and scenery.
Shot Placement 4: Over the shoulder: The shoulder of a person with their back to you and medium of another character facing them. Used if you don't want to see the shoulder's face.

,, This is their cue to talk, move and finish up.

, This will require at least two or more takes. Even then, you should probably do it one or two more times. With digital video, it's not like you're using up resources, although do be aware that you're using up people's time and your actors might get fed up after too many takes.

Consider purchasing a tablet.",How to Make an Animated Short Film1," This is often easier said than done, but you need to write down your ideas clearly and give them structure before you start working. Unlike in live action, it is almost impossible to ""improvise"" an animated film, as it simply takes too long animate everything. You can use a simple Word document or script writing software like Celtx, Writer Duets, or Final Draft. Your script doesn't need dialog, but it does need:


A theme. What is the ""point"" of the short film? This doesn't need to be grand, profound, or complicated. It can be anything from ""the loss of childhood innocence,"" or ""boredom is a state of mind,"" to ""I want to make people laugh with this joke."" Think of it as a guiding principle for your film.Characters. What will hold the attention of your audience? This can be anything from a person or an animal to a squiggly line, like the Oscar-winning short ""The Dot and the Line: A Romance.""

Visuals. Where does the short take place? What's the mood, or atmosphere? A screenplay needs to tell the story of the short in full so it can be used as a blueprint for future work.A beginning, middle, and end. This sounds obvious, but that's the point -- almost all stories are told in three specific, delineated parts, or acts. This doesn't mean you must have a three-act story, or even ""characters."" You do, however, need to think out the ""action"" of the short film before moving forward.Act 1 introduces the characters and a problem (they're hungry, the world is ending, boy has a crush on girl, etc.)
Act 2 complicates the story/problem (All the stores are closed, the bad guy might win, the girl has a boyfriend already, etc.).
Act 3 provides resolution to the problem (they find a sandwich shop, they save the world, the boy meets another girl, etc.)

;
, Before starting to animate, you need to know what your characters are going to look like. Sketch them in a variety of poses, costumes, and expressions to get a feel for what they will look like. Remember that a character can be anything in an animated film, from a bear to a pair of salt & pepper shakers. Still, you want to develop your characters ahead of time so that they look consistent when you animate them., Storyboards are individual drawings for every bit of action in the script and are used in the production of almost every film -- animated or otherwise. They are both simple and comprehensive, as you need one for every change you want in the film. They do not, however, need background detail or color, unless it is essential to the story. You can find and print a variety of free storyboard templates online, or draw your own. Each frame of the storyboard has two parts:


The Image: In a rectangular box, draw the principal action of the shot, ignoring background images for now. You can also draw notes or arrows to indicate movement.

The Dialogue. Underneath the shot, write down what needs to be said in the shot, the proposed length of the shot, and any effects (zoom in, shaky camera, etc.), Once you have your shots planned out, import them into your computer. Make sure to name them appropriately (Act1.Scene1.Shot1.jpg, for example). When you're done, import them all into your film editing software (iMovie, Windows Movie Maker, Final Cut Pro, Adobe AfterEffects, etc.) and put them in the correct order.Adobe AfterEffects or Premier are considered the industry standards, but you can use whatever program you are most comfortable with.

, Animatics are the rough cuts of animation -- they get the pace and rhythm of the short together and allow you to to get the timing right for your final short. This sounds complicated, however, they are really just slideshows with proper timing. Put the images of the storyboard in order on your editing software and extend, cut, and play with them until you have a ""rough"" cut of the final film.You can find examples of animatics online, like the animatic for the music video ""Feel Good Inc."" as well as some Pixar animatics.
Almost all animated movies are made into animatics first. Otherwise you risk spending hours fully animating a scene that needs to change, get longer or shorter, or get deleted.

, Once you have your rough timing down, it's time to pre-record the dialog. This doesn't have to be perfect, and you can even fake the sound effects with your mouth and hands if you want. What matters is the timing. Do you have enough time in the ""shot"" to get all the words out? Extend or shorten the length of your slides as necessary.

The closer you can get the dialog to perfect, the better, as most good voice acting requires proper timing. That said, now is not the time to worry about the finer details of voice acting. You need to get your animatic together before moving on to full production.

, The final animatic should tell the full story of your film, minus the trappings of color, backgrounds, and details.


If you are knowledgeable of video editing, you can add pans, zooms, and transitions right now to test them before your final editing.

, Tablets are small computer pads that come with an electronic pen, allowing you to ""draw"" straight into your computer. Drawing well with a mouse is nearly impossible, and unless you plan on small projects or stop-motion work, you will almost definitely need a tablet."

Determine your animating medium.,
Draw out your backgrounds.,
Sketch, model, or design your ""key poses."",
Draw out the ""in-between"" frames.,
Composite the footage.",How to Make an Animated Short Film2," This usually depends on your expertise and hardware. For example, it is very difficult, if not impossible, for a beginner with an older computer to make 3D animations like Pixar. There are many, many animating software and styles, and all of them have intricacies and techniques unique to the software.


2D Animation: This is the classic cartoon, hand-drawn look. The characters are flat line drawings. Originally, they were drawn frame by frame, but now there is a variety of software that makes the process much faster, such as Synfig, Pencil2D, ToonBoom, or even Adobe Photoshop. Traditionally, you use 12-24 drawings per second of film.3D Animation: Similar to the models used in video games and movies like Toy Story and Shrek, 3D animation is much harder to master. You make models of the characters and code movement into them, making 3D animation a sort of artistic/coding hybrid. You also need to add lighting and textures. 3D software can used, yet it takes a long time and requires software like AutoDesk, Poser Pro, Aladdin, or Sketchup. Most 3D animation is the result of large teams working together.Stop-Motion: So simple anyone can do it, stop-motion is when you use real-life figures or drawings and take a picture after every small movement. When the pictures are played back to back at high speeds, it looks like movement. It is incredibly time-consuming, however, as you often need upwards of 12 photos per-second of footage to make it look smooth. You can use cut-outs, clay models, individual drawings, or real people to make it.Rotoscoping: A niche form of animation found in films like A Scanner Darkly, rotoscoping is animating on top of conventionally shot films. You will need a tablet, and you go through the footage frame by frame, using the live video as a guide for drawing the characters. The result is a realistic, but still animated, look.

, Start with your settings, as the characters are superimposed on them. The background should be everything that the characters do not interact with, as anything that moves needs to be animated. The background should be a big drawing and scanned in at high resolution. This allows you to ""zoom in"" on certain sections without distortion. For example, if you have two characters talking in a cafe, you want to draw the whole cafe behind them. But you may want the ""camera"" to focus in on each character as they talk individually. Instead of redrawing the background behind him, you can copy and paste a smaller section of your detailed background for ""close ups."", What are the essential poses of your characters, or defining actions each one makes, in the scene? Think of these as the ""destinations"" for each piece of movement. Take, for example, a character winding up for a punch. You could break this down into three ""key poses,"" each of which needs to be drawn and saved separately.Key Pose 1 = Resting. It could be a face of surprise, anger, or determination, or simply the character with its hands at its sides.
Key Pose 2 = Winding Up. How does the character cock their arm back? Don't worry yet about the movement to get to this position, just draw out them with their arm back and ready to release.
Key Pose 3 = The Follow Through. Where does the character end up right after the punch? Their arm will be exposed and their body likely follows through. Again, you want the final pose, not the frames as the hand goes through.
The more key poses you draw, the more complex the movement will be. For example, you can add keyframe sof the character looking shocked, balling into a fist, dropping their elbow, swinging their arm, punching, then spinning around on the follow through.

, Take the punch for example -- how do you get from key to key? There is some advanced software that will do this for you -- once you've made character models, the software will ""render"" the movement in between for you. However, if you are just starting out, you'll likely need to draw your own frames by hand. The more frames you draw, the smoother the action will look.

It can help to put your keyframes on the screen as guides. This helps you see where you need to get the characters, and where they started.
If something doesn't move, don't bother re-drawing. Copy and paste the keyframe, erase the part that needs to move, and keep everything else where it was.

, Composting is just a fancy way to describe stringing the movie together. This can be as simple as ordering all the frames for stop-motion or as complicated as rendering a 3D model with accurate lighting. Again, your method of animation will determine how you composite something:For 2D animators, compositing is about making the motion looks smooth. Software like ToonBoom will do this for you, and may be called ""rendering.""
For 3D animators, know that this takes a long time. Lighting effects and textures are difficult to program, and even the fastest computers may take hours to composite a video.
For stop-motion animators, you should play with frame length, adjusting the shots by a tenth or hundredth of a second to get smooth, fluid motion."
"
Record any dialog for the final movie.,
Add in sound-effects where appropriate.,
Cut the film into your final vision.,
Add your polishing touches, like effects, transitions, and color correction.",How to Make an Animated Short Film3," Now that you have the nearly-finished animation, it's time to get the vocals just right. Your voice actors can see the final scene, their characters' expressions, and the timing you want in your final shot. This allows them (or you) to deliver the best vocal performance.

Note that, at this point, any changes to the animation might be very time-consuming to make. This is why careful pre-production is essential to an animated film of any length.

, Sound effects should come after the voice actors, and tuned to the appropriate volume where they don't overpower the dialog. There are some exceptions to this rule, of course. For example, if there is an explosion the characters need to react to, it may be best to put it in first, before recording dialog. This helps the actors out with reactions.Sound mixing is an important, and subtle, art form. Invest in a good pair of headphones and/or speakers to fine tune all the volumes correctly.

, Now that you've got the whole movie together, how does it hold up? The chances are that some of the transitions feel clunky and a scene or two goes longer than it should. Just like you would edit any live-action film, you need to turn a critical eye to your animated piece and polish it until it sparkles. While there is no ""correct"" way to edit a film, there are a couple of principles to keep in mind:

Do any scenes feel quick and essential? Do you feel engaged the whole time? Does a specific line or shot help move the story or theme along? If the answer to any of these questions is no, start trimming. Oftentimes the first and last lines of dialog are inessential, as jumping straight into/out of a scene is usually more engaging. Every frame counts when editing.
Watch the film with someone who is distant from the project. Were there parts the got bored? Did anything confuse them or need more time? How can you cut and trim your story to make it as gripping as possible?
How do the scene flow together? Sometimes 2-3 seconds of background footage helps the viewer catch their breath and dive into the next scene before dialog starts., For example, if you want an old-time, sepia tint to your movie, add it last. These sorts of small changes are unnecessary while you are trimming, cutting, and building your movie. Moreover, they will be useless if you cut the scene or change the color scheme. All these minute touches need to come last, once you're sure the ""meat"" of the movie is done.

Add wipes, dissolves, or fade-ins to the scene transitions.
Add any filters or effects over the finished footage.
Add titles and credits to the beginning and end as necessary, at the very end.

Characters: You could use the characters from the canon, or write your own characters. Make sure any characters you write aren't overly perfect, or ""Mary Sue"" characters.
Setting: This can be just about anywhere in Equestria. For example, Ponyville, the Everfree Forest, or anywhere else. You can even make up your own towns if you want.

There is lots of people out there with the same passion for model horses. Once you begin, there's no end!;
, Once you have a YouTube channel or account, you should find some true subscribers who will watch, like and comment on your videos. If that happens, more people will subscribe to you through some of your subscribers!

, There are lots of amazing model horse series already out there. You should start by trying to find some that you enjoy, this will give you ideas and inspiration for your series!

, Now that you have ideas running through your head, you should choose some models you want in your series. Do not choose models of different brands or sizes for this would look silly. Try your best neither to choose your most fancy or most prized models nor your most awful, scratched up models. It's helpful to choose models with a gaited stance, not ones that are lying down or grazing.

, You may have some ideas or inspiration which is great. Now it's time to make some of these ideas into a real thing. You can do this by writing down the ideas you have or typing them up. In the end you should choose one of these ideas to be the main idea of the series.

, You can do this to by writing or typing it up. Make sure to include details and surprises that your audience wouldn't expect. Also consider, to relate things to horses instead of humans/people.

,


To create a setting simply think of what time period you would like this to take place in. Think of where you will be filming the series, instead of dreaming of some amazing place you want but won't be able to create or reproduce.
Characters should all be unique. You should give them different looks, names and personalities. For example are they they kind and caring or rude and cruel?
The title you choose for the series should be based upon the series.

, You may want a script that is typed out for it would be easier to read. The script is not a full out exact way to do the series, its just a guideline of what should be happening in scenes and what characters will be doing. To write the script, simply think about what you want happening in the episode/part. Never give away too much at once, for you want your viewers interested in what will happen next to give them reason to keep watching the series. Maintain an element of suspense. Do not allow it to become predictable; add a twist. Make the script easy to read, label who is speaking and possible add what kind of tone they have etc.

, This is an optional choice. You can hold a casting call for your characters if you do not want to use your own voice and would rather have a variety of voices in your series. This gives your series a more professional appeal. When choosing parts make sure they fit your character and the voice you wanted for them. Ensure the people doing the voices have a good recorder and have a good sense of timing so that they can say their lines on time but equally appreciate the benefits of a pregnant pause. Ensure that they will have their work done on time; you don't want someone holding up your whole series because of their laziness, lack of commitment or lack of time management.

, It's finally time to film your series. Remember to use the best possible video camera. Find different angles you like for the characters. You can have shots of them walking, running, fighting, talking etc. Try to have the least amount background noise as possible if you are not adding voices later or doing the characters voices. Avoid background items you don't want or don't need, such as cars or houses. Follow the script to know the time management of shots of the clips but do not be afraid to improvise if you feel inspired!

, It's important that you edit your video clips to the best of your ability. Find the best video editor you can get; it does not have to be a fancy or expensive one. Special effects and background music are a nice touch.

, Its for sure to become a successful series!!

If it's an action figure this it pretty much unavoidable but it won't matter because the limbs of an action figure will stay in place, unlike that of a stuffed animals.;
, For example, build a bedroom, kitchen, living room (den), bathroom and use stuff that's on scale (like a doll stuff). You can substitute things like refrigerators by using something like a box and covering it with paper, or to make a t.v. you can use an old mirror and draw buttons and stuff on it to look like a plasma screen
, It should be simple at first. After you get better, you can do more complex movements like going through your character's daily routine. This can be fun and entertaining to watch.

, A camera with a tripod is recommended when making a stop motion video. The camera and framing should not be moved unless you want to change the scene. This will clearly show the movements of the characters. If you want to show a slow movement, slightly move the characters. If you want them to move at regular speed, move them about a centimeter each frame. For fast movement, move the character an inch or so.

, Import all the pictures that you took. There should be at least 170-200 images.

, Use Windows Movie Maker or other video editing software to process and edit the images. Open or drag all the images that you will use in the timeline.

, Click on the first image then go to Edit and change the Duration field. Make it to 0.125 which means 25 frames per second. Do this to all the images. Also, make sure that the images are sequenced correctly.

Make sure it’s a game with a large following as the fans of the game are likely to be your initial audience. You should choose a game that you are fairly familiar with.Some popular games to use for machinima include:


Halo
World of Warcraft
The Sims
Grand Theft Auto;
, If you choose a computer game like “World of Warcraft”, the only hardware that you’ll need is your computer and a microphone. If the game you choose is for your console. You’ll need your computer, a microphone, your console and a video capture card.


Make sure your video capture card has a USB drive so it can connect to your computer.
If your console has its own capture software, you won’t need a capture card.

, Besides a copy of the game you’ll be using, you’ll also need video capturing software and video editing software. Download the programs you’ll need to create your machinima.


Fraps is a great video capture program you can use for computers. You can download it for free off the company’s website.
Sony Vegas is a great program to use for editing your film.

, Watch some other machinimas to get ideas for your own. What do you like about them? What don’t you like about them? Pay close attention to the way their characters move and interact.Study machinimas like:


Red vs. Blue
Make Love, Not Warcraft
A Law-Abiding Engineer

, What do you want your machinima to be about? Decide a tone for it. Take some time to figure out how you want your machinima to be perceived. The game you choose can help you make a decision. For instance, if your game has a science fiction theme, you’ll have plenty of science fiction animation to work with.


Your machinima can be a comedy.
Your machinima can be dramatic.
Your machinima can be an action thriller.

, Choose where your story takes place. You’ll be somewhat limited in your selection using footage from a video game. Be thorough in creating the backstory for your setting. Your story may take place in:


A post-apocalyptic wasteland
A friendly neighborhood
An office environment
A war zone

, Once again, you’ll be somewhat limited in creating characters using video game footage. Create a protagonist, an antagonist and the various other characters you’ll need to drive your story. Give them personalities and experiences that influence the way they interact with each other.


If you’re using a game like ""World of Warcraft"", you can build characters in the game to suit your specifications.
If you’re using a game like ""Halo"", you may have a set amount of character models to choose from.

, There has to be a reason for your story. Give your characters a reason to act. If you’re creating an episodic, make sure that as soon as one conflict resolves, there is another one waiting to take its place.Even a comedy has to have some sort of stakes or it will become boring.

, You can make it witty but try to keep it simple. You’ll need to make your characters look like they are saying your words. You may have trouble matching big words with the characters’ vocal animations.


Include inside jokes about the game you’re using to appeal to your audience.

, Your machinima will likely end up on the internet where it will be viewed by people with very short attention spans., You’ll want to sketch out the scenes you need to film. Make sure to account for all the characters that will be in your scene and everything you need them to interact with.This will save time when you are capturing footage.


If your character has to fall on a table, include it in your storyboard so you know to add it in your set.

, Choose a group of actors to voice your characters. You can hold auditions or you can just use your friends.


One actor can play multiple characters if they can believably change their voice.

, If you’re using Fraps, open your screen capture software on your computer. You’ll have to choose a ""hot key"" that will record footage when you press it. Choose a key that doesn’t interfere with the controls of the game.Open your game while you have Fraps open. When you want to record, press your ""hot key"" to start recording and again to stop. Do this until you’ve required all the necessary footage.


Fraps has a green screen function, so you may want to record your character actions separate from your setting.
Make sure your frame rate is at least thirty frames per second so your video doesn’t lag.
Choose a file where you can save your footage that you can identify later on. Title each bit of footage so you can remember which is which.
Remember, the free version of Fraps will only record in thirty-second increments
If you’re recording with a capture card, input your footage into your computer using Windows Movie Maker or another program.

, In Fraps, go to ""sound capture settings"" under the ""movies"" tab. Choose to record from an external microphone. Choose a save file you’ll to store your audio. Then pick a ""hot key"" to record your sound.Try to match your footage as best you can with your voice recording so that everything fits together smoothly. It may take some time to make everything sound natural.


Unclick your operating system in Fraps when you’re recording voices.
Unclick your microphone in Fraps when you’re recording game sounds.
Make sure your microphone is enabled on your computer and is the default recording device. Right click your sound icon and go to ""recording devices"" and enable the microphone.
Adjust the recording volume of your microphone and the in-game sounds by clicking on the sound icon and selecting ""mixer"".

, Import your footage from Fraps into your editing software. Sync the audio to the footage and add whatever sound effects you need. Arrange your footage carefully so that it tells your story. Add cut scenes, background music and anything else you need to help the flow.


Because Fraps doesn’t compress files, you may need to convert your Fraps AVI files to a more manageable format like MPEG-2. Brorsoft video converter is a good app to download for this.Be sure to add a short intro with the name of your production company to get your name out there.

Anime is popular in Japan and worldwide, creating animation like Pokémon, Princess Mononoke, Sailor Moon, and Fullmetal Alchemist. Anime can be serious and adult, or cartoonish and childlike. There's something for everyone.


Many great Anime series started out as Manga, which is basically the Japanese version of comic books. Sometimes manga are better, typically faster to get through, and cost about $12. DVDs for a series might cost $20 for 5 episodes. Consider checking out a few manga for a cheap alternative.;
, Anime isn't a distinct genre, it's more of an art style. Within Anime, there are fantasy stories, love stories, space-gangster operas, and any number of different types of stories that you can get involved with. So, one of the most important questions you have to ask yourself is, ""What do I like?"" Common Anime subgenres include:


kodomo (for children), usually light-hearted comedy
shōjo (for girls'), usually slices of life
shounen (for boys'), usually about heroes
magical
harem
sports
martial arts
literary
medieval

, Anime is not always a long and seemingly endless series. There are a popular 12-episode, 24+ episode, 30+ episode Anime you can start with and usually have follow-up seasons. Short popular Anime are:

Attack on Titan
Re: Zero
Death Note
Angel Beats!
Suzuka
School Prison
Tenchi Muyo: War on Geminar
School Days
Code Geass
Another
Mirai Nikki/Future Diary etc.

, Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli are sort of like the Disney Studios or the Steven Spielberg of anime. They're very well-known. Anything from either one of these names is bound to be pretty spectacular. More often than not, Studio Ghibli comes up with deep, profound works for older audiences, but still make stories children love. It's a good place to start, if you're looking to dip a toe in. Some of the classics of the Anime canon include:


Princess Mononoke
Graves of the Fireflies
The Girl Who Leapt Through Time
My Neighbour Totoro
Whisper of the Heart
Paprika

, When most people think of Anime, they think of long-form shows. These feature dynamic characters and lots of drama. If you want to explore one, here's a list of popular and classic anime series that lots of different kinds of people enjoy:


Witch Hunter Robin
Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood
Cowboy Bebop
DragonBall Z
Code Geass
Psycho Pass
Naruto
Ceres, Celestial Legend
Vision of Escaflowne
Eden of the East
Soul Eater (ending varies from manga)

, Anime comes in two varieties, subbed and dubbed. Most people find that the original Japanese voice actors are better to listen to than the dubbed Anime voices, which can sound cartoonish and silly. If you don't mind doing a little reading, try to go for the subtitled option.


There's good and bad on both sides. It comes down to personal preference, not what others say after all. If you don't mind that the mouths and the sounds don't match up, go for the dubbed anime.

, Anime is long-form story telling. That means you need to have some patience and wait a while before you make up your mind about a show. If you're trying out a new series, watch a couple of episodes at least before you pass judgment.


The first episode for some series can be deceiving. The first episode of Elfin Lied has a naked woman and tons of gore but as it progresses there's far more to the story than just that. Don't worry: the characters eventually find their clothes.
On the other hand, a series can deceive you by drawing you in, only to end up being dull. Sometimes, really popular series start to suffer later in the series.

, Anime is just as diverse as any variety of art or animation. Some of it looks hyper-realistic, while other styles are cartoonish and over-the-top, featuring talking Pandas and people with giant eyeballs. That's part of the fun.


Most anime features very angular people, and a hand-drawn approach, with a very light touch. Others feature eye-popping color. While a particular anime might be your genre, the art style might turn you off. 80's Anime looks different from newer Anime thanks to unique and changing styles.

, Some anime series seem to drag on for quite some time, before suddenly getting violent or fast-paced. Anime is like that. A single fight in DragonBall Z can take about half a season, and feature a whole lot of build up before anything actually happens. It's a different sort of drama, and one that can seem strange to a Western audience. But that's part of the fun, and it's part of what people like about it. Don't expect to watch a version of what you're used to, but with different art.

, Just because your best friend swears by Fullmetal Alchemist doesn't mean it's the best. Not everyone likes fighting, so don't watch Naruto if you're not a fan. Same goes for anything.


Price doesn't equal quality. Great anime and manga can sometimes be found in bargain bins because they're not well known. If Anime is pricey, that could mean it's new or popular.

, As with any topic, talking to other enthusiasts is a great way to learn more about how to appreciate the wide world of Anime. It can seem overwhelming to the beginner, but once you've got a knowledgeable guide, it can be a whole lot easier.


Share what you learn, as well. Lend out DVD's to friends, invite people over for Anime night. The point should be to have fun, so share what you've grown to love.

, It's important to support studies, but sites like anime.net can be a good way to preview a show before you spend money. This is especially true when one doesn't have an Anime channel in their area, or a channel that plays more than just Pokémon.


Netflix and Google Play and other streaming services regularly have a wide variety of anime that you can watch for a monthly fee. It's a good option if you're curious, but don't want to invest in buying a series outright.
If after the first 3 episodes, a show seems like something you'd enjoy, go and buy the series, or explore other options for watching it via a streaming service.

, If you like an art style, check out an anime similar, by finding something that looks like it appeals to you. Or look at what else that particular director or artist has been involved with.


You'll find, for example, that The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is similar to Angel Beats. If you know you like Witch Hunter Robin, then try Ghost in the Shell since they're the same genre.

Write a plot summary.,
Write a screenplay for your film.,
Break down each scene into a series of shots.,
Make a shot list.,
Create storyboard panels based on your shot list.",How to Make a Cartoon Movie1," To help you get a better sense of your story idea, you should write out a rough plot summary or a synopsis of your film. Your plot summary should identify the film’s protagonist, the film’s antagonist, and the goal of the film, or the call to action for your characters.


For example, the synopsis of Toy Story is: This 3D animated feature tells the story of a pull-string cowboy doll named Woody, who is the leader of the toys until the latest action figure, astronaut Buzz Lightyear, is added to the toy box. When Woody and Buzz are separated from their owner, they are forced to set aside their differences and work together to defeat a mean kid and return to the boy they both love.This synopsis is strong because it identifies the protagonists of the film (the cowboy and the astronaut), it identifies their antagonist or conflict (separation from their owner), and it discusses their goal (getting back to their owner by working together).;
, Once you have a strong plot summary, you will need to sit down and write out a rough draft of a screenplay for your film. The length of your screenplay will depend on how long you are planning to make your film. Most feature films are 100-120 pages long and are broken into three main acts. If you are planning to write a short film, it may be 40-50 pages long, depending on the desired length of the film.


As you write your screenplay, you should keep in mind the goals of your characters and the overall meaning of the film. Many script writers will create an initial flash draft, or first attempt, to get their ideas down and sketch out scenes. They will then go back and revise the script, cutting any drawn out scenes and adding in any necessary scenes to flesh out the story.

, It can be overwhelming to try to take a long script and turn it into a film. Make the storyboard process easier by focusing on one scene at a time, breaking down each scene into a series of shots. A shot is when the camera turns on to cover an event or action until it is turned off, so it is considered continuous footage with no cuts. You should evaluate each shot so you know what is required for each shot before you start to make the film.Consider the location setting for the shot. Is the scene all going to shot in one location or are their multiple locations for the scene? What will be in the shot in terms of setting?
You should also think about how many actors are required for the shot and if you need any props in the shot. Because you will be creating an animated film, you should list any props or effects you will need to build during the animation process.
Think about the type of shot you are going to use, such as a close-up, an establishing shot, or a wide-shot. You should also think about the angle of the shot, or where the camera is shooting from in the setting. Maybe you will use a high angle shot for a dramatic establishing shot or a low angle shot for a close shot of a character. Consider how the camera is going to move in the shot, will it follow the actor or the props in the shot?

, A shot list will help you get a better sense of what is required for each shot and make it easier for you to translate them into separate storyboard panels. Your shot list should cover the major shots for each scene and identify all characters, locations, and props for each shot.


Your shot list will likely change or shift as you start to build the film so do not get too attached to it. But you should still create a detailed shot list as a guide as you start to build your film.

, Storyboard panels look like boxes on a blank sheet of paper that you can then fill with a drawing of each shot on your shot list. You can buy pads of storyboard panels at your local art store or draw out your own panels. You should have four to six boxes per 8 ½ x 11 piece of white paper, with enough space between each panel so they are easy to read and follow.When drawing storyboards for an animated film, it is important that you try to think in a 3-D perspective. This will give your storyboard drawings more depth and as a result, give the shots in your film more depth. You can create a grid floor on the storyboard panels to help give the drawings more depth and perspective.
Try to add in as much detail as possible in your storyboards, especially for major shots or scenes. Use all areas of the panel, including the foreground, background, and mid-ground.
If you have more than one character in a shot, try to group them together and label them so they are easy to identify. You should also make sure all your characters are easy to recognize on the storyboard panels, whether it is with a label, a physical marker, or an arrow with their name. This will help you remember which character is in each shot when you sit down to build your film.

Use a computer animation program.,
Design your characters and props.,
Place the characters and props in the settings provided by the computer program.,
Animate the movie based on your storyboards.",How to Make a Cartoon Movie2," There are many computer animation programs you can use online, with prices varying from very inexpensive to more expensive. Many programs do not require extensive knowledge about computer animation and are designed to help beginners learn how to make their own cartoon movies. You can also design your characters and add props to shots with a few clicks of a mouse, making it easy and fast to build your movie.


A list of the top seven computer animation programs can be found here: http://www.freemake.com/blog/5-best-sites-to-make-animated-video-trouble-free/. They are rated based on their accessibility, their price, and their range of options.

, You can use the computer animation program to design each character in your cartoon and any props you may need for your movie. Many programs will provide models that you can edit and add to, adjusting them to fit the look of your characters.


Most programs come with a library of props that you can access for your movie. You may also be able to build your own props if it is not a very common or well known prop, i.e. a magic wand or a special sword.

, Most computer animation programs come with several standard settings that you can use for your movie. Once you have designed your characters and props, you can start to place them in the settings to see how they look.


If you are making a movie about a boy wizard in medieval times, for example, you may choose a castle setting or a rural farm setting. You may then place your boy wizard in the setting with props like a magic wand, a sorcerer's hat, and maybe even a fire breathing dragon.

, Use your carefully drawn storyboards as a guide for animating the movie. Focus on creating the movie one scene at a time, moving your characters and props in different settings within the computer animation program.


Once you finish animating the rough cut of the movie, you should watch it from beginning to end, noting any scenes that appear underdeveloped or confusing and checking that the pace of the movie is appropriate to the content. If you are making an action packed movie about a boy wizard and his quest to save the world, for example, the pace should be brisk and quick. If you are making a mode meditative film on the death of the family pet, the pace of the movie may be a bit slower and drawn out.

Gather your supplies.,
Set up a home movie studio.,
Draw and capture each scene of the movie.,
Edit the cartoon movie to make a final cut.",How to Make a Cartoon Movie3," To do stop motion animation at home, you will need several basic home supplies such as:A laptop or computer that can process video data.
A webcam that is detached from your laptop or computer.
A flat, stable surface like a desk.
Masking tape.
Basic animation software.

, To create the stop motion animation, you will need to capture each frame of the animation so they create a complete animation when you edit them together. To do this, you will draw one frame of the animation, capture it, and then change the animation a little bit, and then capture the next frame. You will do this until you have animated the entire movie. You can use your storyboards as a guide for each animation you will be drawing.Start by attaching a sheet of paper to the table with masking tape all the way around the paper. This will ensure that you place all the sheets of paper in exactly the same position so the animation appears smooth and fluid.
Place the webcam on another surface so it is looking down on the paper. Tape the webcam to a surface so it is at the perfect angle. Try taping the webcam to the side of the desk lamp and then positioning the desk lamp so it shines right on the paper. This will ensure your light source and the webcam are always facing the paper.
Plug the webcam into your computer so the captured images are uploaded to the animation program on your computer.

, Once you have set up your home movie studio, you can begin to draw and capture your movie. Draw your first picture and capture four identical frames so you have enough video during the editing process. As well, adding extra time at the beginning of the animation will make it look smoother when you play it back and edit it.Add to the existing drawing and capture two more frames. Continue to add to the drawing and capture two frames of every change.
If you need to start a new scene or make a big change to the drawing, you can start the drawing on a new sheet of paper. Place the new sheet on top of the first piece of paper and trace around any elements in the first sheet of paper that you are going to use in your next frame. Then, remove the first piece of paper and replace it with the new piece of paper.
Continue to add to the drawing or add a new drawing, capturing each change in two frames, until you have completed the movie.

, Once you have put together a rough version of your cartoon film, you should watch it from start to finish. Take notes as you watch it, marking down any scenes that feel too long or unnecessary to the story. You should also make sure there is continuity in every scene of the film, where all the props used are consistent from shot to shot.


You may need to reshoot certain shots or scenes by re drawing them or taking an existing drawing and changing it. You should always shoot two frames of your edited drawings so you have enough footage to add into the final draft of the movie.

When brainstorming a new idea for a cartoon, keep in mind how much you can afford to invest in the process and what your artistic skill is capable of producing.


If you are a beginner, you might want to stay away from stories and themes that require animating complex scenes, like huge battles or intricate machinery. Your animating skills may need to be refined and practiced more before you are ready to tackle a project of that size.
Also keep in mind that you will need more equipment depending on how complex you want your cartoon to be. A claymation cartoon with two dozen characters and four sets will require more supplies than a cel animation with only one scene. If budget is an issue, keep it short and simple.;
, The right length for your cartoon will vary based on the market you are trying to distribute it in. Knowing the length from the start will help you brainstorm a story that can fit within that time frame.


If you want to create a cartoon that could develop into a long-term show, your cartoon will need to be either 11 minutes or 20 to 25 minutes.
Cartoon movies can go anywhere from 60 minutes to 120 minutes.
If a one-time cartoon made for the Internet is all you want to create, you can create a short running from 1 to 5 minutes. Creating anything longer may turn people away from viewing it.

, Even though cartoons are traditionally aimed at kids, there are many cartoons made for older adolescents and adults. The age group and other audience demographics should shape the ideas you come up with.


For example, a cartoon about something tragic, like the death of a loved one, would be better reserved for a slightly older audience. If a young audience is your target, you would be better off choosing a topic that is a little simpler to understand and more concrete.

, Another way to put this would be, “write what you know.” Many storytellers write stories based on events, feelings, or relationships they experienced in their own lives. Make a list of possible life events you have been through that could be the underlying idea behind a cartoon.


If you want to create a cartoon with a serious tone, think about life experiences that really mold and shape you: an unrequited love, the loss of a friend, working hard toward a goal that seemed impossible, etc.
If you want to create something more humorous, take an everyday situation like waiting in traffic or waiting on an email and exaggerate how difficult the situation is in a funny way.
Alternatively, you can use something already funny to create a humorous cartoon.

, Of course, there are many plots that do not involve any trace of life experience. You can use your interests and your imagination to craft an entirely new premise, as long as you include enough relatable details to help people connect to the characters or the story.


Relatable details include underlying themes that are universally appealing. For example, most people can relate to a coming-of-age story, regardless of whether that story takes place in the contemporary real world, in a futuristic space-age setting, or in a sword-and-sorcery fantasy setting.

, Make a list of character traits you would like to see in a protagonist. Write positive features as well as faults to avoid making a character too perfect.


This is an important step no matter how simple or complex your cartoon will be. While a character in a longer, more serious cartoon will need to develop more, a short, funny cartoon will need a protagonist with a clear goal and clear character traits that allow him or her to react to the conflict in whatever way he or she does.

, If any of the characters in your cartoon will have spoken lines, you will need a voice actor to recite those lines, and your voice actor will need a written script so that he or she knows what needs to be said.


You need to know the script before you can animate the cartoon. The mouth moves in different ways for different phonemes, and you will need to animate these different mouth movements in a believable way so that any voice overs you add later will match them.

, If there is no dialog in the cartoon, you might be able to skip a formal script. You should still write down a basic narrative of events so that you can keep track of the story and its different pieces, though.


Write multiple drafts of any script before beginning the production phase. Write your first draft, set it aside, and come back to it in a day or two to see how you can improve upon it and make it flow more effectively.

, A short cartoon may only consist of a single scene, but if your cartoon is a little longer, you might need to divide it into multiple scenes or acts for easier management.

, When you sketch out a formal storyboard, each major change in action should be shown in one of the storyboard squares. Minor changes should be described, but may not need to be drawn out.


Use basic shapes, stick figures, and simple backgrounds. A storyboard should be fairly basic.
Consider drawing your storyboard frames on index cards so that you can rearrange them and move parts of the story around as necessary.
You can also include notes about what is happening in each frame so that it will be easier to remember later on., In general, most forms of animation will fall under the categories of cel animation, stop motion animation, 2D computer animation, and 3D computer animation., Cel animation is the traditional method of making a cartoon. You will need to hand draw each cel or sheet of animation and take pictures of those cels with a special camera.


Cel animation utilizes a principle similar to the way a flipbook works. A series of drawings is produced, and each image varies slightly from the next. When displayed in rapid succession, the differences create the illusion of movement.
Each image is drawn and colored on a transparent sheet known as a ""cell.""
Use your camera to photograph these drawings and edit them together using animation editing software.

, Stop motion is another traditional form of animation, but it is used less commonly than cel animation. “Claymation” is the most common form of stop motion animation, but there are other puppets you can use and make for this sort of cartoon, as well.


You can use shadow puppets, sand art, paper puppets, or anything else that can be moved into a range of positions.
Each movement must be small. Take a photograph of each movement after making it.
Edit the photographs together so that they are displayed in rapid succession. When viewed in this manner, the eye will perceive movement.

, You will need a special computer program for this type of animation, and the product will likely look like a smoother version of a cartoon animated with cel animation.


Each 2D computer animation program will work differently, so you will need to find tutorials for the specific program you intend to use in order to learn how to do it.
A common example of 2D animation is any cartoon created using Adobe Flash.

, As with 2D animation, you will need special software to produce 3D animated cartoons, as well.


In some sense, 3D computer animation is similar in style to stop-motion animation, but the graphics can range from seeming very blocky and pixelated to being very life-like.
As with 2D computer animation, each animation software works a little differently than the others. Examples include Maya and 3D Studio Max.

, You will need a good microphone and a way to prevent echo or background noise from bleeding into the sound you want to keep.


A high-quality computer microphone will work effectively enough for a beginning cartoon, but if you plan to seriously market and distribute your cartoon, you will eventually need to invest in more professional equipment.
When working with a small microphone, encase it in a tube speaker box lined with foam to cut out echo and excess background noise.

, Get creative and look for simple, everyday ways to make noises passably similar to the noises you need for your cartoon.


Make a list of sound effects you will need. Be creative and thorough, including everything from the obvious (explosions, alarm clocks) to the less obvious (footsteps, background noise).Record different versions of each sound so that you have more options to use.
A few examples of sounds you can create include:Fire - Manipulate a piece of stiff cellophane
Slap - Clap your hands together once
Thunder - Shake a piece of plexi-glass or thick cardstock
Boiling water - Blow air into a glass of water using a straw
Baseball bat hitting a ball - Snap a wooden matchstick



, If you do not have access to the equipment or otherwise find it impossible to make your own, there are CD-ROMS and websites offering royalty-free pre-record sounds you can use as desired, and this might be a more viable option for you.


Always review the usage permissions for any pre-recorded sound effects you use. Even if something is free to download, it may not be free to use, especially for commercial purposes. It is very important that you know what you are permitted to do before you use a sound for your cartoon.

, If your cartoon has dialog in it, you or others you know will need to be the voice bringing your characters to life. As you record your lines, read from the script using appropriate intonation and expression, and make sure that you match your lips to the animated lips of the cartoon.


Consider manipulating the voices using computer software. If you have fewer voice actors than characters, you can change the voice of one character simply by adjusting the attributes of the voice sample you already gathered. You will need to invest in special audio editing software to do this, but depending on which one you use, you can likely change the pitch and add overtones, like metallic garbles, to the voice recording., If you have a short, one-time cartoon, or if you are trying to gain a name for yourself on your own, you can add your new cartoon to your digital portfolio and upload a copy to a personal blog, social media account, or video website.

, If you created a pilot episode for a cartoon at home, you can spread word for it through either route. If accepted, you will need to figure out your new production schedule for future cartoons so that you can get to work all over again.


A distribution company will review your pilot episode and determine how marketable it might be. If they decide to represent your cartoon, you will be given a distribution plan and revenue projection. Ask for a formal letter of interest at this point and show the letter to potential investors to let them know that a distributor will be willing to represent your cartoon.
If you go directly to an animation company or TV station with your pilot episode, they might be willing to accept and distribute it directly, especially if they have empty time slots to fill.

, There are many free and paid software s available for creating animations. Adobe Flash is the most commonly used commercial software to create 2D animations. There is a lot of free software that is designed for this purpose like Synfig. Autodesk Maya is a commercial software that is used for creating 3D animations. The free software s for this purpose includes Blender, POV-Ray 3.7.0 etc.. Try an internet search and find a software that suits to your needs.

, Whichever software you choose, there must be many tutorials available based on the software on the web -- at least on their website.

, After learning about the software you are familiar with all its tools and you might have practiced some tutorials also. Using that knowledge design a simple character(because you are just starting!). It can be a stick man, an animal, or just an imaginary character.

, You must have studied it when following step 3. Well, a timeline is like a storyboard in which it contains frames and all the characters movements are drawn onto the frames. A frame which has an object in it is called a key frame. An animation is created by playing a series of drawing one after another at really great speeds like 25 frames per second.

, Draw movements in each frame.

",How to Create a Good Animated Film," Brainstorm your characters and develop a plot for your story. Sometimes it's easier to focus on a good main character and revolve everything around them. Who would be this character's friends/enemies? Who would be their parents? What are their goals in life? What is their everyday attitude? Try to add a theme to this character's life. Will this be comedy or tragedy?;
, Draw a summary of what will take place in your movie. This can be simple sketches since it won't be in the final movie and might even be replaced or cut. Think of these as each page of a book. Don't draw every detail but express the point of each part.

, Be sure to include everything, especially dialogue. Every detail counts.

, Include lots and lots of details. You can even include traits about your character. Is your character the comedian of the movie or is your character something else?

, You should have decided what animation technique you will use by this point. Flip books are cheap and funny, but have several downsides (no sound, limited film length). Traditional animation has great quality, but takes a long time, is not very efficient, and is quite costly. You could always use animation software as well. It's all up to you, the creator!

, Decide if there is anything you would like to change about your film or something you don't like about your film. Cut it out if so.

Get a stack of paper.,
Choose your subject.,
Keep the sticky notes or notepad together.,
Locate the very bottom sheet of the pad.,
Turn to the next ""frame"" (the next sheet from the bottom).,
Repeat the process.,
Try it out!,
Be creative.",How to Make a Flipbook1," You can use notepads, post-it notes, notebook paper, printer paper, or even the corners of a book! Thin paper is generally better, as it's much easier to ""flip."" Thicker paper will do in a pinch, but your flip will probably be jerky or slow.


How much paper do you need? The more frames (pages) per second your flipbook has, the more realistic the movement by characters or objects will be.
Motion pictures generally have between 24 and 30 frames each and every second—which would be a lot of drawing, even for a 3-second flip! For a flipbook, somewhere between 5 and 15 frames per second will work fine.;
, Start with a design or character that you want to animate. You don't have to be a great artist, and your flipbook can be about anything you like. Your main characters could be stick figures, people, animals, or anything you'd like to see move such as a car, a plane, a boat, etc.


Inanimate objects can work well as flipbook also; something as simple as a bouncing ball can be a masterpiece.
Flipbooks don't have to be animated; you can use photos as well. Use your imagination!

, If you separate them, the flipbook might not work or might even fall apart.

, Draw the figure or object here first. Use a pencil so that you can erase mistakes. You can outline your pencil marks in pen if you wish to make it more visible later.









You can also start at the top sheet, but it will make it more difficult to achieve smooth animation since you won't be able to reference or trace the preceding image.
You can add a background too, if you wish. It could be a static scene, like a house or something that doesn't move from frame to frame, or it could be something that's moving too—like clouds, or an airplane.

, You should be able to see your original drawing through the sheet. If not, the paper may be too thick or your lines too light, so start again, as it's important that you can see through just enough to get a relative idea of where to draw the object.









If your subject is going to be moving, draw it in a slightly different location this time.
If not, draw it in the exact same place.
Bigger changes in the subject will appear as faster motion when you flip. Smaller changes will seem slower.

, Keep drawing the character or object over and over until you run out of slides. Each time make slight adjustments so that the character or object is starting to change position or move. How much you want the movement is up to you but you should plan each movement according to the amount of pages you have so that you can fit the move in.








, Test the end result to see if you have an animated character or object you like. If it doesn't seem to change much, go back and make a few changes to help increase the sense of animation.









Once you're satisfied with it, you can outline the pages in marker to make it easier to see.

, There are lots of things you can do with a flipbook. Start out small, maybe with a bouncing ball, or a frown filled face that turns into a smiley face. You can even expand on something you started, and make it something else.









For example, if you started with a bouncing ball, you could go over it again, and add arms and legs and a face that ""pops out"" every time the ball bounces.

, to make it ""sticky note"" sized, make the document 800 pixels square, and 300 dpi so it will look good.








, If you want, you can also draw in a static background on this layer that will appear in every frame.








, This will be the first ""page"" of the flipbook. We'll use a simple face drawing for this example, and move it from a serious face to a happy face.








, When you're done drawing on Layer 1, duplicate it, and then set the opacity of Layer 1 to 20%. It will appeared grayed out, making it easy to see your drawing on the next layer.








, Erase out the parts of the first layer you don't want to keep, and draw in the new positions for those elements. In this example, we erased the eyebrows, pupils, and mouth, and made small changes in each.








, Repeat the process of erasing the moving elements, and drawing in the next step in the motion until you reach your final frame.









When you're done with your tracing, make sure you set the opacity of every layer to 100%

, There are a couple ways you can turn your drawing into a flipbook. The first is to make only one layer at a time (plus the background) visible, print it out, and then switch to the next layer. When you have all the images printed out, trim off the excess paper, staple the pages together, and flip.









Trimming the paper is an important step, best accomplished with a paper cutter, not scissors. You will want every page to line up exactly on the ""flipping"" edges, so your flips work.

, Instead of using paper to make a flipbook, you might be able to make a little mini-movie. If your drawing program has the option to create animation, check out the user guide for the best way to accomplish that, but the basic process is this: create a frame for each step of the animation, and turn on only those layers you wish visible for that frame.









In this example, we enabled the background layer for every frame, and set each frame to a single other layer: Layer 1, Layer 1 copy, Layer 1 copy 2, etc.
Set your loop count as desired—once, 10 times, endlessly—however long you want to enjoy your animation.

, When you're done, use the export function and save your flipbook as a video file that you can put on YouTube for the world to see!

Then, select your ""Bucket Fill Tool"" from the toolbar and fill the white part with whatever color you want your lightsaber to be., For a standard quality picture (480x640p.) select a blur radius of 20. This will create a glow, but it will be kind of faint. Duplicate the glow layers using the method mentioned in step five until you have a good looking glow., Your ""Layers"" window will be kind of crammed by now, so right click on the top layer and hit ""Merge Down"". Repeat this for all layers, until the background and all lightsaber layers are merged into one., You should now have a good looking lightsaber. But what if you want to add a clash for when two lightsabers touch?, Set the supernova center to where the lightsabers meet., Set the ""Radius"" to whatever you want, and set the ""Rays"" to 25, set the ""Color"" to a nice yellowish-orange, and set ""Color Randomness"" to zero., There is only one way to do this. It's called rotoscoping., Do this enough times, and you  have a good-looking lightsaber sequence. Happy rotoscoping!"

Write a treatment.,
Write a script.,
Storyboard your script.,
Assess your storyboard.,
Sketch your designs.,
Record your dialogue.",How to Animate Your Own Show1," Come up with a story and set down the general overview without worrying about how to execute it just yet. Include characters, settings, and action.


Keep it short. Animation takes a while. If you’re a beginner, aim for a two-minute video or less.
Keep it simple. Save the epic space battle for when you have more experience. Start with a low-key exchange between two characters in a single setting.
Watch HISHE’s Super Cafe segments for a great example of a short and simple cartoon.;
, Take the basic ingredients from your treatment and specify exactly what you would like to see onscreen. Include dialogue, sound effects, establishing shots, fade-ins, fade-outs, etc.


Specify elements that are essential to your story, especially if you’re working on a team. Keep everyone clear on the specifics. For instance, if at the end your cartoon a character flattens an empty soda can on his forehead, specify from the start that they’re drinking from a can of soda, and not just “drinking soda.”

, Map your story out visually by drawing panels for each shot, like a comic strip. Keep it simple for time’s sake; use stick-figures for characters and simple geometric shapes for objects., Determine which elements are in the background, middle-ground, and foreground respectively. Also determine which elements will remain static throughout a shot and which will be in motion.


Think in terms of labor. More elements in motion will require more time spent animating them. Minimize the amount of work you have to do by recomposing shots to minimize the amount of movement within each one. For instance, if two characters get into a fistfight while others watch on, have the shot focus on the onlookers’ reactions while using sound effects to indicate the brawl off-camera.

, Draw each element that appears in your storyboard until you’re happy with how it looks. Once you’re happy with it, draw it a few more times for practice until you can replicate your design perfectly.


For each element that moves from panel to panel, draw it from every angle in which it’s seen. For example, draw each character facing the “camera,” then with their back to the camera, and again in profile; if any aspect of their appearance is asymmetrical (like a side part in their hair), draw each side’s profile.
Keep your designs simple. Again, think in terms of labor. Refrain from drawing too many details that will need to be replicated again and again.
Watch The Simpsons for an example of simple, easy-to-replicate designs.

, Either record each line separately on your computer or tablet and save it as its own audio file, or record the whole conversation and then splice each line into its own audio file.

Practice.",How to Animate," For simple animations, such as a flipbook, you can probably plan everything in your head, but for more complex work, you need to create a storyboard. A storyboard resembles an oversized comic strip, combining words and pictures to summarize the overall story or a given part of it.If your animation will use characters with complicated appearances, you’ll also need to prepare model sheets showing how they appear in various poses and full-length.;
, It usually isn’t necessary, or cost-effective, to have every object in the story move in order to tell the story effectively. This is called limited animation.For a cartoon depicting Superman flying, you may want to show only the Man of Steel’s cape flapping and clouds whizzing from the foreground into the background on an otherwise static sky. For an animated logo, you may want to have only the company name spin to call attention to it, and then for only a fixed number of times, so that people can read the name clearly.
Limited animation in cartoons has the disadvantage of not looking particularly lifelike. For cartoons targeted to young children, this is not as much of a concern as in animated works intended for an older audience.

, Certain actions can be broken down into sequential renderings that can be re-used multiple times in an animation sequence.Such a sequence is called a loop.Actions that can be looped include the following:


Ball bouncing.
Walking/running.
Mouth movement (talking).
Jumping rope.
Wing/cape flapping.

,, A flipbook consists of a number of sheets of paper, usually bound at one edge, that creates the illusion of motion when you grasp the opposite edge with your thumb and flip through the pages. The more sheets of paper in the flipbook, the more realistic the motion appears to be. (A live-action motion picture uses 24 frames/images for each second, while most animated cartoons use 12.) You can make the actual book one of several ways:


Staple or bind sheets of typing or construction paper together.
Use a notepad.
Use a pad of sticky notes.

, You can make the images in your flipbook animation one of several ways:Draw them by hand. If you do this, start with simple images (stick figures) and backgrounds and gradually tackle more complex drawings. You’ll need to take care that the backgrounds are consistent from page to page to avoid a jittery appearance when you flip the pages.
Photographs. You can take a number of digital photos, then print them out on sheets of paper and bind them together, or use a software application to create a digital flipbook. It’s easiest to do this if your camera has a burst picture mode that lets you take a number of pictures as you hold down the button.
Digital video. Some newlywed couples choose to create coffee-table flipbooks of their wedding, using a portion of the video shot during their wedding. Extracting individual video frames requires using a computer and video editing software, and many couples choose to upload their videos to online companies such as FlipClips.com.

, If you’ve been hand-drawing the images in an already-bound notepad, the assembly is done for you. Otherwise, arrange the images with the first image at the bottom of the stack and the last image at the top and bind the sheets together.


You may want to experiment with leaving out or rearranging a few of the images to make the animation appear jerkier or change the animation pattern before you bind the book together.

, Bend the pages upward with your thumb and release them at an even speed. You should see a moving image.


Pen-and-ink animators use a similar technique with preliminary drawings before coloring and inking them. They lay them one on top of each other, first to last, then hold down one of the edges as they flip through the drawings.

, Most animation projects created through pen-and-ink animation require a large team of artists to produce. This requires creating a storyboard to guide the animators, as well as to communicate the proposed story to producers before the actual drawing work begins.

, Because it’s easier to coordinate an animated sequence to a soundtrack than a soundtrack to an animated sequence, you need to record a preliminary, or “scratch” soundtrack consisting of these items:


Character voices
Vocals to any songs
A temporary musical track. The final track, along with any sound effects, are added in post-production.
Animated cartoons before and into the 1930s did the animation first, then the sound. The Fleischer Studios did so in their earliest Popeye cartoons, which required the voice actors to ad-lib in between scripted places in the dialogue. This accounts for Popeye’s humorous mutterings in cartoons such as “Choose Your Weppins.”

, This reel, or animatic, synchronizes the soundtrack with the storyboard to find and fix timing errors in either the soundtrack or the script.


Advertising agencies make use of animatics as well as photomatics, a series of digital photographs sequenced together to make a crude animation. These are usually created with stock photos to keep the cost down.

, These sheets show the characters and items from a number of angles, as well as the style in which the characters are to be drawn. Some characters and items may be modeled in three dimensions using props called maquettes (small scale models).


Reference sheets are also created for the backgrounds needed for where the action takes place.

, Go over the animatic to see what poses, lip movements, and other actions will be necessary for each frame of the story. Write these poses in a table called an exposure sheet (X-sheet).


If the animation is primarily set to music, such as ‘’Fantasia’’, you can also create a bar sheet to coordinate the animation to the notes of the musical score. For some productions, the bar sheet can substitute for the X-sheet.

, Animated cartoons are laid out similar to the way a cinematographer blocks out scenes in a live-action movie. For large productions, groups of artists devise the background appearance in terms of camera angles and paths, lighting, and shading, while other artists develop the necessary poses for each character in a given scene. For smaller productions, the director may make all these determinations.

, This animatic is composed of the storyboard and layout drawings, with the soundtrack. When the director approves it, the actual animation begins.

, In traditional animation, each frame is drawn in pencil on transparent paper perforated on the edges to fit into the pegs on a physical frame called a peg bar, which in turn is attached to either a desk or a light table. The peg bar keeps the paper from slipping so that each item in the scene being rendered appears where it is supposed to.


Usually only the key points and actions are rendered first. A pencil test is made, using photos or scans of the drawings synchronized with the soundtrack to make sure the details are correct. Only then are the details added, after which they, too, are pencil-tested. Once everything has been so tested, it is sent to another animator, who redraws it to give it a more consistent look.
In large productions, a team of animators may be assigned to each character, with the lead animator rendering the key points and actions and assistants rendering the details. When characters drawn by separate teams interact, the lead animators for each character work out which character is the primary character for that scene, and that character is rendered first, with the second character drawn to react to the first character’s actions.
A revised animatic is created during each phase of drawing, roughly equivalent to the daily “rushes” of live-action movies.
Sometimes, usually when working with realistically drawn human characters, the frame drawings are traced over stills of actors and scenery on film. This process, developed in 1915 by Max Fleischer, is called rotoscoping.

, As the frames are being drawn, the background drawings are turned into “sets” for photographing the character drawings against. Today usually done digitally, painting can be done traditionally with one of several media:


Gouache (a form of watercolor with thicker pigment particles)Acrylic paint
Oil
Watercolor

, Short for “celluloid,” cels are thin, clear sheets of plastic. As with the drawing paper, their edges are perforated to fit onto the pegs of a peg bar. Images can be traced from the drawings with ink or photocopied onto the cel. The cel is then painted on the reverse side using the same kind of paint to paint the background.


Only the image of the character on object on the cel is painted; the rest is left unpainted.
A more sophisticated form of this process was developed for the movie ‘’The Black Cauldron.’’ The drawings were photographed on high-contrast film. The negatives were developed onto cels covered with light-sensitive dye. The unexposed portion of the cel was chemically cleaned, and small details were inked by hand.

, All the cells are placed on the peg bar; each cel carries a reference to indicate where it is placed on the stack. A sheet of glass is laid over the stack to flatten it, then it is photographed. The cels are then removed, and a new stack is created and photographed. The process is repeated until each scene is composed and photographed.


Sometimes, instead of placing all the cels on a single stack, several stacks are created and the camera moves up or down through stacks. This kind of camera is called a multiplane camera and is used to add the illusion of depth.
Overlays can be added over the background cel, over the character cels, or on top of all the cells to add additional depth and detail to the resulting image before it’s photographed.

, The individual images are sequenced together as film frames, which, when run in sequence, produce the illusion of motion., As with other forms of animation, a storyboard provides a guide to the animators and a means to communicate to others how the story is to flow.

, As with pen-and-ink animation, stop-motion animation relies on creating numerous pictures of images to be displayed in rapid sequence to produce the illusion of motion. Stop-motion animation, however, normally uses three-dimensional objects, although this is not always the case. You can use any of the following for stop-motion animation:


Paper cut-outs. You can cut or tear pieces of paper into parts of human and animal figures and lay them against a drawn background to produce a crude two-dimensional animation.
Dolls or stuffed toys. Best known with Rankin-Bass’ animated productions such as ‘’Rudolph, The Red-Nosed Reindeer’’ or ‘’Santa Claus Is Coming to Town’’ and Adult Swim’s ‘’Robot Chicken’’, this form of stop-motion dates back to Albert Smith and Stuart Blackton’s 1897 ‘’The Humpty Dumpty Circus.’’ You’ll have to create cutouts for the various lip patterns to attach to your stuffed animals if you want to have them move their lips when they speak, however.
Clay figures. Will Vinton’s Claymation animated California Raisins are the best-known modern examples of this technique, but the technique dates back to 1912’s ‘’Modelling Extraordinary’’ and was the method that made Art Clokey’s Gumby a TV star in the 1950s. You may need to use armatures for some clay figures and pre-sculpted leg bases, as Marc Paul Chinoy did in his 1980 film ‘’I go Pogo’’.
Models. Models can be either of real or fantasy creatures or vehicles. Ray Harryhausen used stop-motion animation for the fantastic creatures of such movies as ‘’Jason and the Argonauts’’ and ‘’The Golden Voyage of Sinbad’’. Industrial Light & Magic used stop-motion animation of vehicles to make the AT-ATs walk across the icy wastes of Hoth in ‘’The Empire Strikes Back’’.

, As with pen-and-ink animation, you’ll need to have a scratch soundtrack to synchronize the action to. You may need to create an exposure sheet, a bar sheet, or both.

, As with pen-and-ink animation, you want to work out the timing between the soundtrack and the animation before you start moving objects around.


If you plan to have speaking characters, you’ll have to work out the correct mouth shapes for the dialog they’re to utter.
You may also find it necessary to create something similar to the photomatic described in the section about pen-and-ink animation.

, This part of stop-motion animation would also be similar to how a cinematographer blocks out a live-action movie, even more so than for pen-and-ink animation, since you’re most likely working in three dimensions as in a live-action movie.


As with live-action film, you’ll more likely have to be concerned with actually lighting a scene as opposed to drawing in the effects of light and shadow as you would in pen-and-ink animation., You’ll probably want to have your camera mounted on a tripod to keep it steady during the shooting sequence. If you have a timer that lets you take pictures automatically, you may want to use it if you can set it for long enough periods to let you adjust the components during the scene.

, Repeat this until you have completed photographing the entire scene from start to finish.


Animator Phil Tippett developed a way to have some of the moving of models controlled by computer to produce more realistic motions. Called “go motion,” this method was used in ‘’The Empire Strikes Back’’, as well as in ‘’Dragonslayer’’, ‘’RoboCop’’, and ‘’RoboCop II’’., As with photographed cels in pen-and-ink animation, the individual shots from stop-motion animation become film frames that produce the illusion of motion when run one after the other.

, Computer animation makes doing either two-dimensional or three-dimensional animation easier than doing the work by hand.


Three-dimensional animation requires learning additional skills besides animation. You’ll need to learn how to light a scene, and also how to create the illusion of texture., How much computer you need depends on whether you’re doing 2-D or 3-D animation.


For 2-D animation, a fast processor is helpful, but not absolutely necessary. Nonetheless, get a quad-core processor if you can afford it, and at least a dual-core processor if you’re buying a used computer.For 3-D animation, however, you want the fastest processor you can afford because of all the rendering work you’ll do. You’ll also want to have a significant amount of memory to support that processor. You’ll more than likely spend several thousand dollars on a new computer workstation.For either form of animation, you’ll want as large a monitor as your planned work area can accommodate, and you may want to consider a two-monitor setup if you have several detail-oriented program windows open at once. Some monitors, such as the Cintiq, are designed specifically for animation.You should also consider using a graphics tablet, an input device connected to your computer with a surface you draw on with a stylus, such as the Intuos Pro, in place of a mouse. Starting out, you may want to use a cheaper stylus pen to trace over your pencil drawings to transfer images to your computer., Software is available for both 2-D and 3-D animation, with inexpensive options available for beginners and more sophisticated and more costly options you can migrate to as your budget and skill directs.


For 2-D animation, you can produce animated images quickly using Adobe Flash, with the help of one of the many free tutorials available. When you’re ready to learn to animate frame-by-frame, you can use a graphics program like Adobe Photoshop or a program that has a feature similar to Photoshop’s Timeline feature.
For 3-D animation, you can start with free programs like Blender and then move on to more sophisticated programs such as Cinema 4D or the industry standard, Autodesk Maya., Immerse yourself in the software you’ve chosen to use, learning how to create with it and then actually sitting down and creating animations of your own. Compile these animations into a demonstration reel that you can show to others, either one-on-one or online.

When exploring your animation software package, take a look at “Part Three: Creating Pen-and-Ink Animation” if your software is for 2-D animation and “Part Four: Creating Stop-Motion Animation” to determine what portions of the process the software will automate for you and what portions you’ll have to do outside of it.
You can post videos to your own website, which should be registered either under your own name or that of your business.
You can also post to a site such as YouTube or Vimeo. Vimeo allows you to change which video you’re posting without changing the link to it, which can be helpful when you’ve created your latest masterpiece."

Familiarize yourself with its functions and features. Learn how to duplicate frames and manipulate the number of frames seen per second.

, Decide on a rate of frames that will be seen per second. Then perform each action that your characters enact and time yourself with a stopwatch to determine how many seconds it takes.. For each action performed, multiply the number of seconds it takes to complete by the number of frames seen per second to determine how many frames you’ll need to draw for each action.


Also determine how many frames each line of recorded dialogue will require to animate. If the dialogue is spoken at a normal speed from start to finish, simply check the timeline for each line. If one word or more is stretched out, however, check how long each syllable is prolonged. For example, imagine an announcer shouting, “Goooaaal!” at a soccer match; the shape of the announcer’s mouth will form the vowel sound for much longer than it will with the consonants.

, Use regular drawing paper to outline and color in the background for each scene.

, For each element that appears in the middle- or foreground of the first frame, lay an acetate sheet over the original design and trace the outline. Break it down into moving parts versus static parts and trace each separately on its own acetate sheet; for example, draw the base of a fan (static) on one sheet and the fan’s rotors (moving) on another. Then flip the sheet over and color in the outline on the back of the sheet., Secure your background to a rostrum with a small amount of blue tack. Layer your acetate sheets in order on top of it, from middle- to foreground. Mount a digital camera directly above, aiming down, and photograph.Take a test shot or two to make sure your camera is distanced far enough to capture the whole image.Choose a clean environment with controlled lighting for photographing. Avoid natural light, whose quality may change. Also avoid dusty or dirty environments, since particles may be trapped between acetate sheets and visible on camera., Reuse acetate sheets whose elements do not alter. Create new ones for elements that move from one frame to the next. Layer your sheets in order on top of your background and photograph. Repeat this step until the end of your shot.


Keep a checklist of elements for each frame. Double-check that all are present before photographing.

, Once a shot is complete, transfer your photos from your camera to your device. Create a new folder for each shot in your photo library and label each image numerically, in sequence, for easy reference (for example: “Scene 1; Frame 1,” “Scene 1: Frame 2,” etc.).

, For each shot, open a new file in your animation app. Import the first image from your photo library into the first frame. Add a second frame, import the second image, and repeat. Once you’re finished, export the file to your video library.

, Create a new movie in a video-editing program like iMovie. Import each shot and arrange in sequence. Import audio files for dialogue, music, and/or sound effects, and sync each to the video.

Use a tablet if you have one. Drawing directly on a screen is often preferred by artists., Familiarize yourself with the program’s functions and features. Sample the different kinds of brushes it offers. Learn how to duplicate frames, add more layers per frame, and change the rate of frames seen per second.


Practice by animating a stick figure running in place. In the first frame, draw the whole body in a single layer. Add a second frame. With most apps, a new blank frame will appear as a translucent “onion skin” so you can trace the previous frame underneath it. Trace the stick figure’s head and upper torso on the second frame. Next, draw the arms so that one arm rises slightly forward, while the other falls behind. Do the same with the legs. Add a third blank frame. Trace the head and upper body as before and alter the position of each arm and leg again. Continue the process until you’ve created enough frames for your stick figure to run a few strides, then play it back to watch.
Practice drawing in layers next. Animate another stick figure running in place, only this time draw the head and upper torso in a single layer. Add a second layer to the first frame to draw the arms. Add a third layer and draw the legs. Then duplicate the first frame so you now have two identical frames. In the second frame, erase the arms in the second layer and draw them in new positions. Do the same with the legs in the third layer. Duplicate the second frame and repeat the process until your stick figure runs a few strides, without you ever having to draw the head and upper torso more than once.

, Choose the screen ratio that you prefer for your opening shot. In your first frame, create layers for your foreground, middle-ground, and background respectively.


Depending on your app, you may be able to create even more layers; Animation Creator HD, for instance, offers four layers per frame. Feel free to create multiple middle-grounds.

, Think in layers and determine which elements will occupy the foreground, middle-ground(s), and background respectively. Identify which elements will occupy more than one.


Imagine a person seated at a table, facing the camera, with their elbow resting on the table and a can of soda in their hand. To animate them raising the can to their lips for a sip, think of the arm and soda as your foreground, the table and the rest of the character’s body as the middle-ground(s), and the area behind them as the background.

, Use a stylus to draw each element in the foreground, middle-ground(s), and background respectively.


Think ahead. Keep in mind which elements will move from frame to frame, possibly revealing details that are currently blocked from view in the first frame. For example, when a character raises their beverage, their raised arm may reveal more of their body.

, In the new frame, alter the elements in each layer as dictated by your storyboard.

, Play your animation back as you add and alter more and more frames. To slow your animation down, either duplicate each frame without altering any elements, or reduce the number of frames seen per second. To speed it up, add the number of frames seen per second.

, Once you’ve finished each shot, export it to your video library. Open a video-editing app (like iMovie) and create a new ""movie"" to edit. Import your first animated shot from your video library.

, Import each one into the editing app. Add them in sequence to your video.

, Sync any dialogue, music, and/or sound effects to the video.

, Use a rigid material to prepare your background, like cardboard, wood, or preferably pinboard; whichever you use, be sure that it will fit on the rostrum for your camera. Make cutouts for each element in your background. Glue elements that remain static throughout your shot to the background. Use blue tack to fix any that move, such as clouds.For elements with moving parts, create separate cutouts for those parts that move. For example, with a flagpole, the pole itself will remain static while the flag may flap or be raised or lowered. Glue the pole’s cutout to your background and use blue tack to fix the flag., Determine how mobile your character will be. Decide how many joints each limb will have; for example, will the arm be jointed at both the shoulder and elbow, or only the shoulder? Make separate cutouts for each moving part, leaving a small tab at the end of each limb to be secured to the main body with either blue tack or butterfly clips., Arrange your characters on your background, along with any additional cutouts you’ve made for the foreground. Use blue tack to secure each to the background. Mount a digital camera to your rostrum directly above your scene and photograph it.Take a test shot or two to make sure your camera is distanced far enough to capture the whole image., Rearrange each element that moves from your first frame to the next.

Each picture is shown quickly; several pictures are shown to you each second, making it look like the images are moving. This happens in real live movies also, except the pictures aren't drawn, but taken.;
,, Click ""Next Frame"".

, You'll notice there is a gray mark where the figure last was, it's supposed to help you out if you get lost, and if you accidentally delete the figure, you can easily put it back in place.

, Make sure it's long...300-400 frames maybe. Save it as a .piv, then a .GIF.

, Open up Windows Movie Maker (to find it, search your computer). Click ""Import Pictures"", import your .gif animation. Drag it into the video section. Now import some music, and drag it into the audio/music section. Click ""Save to my computer"" and there you have it! You can also do this with a microphone: click the microphone icon in the movie maker. Click ""Start Narration"" and talk into your microphone along with the animation. Click done and the sound will be added!

, Start with 1 frame, have a circle on one side of the animation... click ""Next Frame"", then move the circle to the other side. Click ""Next Frame"" and save it on repeat. Now watch it. You'll notice that the animation never ends. Import it into Windows Movie Maker, drag it into the ""Video"" Section, keep dragging it in. That way you can control how many times it repeats itself. This gets harder the more frames you have it on... you need to drag the figure (frame by frame) to the location it started out. It takes some practice... but you'll eventually get it.

Create a new animation folder for the final lines and colors above your rough animation layer or go to ""Layer > Create folder and insert layer"" for each rough cel (You might want to make a shortcut or auto action to make this much quicker).,
Export your animations as a .avi if you’re using Windows and .mov if you’re using Mac by going to ""File > Export Animation >Movie... "" Note that only the parts between the blue markers will be exported.",How to Animate in Clip Studio Paint,"


Choose the settings. The only ones that really matter are the size, resolution, frame rate, and size of the blue borders. Anything outside of the blue borders does not get exported.;
, Alternatively, click the ""Enable onion skin"" icon on the timeline. This will show a translucent version of the frames before and after the one you're working on which makes it much easier to animate.


You can change onion skin colors as well as the amount of frames seen by going to ""Animation > Show Animation cells > Onion Skin settings...""

, Make a new cel by creating a new layer for the next drawing. You must assign each animation cel or folder to a frame before you can draw on it. You can do this by right clicking and selecting the cel or clicking on specify cels and selecting the cel. Alternatively, you can select the frame you want the animation cel to be on and click “new animation cel” and it will create a cel on that frame for you.

, Click on “Enable Light Table” and then choose between common light table(shows for all the cels) and light table specific (only shows up when editing that specific cel). While this isn't needed for a simple animation of a ball falling, it is useful for referring to key frames and references to keep animations consistent


Drag layers into the light table sections or import images to register that cel. This allows you to flip between specific frames.







, This doesn’t actually delete the cel from the file, just removes it from the animation. You have to click at the beginning of the cel in the timeline in order to delete it or else the icon will be greyed out and unclickable.

, Make sure to do this for the paper and background layers when extending the duration or else they will be transparent later on.


Adjust the blue lines which show the end and beginning of where you want to play. You can click loop play if you want to watch it over and over.
Select specific cels by holding command. You can extend or shorten all at the same time.

, If you choose the first method, you have to re-assign cels in the timeline to match that of your rough animation. If you choose the second method, make sure to hide or delete the rough animation cel.

,

You can export it as a gif as well, but keep in mind that the colors will be limited to 256 colors per frame. You can check the dithering option for a smoother blending, but it will increase the file size of your gif.
You can export your animation cels by going to ""File > Export Animation > Export animation cels…"" All visible cels within the animation folders will be exported and separated into different folders depending on what animation folder it is.

Decide what you are going to animate Before you start drawing, you'll need to come up with a good (better, a great!),
Storyboard your script (reducing it to a series of cartoon-like drawings).,
Begin animating!.,
Draw your first frame (or, import a photograph).,
Save it into the image software you are using (or, better, paste it into an animation software package).,
Make any adjustments you wish to make for the next cel.,
Import the saved photos (or, better, the animation file) into Windows Movie Maker (MM).,
Add titles and special effects.,
Add sound; it is essential for an effective film.,
Don't forget Ambient sound.,
Search for examples of animation using the software mentioned in this article.",How to Animate With MS Paint and Windows Movie Maker," story. wikiHow has several such entries to guide you; ""How to write a short story"" is a good place to start. Remember, effective stories have...an introduction, complications, and a resolution.;
, See articles elsewhere in wikiHow for tips on storyboarding.

, Open MS Paint (or any image processing software, such as JASC Paint Shop Pro). PSP is fairly straightforward, although there is a learning curve. Most importantly, in PSP you can add the bits that will move in your animation, as layers. Then, you move the layer to get the effect of movement (vs. redrawing your entire frame, or ""cel"").

, Be sure to make it look just the way you wanted it, or you'll hate the end result, and you will have wasted your time.

, GIF Animator (GIF-A) is free and, for your first animation, it's recommended. You might also look at JASC Animator (the 'trial' version never seems to expire). Animation programs will speed your progress in far too many ways to itemize here.

, Usually (but not always) you will not make them drastic. This is animation, so you need to take it a step at a time. Each cel will usually be just slightly different from the last one. If you have learned about 'layers' and are using PSP, this will be accomplished with a flick of your mouse.

, Do this when you have your scenes finished. Drag them down onto the story board. You will probably iterate this step many times, until you get your creation just right.

, Once you have all the visuals exactly as you like them, then is the time to add special effects, credits, a title, anything you need.

, While MM does have a sound editor, it is buggy, very difficult to modify, and is prone to hanging without warning (often requiring a complete reboot). You can edit your sound in any separate sound editing software (like Cooledit, but any comparable package should do), then drop the entire file into MM. You can download for free very nearly any type of sound you need, off the net.

, This is the incidental background sound, usually, some sort of a dull murmur; if you have none, the effect of going from ""talking"" to ""complete silence"" is jarring. You can put a soundtrack in the background, but, failing that, you should never (well, hardly ever) have a complete lack of sound. This is another time sound processing software like Cooledit proves its use: you put your ambient (or, your music) soundtrack on one channel, and your speech and sound effects on the second.

, See www.youtube.com (and search there for ""nzfilmprof""). ""Kiwi Kids"" has samples of young students using Paint; and other examples done with PSP.

Set up your camera.,
Begin taking photographs.,
Check your software.,
Look for an Onion Skinning feature.,
Finish shooting.,
Duplicate frames so the movements happen at a slower pace.,
Finish your film.",How to Create a Stop Motion Animation1," You can use a quality camera if you own one, but a cheap webcam works surprisingly well. Buy one with a manual focus ring, so you can adjust the focus to get sharp, close up images. You can find these online for as low as $5 USD.

Make sure you can attach the webcam to your device. On a mobile device, you will likely need to purchase a cable, and install an app that allows you to use webcams.
Some of the software recommended below will only work with webcams, or certain cameras. Check for compatibility before you spend your money.;
, You can install this on just about any device, although laptops and mobile devices are the easiest to transport around your film set. Many stop motion programs have a free trial period, so you can try them out before you buy. Read the terms first, as the trial may restrict your options, or cover your images with a watermark. Here are a few suggestions:

For Mac: iStopMotion, Boinx, Dragon Frame
For Windows: I Can Animate 2 (recommended for children), iKITMovie, or Stop Motion Pro. Windows Movie Maker is an option with fewer features, but it may already be on your computer.
For iPhone or iPad: Frameographer, Stopmotion Cafe
For Android devices: Clayframes, Stopmotion Studio

, Some good choices include clay, wire, LEGO or similar building block figures. Be imaginative; you can use almost any object to make your movie.


Start with a small project, such as an orange peeling itself. One second of film can take 18–24 photos, so you'll get plenty of practice from this.
You can draw on a whiteboard or stack of paper instead, changing the drawing slightly with every frame. If you do this, set up a stable stand to hold the drawings, so there's no accidental movement.

, You can use any lights, as long as they don't flicker or change in brightness. You may need to block outside light with blinds or curtains, if clouds or other moving shadows are causing changes in brightness.

Some light bulbs take a while to reach full brightness. Leave them on to warm up while you get ready.

, Set up your first shot in an area without wind or background movement. Make sure all your pieces stand up on their own. If one of them falls over during filming, it can take quite a while to set it back up in the exact position.

If a figure is tilting or threatening to fall over, stick it onto the surface with poster tack.

, Take your camera and device to the location you'll be shooting. Connect your webcam or camera to your device. Open your software and confirm that it ""sees"" the webcam image. Once you've worked out any kinks, set the camera on a tripod, or tape it down firmly to prevent motion. If the camera shakes as you take photos, the movie will appear chaotic and lack continuity., Take a single photo of the objects or figures in the starting position. Move the objects bit by bit, by a very small amount each time, and take another photograph after each movement. You can move one piece at a time (such as an arm waving back and forth), or make several movements at once (a more fluid walk involving legs and arms, or several objects moving in a busy scene). Try to move an object by about the same distance each time.

Before taking each photograph, make sure the object is in sharp focus. You may need to disable your camera's autofocus. If using a webcam, rotate the focus ring by hand.

, Each time you take a photograph, a frame should appear in your stop motion software. These frames are placed in a row to form a strip of film, usually near the bottom of your screen. You should be able to flick between the frames or play a video to get a rough idea of what your movie will look like. Don't worry, the end result will be much smoother.

If you make a mistake, just delete the frame you just took and take another photograph.

, This extremely useful feature is one major reason to use dedicated stop motion software instead of a free movie editor. With Onion Skinning enabled, the previous frame shows up as a faint image on the screen, overlaying the image your camera sees. This lets you arrange objects accurately, seeing exactly how much they will move on screen. If you knock over a figure or make a mistake and need to re-shoot a few frames, Onion Skinning makes it easy to return to the old scene by lining up the figures with the faint image.

If you can't find this feature, look for a Help or Tutorial section, or visit the website of the software developers.

, Continue moving and photographing until the scene is finished. Save your work frequently. Leave your setup in place once you're done, in case you need to retake some photographs.

There's no need to finish the scene in one sitting. Taking regular breaks will help make the process a pleasure instead of a chore.

, If you duplicate a frame, that frame will stay still for a tiny bit longer before moving. As a general rule, stick to one or two copies of each frame. Occasionally, slow this down to 6–8 frames between movements, so an object pauses before changing directions or starting a new motion. This looks more natural and makes your animation less frantic and easier on the eyes.

If you don't know how to do this, look for instructions for your specific software.

, You can now render the project as a video file and show it to your friends. If you like, you can open the video in video editing software and add music, sound effects, and special effects."

Save your movie.",How to Create a Stop Motion Animation2," You might already have video editing software that came with your computer, and a camera or phone that can take digital photographs. If so, you can jump into this method right away. However, the actual shooting and editing process can be long and difficult. If you want to make anything longer than a minute or two, try the stop motion software method above.

All you need for the easier method above is a free trial of the software and a $5 USD camera.

, Most free video editing software will work. Here are a few options covered in this guide, which you can find online:

For Mac: iMovie (comes pre-installed on some Macs)

For Windows: Virtual Dub, Windows Movie Maker (does not officially support this, but sometimes works; pre-installed on most Windows)


, Find an area with no moving shadows, flickering light, or background movement. Place any objects you like, holding wobbly objects in place with double-sided tape or poster tack.

Stop motion animation takes a long time to make. Start with a short, simple idea, like a piece of paper crumpling itself up and jumping in a trash can.

, You can use any camera, phone, or tablet that takes digital photographs. Place it on a tripod or stand, or tape it down. It must be completely still, or the movie will look jumbled and strange., The basic idea is simple: take a photograph, move the object a tiny bit, then take another one. Check how the image turned out, and take another one if there are any mistakes. You may want to take two or three photos of each position, just in case.

Make sure the objects are in sharp focus. If your camera keeps adjusting the focus distance, you might need to disable auto focus and set it manually.
Move it by the same amount each time.

, Save the pictures on to your computer in an easy to remember place. Leave the file names alone; these should be numbered, so they stay in order.

If you're using a photo application like iPhoto, make a new album first to keep them separate from your other photos.

, Open your video editing software and import the folder containing the pictures you took. This option is usually under File in the top menu, or where described below:

iMovie: Make sure you're in Timeline view. To import the images, click the Photos button and choose your photo album.
Virtual Dub: File → Open → Image Sequence. Select the first image in your album, and Virtual Dub will automatically import all other pictures that follow in numerical order (e.g DCM1000, DCM1001, DCM1002).
Windows Movie Maker: Do not import until after you've set picture duration, as described below.

, This determines how long each image will appear on screen. This works a little differently in each program:

iMovie: When you select your photos, you'll be prompted to enter a time value. Try 0:03 (3/100s of a second) for a smooth, fast video, or 0:10 for a jerky but more relaxed pace.
Virtual Dub: Video → Frame rate. 25 FPS (frames per second) is very smooth and fast, while 5-10 frames per second moves at a slower, jerky pace.
Windows Movie Maker: {{button|Tools} → Options → Advanced → Picture Options. Enter a picture duration (try 0.03 or 0.10). You can now load your images to the storyboard.

, Most video editing software allows you to add a soundtrack, title, credits, and special effects. You can play with these if you like, or skip this to make a silent film. Save frequently as you work.

iMovie: Add dialogue by moving the playhead (downward arrow) to a frame and click Audio → Record. For music, drag a song or sound effect from iTunes onto the audio track of iMovie.
Virtual Dub does not have these features. After exporting, you can open the video file in another program and make these changes.

, To watch your movie, just open the video file.Enjoy your first stop motion project!

Virtual Dub: File → Save as AVI. Your images are now a movie sequence ready for editing in another program, such as Windows Movie maker, Sony Vegas, or Adobe Premiere.

Find a butterfly wing design you like.,
Cut out the mirror image wings.,
Add any decorative effects.,
Attach elastic to the wings for wearing.",How to Make Butterfly Wings2," Trace around it on cardboard and enlarge if needed (see above.)

, If the design was not drawn onto a single piece of cardboard, you'll need to attach the wings at the middle; use either glue or staples to do this.

, For example, paint on spots, stripes or a pattern using liquid glitter, puffy paint, markers, paint, or anything else you like decorating with.


Add embellishments such as sequins, buttons, ribbon bows, etc.

, There are several ways to do this:


Staple two long pieces of thin elastic to the top of the wings, loop around the arms and staple back to the base of the wings.
Staple two long pieces of thin elastic to the middle of the wings. Bring to the front of the wearer and tie a knot and bow to keep in place.

"
"
Design the butterfly wing shape.,
Draw the design in actual size on a piece of strong card.,
Cut out the wing shapes.,
Make a middle piece from the cardboard.,
Attach the cellophane to the wings.,
Attach the wings to the butterfly body.,
Attach elastic to the wings.,
Done!",How to Make Butterfly Wings3," You can copy a real butterfly image or follow a design from a design book or website.


When creating the design, it is important to include areas that can be cut out, such as long shapes or dots on the design, to allow the cellophane to fill these holes. Long teardrop or curved linear shapes are ideal.
The inner edges of the wings that attach to the body piece must be substantial enough to be attached. Give them a decent width to enable gluing or stapling.

, The card should already be in the color you want it to be. Black makes a strong background for cellophane but you might want to use a color to match your costume.


Do two wings, mirror image.

, Also cut out the holes in the design that have been allotted for the cellophane. Depending on how delicate the design is, you might need a craft knife to help with this.

, This is the butterfly's body and will join both wings together. It should be of a reasonable width and about half the length of the wings. Cut it out and put aside; you'll attach the wings to it shortly.

, You have various options:


Use only one color of cellophane. Glue a large piece to the edges of what you consider the be the ""back"" of each wing. Trim excess away from the edges and it's done.
Use multiple colors of cellophane. Glue them over the holes in the wing design that you wish to match to each color.
You can also add glitter or puff paint designs to the cellophane but this is optional.

, Either glue or staple the wings to the body piece.


Adjust as needed to align properly.

, There are several ways to do this:


Staple two long pieces of thin elastic to the top of the wings, loop around the arms and staple back to the base of the wings.
Staple two long pieces of thin elastic to the middle of the wings. Bring to the front of the wearer and tie a knot and bow to keep in place.

, The wings are now ready for take off.

"
"
Draw the wings onto the template board.,
Prepare the wire.,
Cut out the cellophane design.,
Attach the cellophane to the wings.,
Trim the cellophane along the central wire frame.,
Shrink the cellophane to fit the frame tightly.,
Burn the wing edges.,
Attach ribbon or cord for wearing.,
Done.",How to Make Butterfly Wings4," You can be as fanciful as you like but remember that you need to feel competent about matching the wire to the design and bending it to fit.


The main frame of the design should be U shaped, from which you work the design.
The wing veins will flow out from this central frame.

,


Cut a long piece of wire for the central frame. Bend it into a U shape.
Cut small strips of wire and attach to the central frame. Wind onto the central frame, then cover with florist's tape to secure.
Bend the wire like wing veins, in the shape of your pattern.
When both wings are completed, wrap entirely in florist's tape. This prevents catching on sharp parts and gives the whole frame a smoother look.

, Following the design you've mapped out for the wing shape, cut this shape in the sheets of cellophane. Cut 2 sheets of cellophane for each wing.


Depending on your design, the cellophane wings may extend over the wire veins.

, This step requires patience and a willingness to try again if you don't like the result. For each wing, do as follows:


Lay down the first sheet of cellophane. Spray with the sprayable glue.
Lay down the wire frame.
Quickly and carefully lay down the second sheet of cellophane. Try to avoid making bubbles and wrinkles. If this does happen, lift it up and try it again.
Press down on the cellophane sandwich with your fingertips. Be especially careful where the cellophane comes into contact with the frame wires, to prevent tearing and to ensure adequate adhesion. Smooth as you go.

, Leave an edge about 1/4 to 1/2 inch (1-1.5cm). Carefully glue down this edge to join together neatly.


It is easy to burn yourself doing this, so take care and proceed slowly.

, This step is optional, as it's fairly tricky to do and to get it to work without damaging the cellophane. You might like to practice on separate cellophane pieces first. This step applies only to the central frame edge of the cellophane.


On each side of the wings, hold either a heat gun a little over the cellophane to force heat onto it. This will cause it to shrink onto the frame. If you hold the heat source too closely though, the cellophane will warp, bubble and tear, so be careful!
Another alternative is to place something like a face washer over the cellophane, then apply the heat of an iron (set to low). Again, this can be tricky and if you notice damage to the cellophane, stop.

, Again, this step is optional as it involves flames and careful judgment. But for a fancy edge, you might like to try this on the outer, cellophane-only edges of the wings:


Burn small holes or jagged edges using a long match or wood burning tool. Don't keep the flame or heat source in place too long, just long enough to create an interesting feature or shape.
If you'd rather not do this but still want a jagged edge, use fine scissors to make small fringe cuts or use scissors with decorative edges to make interesting edgings.

, Loop ribbon or cord around the wings in a comfortable spot and tie in place. Check that they slip over your arms comfortably.


At the design stage, you could also choose to make the wings in such a way as to fit/slip into your costume top or corset, rather than having to use loops.

, The wire cellophane wings are now ready to wear.

Push the hanger into a butterfly  shape.,
Keep your hand positioned over the center top and bottom of the hanger.,
Bend the hook back on itself to create a circle.,
Repeat the exact same wing design for the other coat hanger.

,

Trim off the excess from each end of the stocking.,
Lay the wings down flat.,
Bring the wings together.,
Wrap around the center with ribbon to cover the taped portion.,
Paint the wings.,
Attach embellishments.,
Add elastic.,
Use the elastic circles to slide onto the wearer's arms.",How to Make Butterfly Wings5," Hold the hanger with one hand at its center. Push the center of the hanger up toward the hanger hook but not too far in; there should still be a gap. This will narrow the hanger to a sort of sausage shape.

, Use your other hand to reshape each end of the hanger into a butterfly wing shape.


Pull the wing parts out, then down.
Make adjustments as needed, to get a wing-like appearance to both ends of the hanger. (The shape is up to you; be creative or imitate an exact butterfly wing shape.)

, Try to avoid the hook end poking out––tuck it in as neatly as you can.

,, (Do the same for both hangers.)


Pull right over the wing. Be careful when pulling over the hook part and try not to rip a hole in it. If it does rip, don't worry too much, just don't let it keep ripping––dab a bit of nail polish on it to stop this from happening.
Knot each end of the stocking onto the hanger. Be sure that the stocking is pulled nice and tight; this makes painting it easier later. When tying the knot, knot before each of stocking ends so as to avoid the blocked part of the stocking from forming part of the wings (these will be snipped off shortly).
Pull the stocking tight from the hook in the center, to even up the edges and to prevent any loose stocking from amassing in the center curve. Then gather this bit tightly with string or ribbon.
The stocking should now sit snugly on the hanger. Repeat for the next hanger.

, Trim close to the knot and discard the trimmed parts of the stocking.

, Bend up at a sharp angle to create an opened effect to the wings. They should stand out when worn.


Do any additional reshaping as required, to ensure that they look like butterfly wings.

, Using the folded hooks to create the center, wrap around the hooks with tape to keep in place.

, Glue the ribbon end to the wrapped tape.

, There are several choices here:


Use fabric paint. Use stripes, dots, patterns, etc. that copy those of real butterflies. Or do random colors and shapes.
Dip the stockings in food coloring.

, This can be anything you like, from glitter and artificial gems to buttons, sequins and other bits and bobs from the craft box.


Artificial flowers are another nice choice, especially added to the center part of the wings.

, You may wish to color or match the elastic to the color of the wings, although this is not necessary. The width of the elastic is also up to you––just make sure it is comfortable and won't cut into the wearer.


Make two large enough circles of elastic to go over the wearer's arms. Knot the circles to keep them intact; trim off any excess.
Slide the knotted circles over a wing each side.

, Adjust to hide the knot, as needed.

Pick a light colored gown or long t-shirt.,
Choose the perfect wings.,
Decide on an eye-catching halo.,
Make your wings.,
Craft your halo.,
Combine the pieces into a costume.,
Add other wardrobe items.,
Accessorize.,
Keep your footwear angelic.",How to Make an Angel Costume," Choose a gown or long t-shirt very light in color. A nice dress, robe or nightgown makes for a great angel costume, but a long t-shirt can also look the part with the right perks; the trick is to achieve an elegant and/or flowing effect.


A light color will help keep your costume “angelic.” Aim for white, light blue, a light yellow or mint green for color. Color hues that are warm, inviting, and comforting mimic light sources that have the same effect. Go all out this year and make your angel costume do the same.Remember, you’re an angel – the flagship of goodness and kindness. Try your best to keep the gown as modest as possible (no white cocktail dresses) or else run the risk of being a devil in disguise!;
, Decide on what type of wings you’d like your angel costume to have. Wings come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes and materials that are only limited by your imagination. The type of wing you choose will determine what resources you’ll need in making them a reality.


Does your angel costume have a fairy wings? Maybe your angel costume is a bit more traditional and requires standard angel wings? Or maybe you’re aiming for something more unique and would like to have balloon wings? Go all out this year and have a memorable set of wings that will have your friends asking how they were made.
Wings only have to be as fancy as you choose them to be. A simple, inexpensive idea is to gather poster board material and cut it into the right shape. With the right amount of tweaks, these can look just as good and be crafted without breaking the bank.
It’s not necessary for the colors of the wings to match your gown exactly, but aim to keep the colors on a similar scale to really unite the costume. You can also go the exact opposite route to have contrasting wings that really stand out.
To get those feathery wings, purchase artificial white feathers and glue a whole bunch of them onto a half heart cardboard, repeat for the other wing.

, Imagine what sort of halo you’d like for your angel costume and get to work on making it a reality. Like wings, a halo can come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes and colors that is only limited by your imagination and ability to craft it.


A simple, inexpensive idea is using a gold or silver pipe cleaner. It’s easy to bend one of decent length into the shape of a halo. What’s more, it’s easy to combine several into a halo of decent length and girth.
You can try basic combinations of common household items to create the halo, such as gold paper and a wire that you can tie it on, or a wire and gold pipe cleaner.
Halloween, party supply stores, and even larger grocery stores carry several types of glow-stick and glowing ring materials perfect for crafting halos. Browse one close to you if you’re looking for extra inspiration.

, The wings are an essential component of what makes an angel costume and, in all likelihood, the most time consuming. Begin with the wing to ensure they’re exactly how you want them and afford time to make any necessary changes.


One of the easiest routes to go down involves simply taking a piece of poster board and crafting paper wings. While it may not initially sound like much, these wings can easily be spruced up by covering them in tin foil before adding your own blend of decoration via paint, glitter, etc. These wings are also easier on your wallet.
Begin by getting a large piece of poster board. These can be found at any local grocery store that sells office supplies.
Draw a large heart on the piece of poster board. Each half of the heart will eventually serve as a single wing, so bear that in mind when buying the piece of poster board and sketching.
Cut around the heart to cut the shape out.
Cut down the middle to have two separate pieces or just fold the heart in half to achieve the effect of wings.
Decorate, draw in detail and customize the paper wings as much as you like to make them your own.
Don't be afraid to get more creative. However, know that, depending on the type of wings you choose to make, crafting your wings can range from being a simple scissor cut to an elaborate process. While balloon wings will take hardly any time at all, fairy wings and elaborate methods of traditional angel wings will require a bit more.

, The halo is the second most recognizable detail of an angel costume. While this item may seem like an intimidating part of the costume, there are a few quick methods to ensure you’ll have a halo in no time.


The easiest way to obtain a halo for your angel costume involves purchasing golden or silver spruced pipe cleaners from any local party supply store. Some grocery stores carry these pipe cleaners as well.
Take a single pipe cleaner and measure out about a foot and a half to two feet. If the pipe cleaners you purchased do not meet this desired length, twist two together.
Separate two to six inches of one end of the pipe cleaner to keep straight for a later portion of the halo making process.
Bend the remainder of the pipe cleaner into a circle.
Point the remaining bit of the pipe cleaner - the straight portion - downward and at a 90 degree angle.
Wrap the remaining bit the pipe cleaner around a headband or solid piece of headwear for ease and comfort.
If necessary, attach the pipe cleaner to an upper portion of your gown.
For a “showier” halo, repeat the process with the pipe cleaners to make the halo appear thicker. You can also attach a necklace or wire lined with jewelry to really give your halo a regal look.
The pipe cleaner method can be used to attach any material to a headband for the sake of a halo. Apply it with whichever material you’ve decided to craft with.

, Attach your wings – and if necessary your halo – to your gown. This can be achieved by sewing the wings on individually, gluing them with a hot glue gun, or simply duct taping the wings to cause less damage to both them and your gown.


To find the perfect “sweet” spot on your back, find the one place on the height of your back where the fabric you’re wearing begins to stretch.
Measure in the mirror – or have a friend measure – the place in your back equidistant from both of your shoulders. This will be the middle of your back. Use your spine for guidance.
How your wings sit on your back is important. Make sure they’re sitting up and straight rather than droopy to really achieve an angelic presence. On the other hand, don’t make the wings too tight, as you may undo the hard work you’ve put in to make them or attach them to your costume.
Use this as the perfect place to perch your wings. The “sweet” spot will not require you to flex your back at all and have the wings remain perched. If it’s a spot too low, the wings will not remain perched and fall. This can cause damage due to movement. If it’s too high, you run the risk of over flexing the material used.

, Adding other items from your wardrobe can really personalize your costume and make it your own. Add a contrasting belt to give your gown more shape, light colored leggings for even more color, or gloves to really bring it home.

, Add your own rings, earrings, bracelets and necklaces to really achieve an elegant angel look. If you’re leery about going out in your finest accessories, consider visiting a costume or party supply store for costume jewelry. You can also add splashes of glitter, light-colored paint or even tin foil to really make the outfit pop.

, Make sure your footwear matches the rest of your outfit. If you’ve gone the traditional angel route, keep the footwear limited to sandals. If you’re going for a more elegant angel look, make sure your footwear is formal, such as simple slip-on white shoes. The last thing you want to do is have your well-crafted costume thrown off by a pair of sneakers.

Set your style with hairspray.",How to Make a Tinkerbell Bun1," Tie it off with a hair tie. The color does not matter because you will be covering it up.If you have bangs, exclude these from the ponytail. You can style them later to create Tinkerbell's poofy bangs.;
, The bun maker should be covering the hair tie, and you hair should be sticking out through the middle of the bun maker. Use a bun maker that is proportionate to you. If you have long, thick hair, use a large one. If you have very thin hair (or styling a child's hair), use a small one., Use your hands to smooth your hair down evenly onto the bun maker. Make sure that there are no gaps showing. If you can see the bun maker through your hair, you might want to switch to a smaller size., This will cinch your hair under the bun maker, creating the perfect bun look. If you need to, shift your hair around so that it covers the bun maker completely.It is best to use a hair tie that matches your hair color.

, Take a small strand of hair and twist it into a rope. Add another small strand to the rope and twist again. Continue adding strands and twisting, working your way around the bun. Tuck the tail end of the rope under the bun, and secure it with bobby pins.If you plan on making false bangs, sweep all of your hair towards your forehead instead. Secure it under the bun with bobby pins so that it stays in place., Tie the ends of the ribbon into a bow at the back of the bun.The exact shade of green does not matter, but it should match your Tinkerbell costume. If you don't have a Tinkerbell costume, go for a bright, spring green. Use a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) wide, satin ribbon if you can., If you are using your own hair to make fake bangs, you can curl it under slightly using a large curling iron.If you are using your own bangs, you can brush or curl them into place; if they are too thin, tease them with a rattail comb., For extra sparkle, try dusting your hair with a small amount of mica or extra-find body glitter."

However, if you don’t or need to buy a new one, you can find them in most stores. For example, H&M has crew neck t-shirts for around $10, and Target’s Merona brand has them for $9.If you are looking to mirror Katniss’ hunting outfit, go for a crew neck or scoop neckT-shirt. If you want to mimic her outfit from the games, though, try to find a v-neck.;
, Throughout most of the movies Katniss sticks to dark colored clothing - mainly blacks and browns. While her hunting outfit is black pants or leggings, during the games she wears dark brown cargo pants. It’s up to you which way you'd like to go.You can find black jeans or jeggings from most stores, though the prices will vary. For example, a nice pair of SEO Sateen X Jeggings from American Eagle will cost you almost $50, while a similar pair from Target is only $20.
Cargo pants, while also available at most stores, will be a bit more expensive. Try a pair like the Sonoma Life & Style Straight Leg Utility pants from Kohl’s.You can also try a pair of dark green pants if you can't find black or brown ones.

, This should be a belt with a thick band, though not so thick that it doesn't go through your belt loops. You also want to make sure it’s a medium brown, and not dark. Try a simple brown leather belt from American Eagle for $15. Make sure to tuck your shirt into your pants so the belt shows.

, These can be either combat or riding boots, as long as they lace all the way up and are flats. If you don't have a pair of these at home, they might be a bit more expensive to buy. For example, most boots cost anywhere between $25-$60. However, Breckelle’s Outlaw 13 Women’s Ankle Strap Tall Riding Boots are only $22.30., Katniss is famous for her brown leather jacket in the first scene of the Hunger Games. However, you can also buy her black windbreaker from when she's actually participating in the games. Though it may seem like the leather jacket would be more expensive, both it and the windbreaker are around the same price.


For example, you can get a Quilted Moto leather jacket from Forever21 for around $37 and a black windbreaker from Colombia.com for $40.You can also try a black leather vest if you don't want to go for the jacket.

, Katniss has long black hair in the books and dark brown hair in the movies, which is about 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) below her shoulders when braided. To get the same style, simply do a curved Dutch braid. A Dutch braid is the same as a French braid, except you are pulling pieces of hair from under rather than over.If you want to match Katniss’ hair color, you can dye your hair with temporary dye or buy a wig.

, This is the pin that Katniss wears on the left side of her shirt. The pin is usually gold, but you can also find it in silver. If you don’t have one at home, try shopping online at Amazon, Toys R Us, or Walmart - you should be able to find one for $14 or much less.


You can also use a circular gold or silver pin if you can't find a Hunger Games-related one.

, You should be able to find these online or in a toy store for around $25, they may just need some modification. For example, in the movies, Katniss' bow and arrows are a dark brown with black feathers. So you may have to spray paint the bow if it's a non-neutral color like orange or red. You may also have to replace the feather's in the arrows if they're an unnatural shade.You can also buy or make your own quiver from felt.

, Throughout most of the movies, Katniss wears very little makeup. To recreate this, try using a neutral eyeshadow like beige or light brown and line your eyes with a black or dark brown eyeliner. You can also apply some bronzer to your cheekbones and finish with a clear or lightly tinted lip gloss.


The trick is to go as natural as possible. You almost want to look like you're wearing no makeup at all.

, Whether you want to recreate Katniss' ""girl on fire"" look that she wears when making her way to the Capitol or her burnt Mockingjay outfit, you first need to start with a dress. For both of these outfits, you want to find a black, dark gray, or navy dress. For the girl on fire ensemble, look for a simple, short black dress with a v-neck and thick straps. On the other hand, to copy the Mockingjay outfit, look for a long, sleeveless, navy dress with a v-neck.If you don't have a little black dress in your closet, try shopping online at H&M or Forever 21. Both stores have black dresses for around $20.
For the longer dress, look at prom or bridesmaid dresses. Since these tend to be expensive, consider renting from a site like Rent the Runway, Garment Exchange, or Style Lend., A lot of Katniss' more glittery looks require some creativity and DIY craft skills to recreate. For example, a number of her dresses are on fire, like the Capitol look. To mirror this, purchase red and orange clip-on LED lights and attach them to the hem of your dress.For the Mockingjay dress, look for angel wings online and then spray paint them blue to match your dress., Outside of her natural look, Katniss' makeup for her interviews and during events is usually striking - her eyes especially. Though a lot of it consists of blacks, dark grays, and silvers, she also uses golds and reds. You can use glitter eyeshadow and even embellish with glue-on sequins, rhinestones, and feathers.


For her Capitol entrance look, try outlining and coloring in your lids with a smoky gray. After this, draw ""wings"" that extend past the corners of your eyes and fill them in with a sparkly gold. Finish with fake eyelashes if you want."

Start with the bodice.,
Create your flutter sleeves.,
Begin working on the skirt.,
Add some trimming to the skirt's top edge.",How to Make a Tinkerbell Costume1," Grab a one-piece swimsuit that fits the wearer and model it after that. Make a pattern by folding the swimsuit in half lengthwise to trace the front piece and then again for the back piece.


Cut out your front and back pieces out of something lime green and stretchy. Sew the front and back pieces together along the sides and bottom, with right sides together.






Turn under the raw edges of the leg holes and use a zig-zag stitch to allow for stretch. Then turn under the arm sections, and the top front and top back sections.;
, You'll need them at least 3 inches wide and 10 inches long -- about double the measurement of the arm. You'll need extra material for gathering. They look like half circles with the top and bottom squared.


Make a casing for the elastic by turning under the long straight edge, about a half inch. Then thread a piece of narrow elastic (to the length of the arm) through the casing.
Then sew the elastic along one end of the casing to secure in place, pull the elastic the rest of the way through, and sew along the other end of the casing to secure the other end of the elastic.
Pin in place and sew several times along the front and back corners of the costume. Repeat with the other shoulder.

, Measure the waist of the wearer and cut a length of material that's about twice as long -- you'll need the extra material for gathering. The length is up to you.


Cut triangle cuts out of the bottom of this piece of material. Sew the shorts ends together, to create a tube, one step closer to a skirt shape.
Create a casing in the same manner that you did for the sleeves and insert the elastic.
You may or may not have to hem the edges, depending on your fabric. If it doesn't fray, you're all set! If it does, take 1/2"" (1.25 cm) and make a seam all along the edge.

, Do this only if you're worried about where the two pieces meet. Be careful if you are sewing on top of the elastic to stretch it as you go. Then if you let go, it will stretch back into place and will ruffle up your trimming a little bit more. Otherwise, if you don’t pull the elastic, you will sew your elastic in place and restrict its elasticity.


A thin length of ruffle can be bought at any fabric store very cheaply. For Tink, go for white or green.

Place the wig on a Styrofoam wig head.,
Wrap a ribbon around the base of the bun.,
Add the final touches.",How to Make a Tinkerbell Bun2," You will be making a separate bun to put on top of the wig, so make sure that the colors match on both. Look for a short bob or pixie-cut wig with long bangs, and loose wig fibers or extensions.You can find both in well-stocked wig shops. The exact shade of blond does not matter; pick something that looks good on you.

If you can't find matching colors, buy a long wig, then cut it. Save the fibers you cut off for making the bun.
Avoid buying cheap wigs from the Halloween or party-supply shop.
Make sure that the fibers on both the wig and extensions are the same type. If they are different, they may not match up in terms of shine.

, Pull all of the loose fibers together and tie them off at one end with a hair tie or rubber band. Trim the ends down above the hair tie so that they are even., Apply a liberal amount of caulk, tacky glue, or fabric glue onto the stub of hair above the hair tie. Really get it into the fibers and onto the hair tie. Don't worry about it not looking pretty--you will be covering this up later on. Allow the caulk or glue to dry completely before moving on.Sealing the top part of the ponytail is important. It will prevent the fibers from coming loose while you style them.

, If you can't find a bun maker, you can make your own by rolling up a piece of fleece, then folding it into a doughnut shape and stitching it together.Use a bun maker that closely matches the ponytail's color.
Bun makers are also called ""hair doughnuts."" They are made from spongy material and shaped like doughnuts.

, Use a curved needle and thread that matches the wig color. You only need to sew through the underside of the bun maker and the base of the ponytail.Leave the loose hairs sticking out of the top of the bun alone for now.

You can also secure the ponytail to the bun maker with fabric glue.

, Take a small section of hair sticking out of the top of the bun maker. Wrap it around the side of the bun maker and hold it in place against the bottom, right by the stub. Stitch it in place using a needle and thread., Keep going until you have used up all of the hairs from the ponytail and the bun maker is completely covered. You may have to go around the bun maker a few times., Unless your ponytail was the perfect length, you will likely have some excess hair extending beyond your stitching. Use a sharp pair of scissors to trim these off., This time, apply the caulk or glue over the stitching and the cut ends of the hair. This will seal the ends of the hair against the bottom of the bun and keep them from coming undone. Avoid getting any glue up the sides of the bun, however, or it will be visible in the end. Let the caulk or glue dry before moving on., If you need to, finish styling the base wig first. You can secure the bun to the wig by carefully stitching it in place. Keep the stitches small, and make sure that you pull the needle through the bottom part of the bun doughnut inside the hair. For a less-permanent option, you can use safety pin or bobby pins., Secure it around the hair line with sewing pins. This will make styling it in the next steps easier., You can use a cloth ribbon or a satin ribbon, whichever matches your Tinkerbell cosplay the base. You can sew the ribbon in place, like a band, or you can tie it into a bow at the back of the bun., Smooth down any stray hairs, then lightly mist the bun with hair spray. If you want to, you can add a light dusting of mica or super-fine body glitter to the wig for extra sparkle."

Cut four 2″ x 4 yd (5 cm by 365 cm) strips from the length of your tulle.,
Start sewing.,
Break out the elastic.,
Put on the finishing touches.",How to Make a Tinkerbell Costume2," This should leave you with four really thin strips and one larger section.


Fold the large piece of tulle in half the long way and then in half the long way again.
Pin along the folded edge of the tulle about 1.5 inches from the fold.

, Sew a straight seam 1″ from the fold along the entire 4 yard (3.7 m) length removing pins as you go. You may want to hold the fabric taut front to back so it doesn’t gather as it runs under the foot. If it bunches a bit, it’s ok.


You will have 2 single layers and 1 double (looped) layer of skirt. Separate the top (single) layer of skirt from the rest and line up the foot of your machine 1″ from the bottom edge. Lay one of the 2″ strips of tulle on top, aligned with the bottom edge of the skirt. Sew down the middle of the strip, pinching the strip to gather as you sew through it and through the skirt. You will use 2 of the 2″ x 4 yard (3.7 m) strips to complete one ruffle along the entire length.
Now lay your third 2″ x 4 yard (3.7 m) strip centered 3″ from the bottom hem, so the 2 ruffles will touch slightly. Sew down the middle of the strip, pinching the strip to gather as you sew through it and through the skirt. You will also use two 2″ x 4 yard (3.7 m) strips to complete the second ruffle along the entire length.

, Run it through the waistband just inside the single back layer of tulle. The 3 layers on the front of the waistband will help hide the elastic.


Be sure to pin the end of your elastic in place. If your elastic is not stiff enough to push through the tulle, you can attach a safety pin to the end of the elastic to help pull it through.
When you string it all the way through, pull the elastic out an inch or two and pin in place.

, Overlap your elastic (to the desired waist measurement) and sew through both pieces of elastic several times. Tuck the elastic ends into the waistband and evenly distribute your gathered waistband.


If your bottom “hem” is uneven, you may want to trim the underlying tulle layers (but only if it bothers you).
Sew on any embellishments you like. These may or may not be seen, since the tutu goes under the skirt.

Bend four wire hangers.,
Pull nylons over all four hangers.,
Grab your spray paint.,
Smear on some glitter glue.,
Cut a length of elastic twice the width of the chest.",How to Make a Tinkerbell Costume3," Tinkerbell has two rounded wings and two pointy wings. Though, of course, you can bend them however you want -- whatever is easiest for you.


For the round wings, open up the hangers. Twist the two together and cut off the excess leaving about two inches (5 cm) of wire near the top bend. That part will be how they attach together, underneath the top set of wings.
For the pointy wings, just cut off the tops of the hangers and stretch the bottoms out. They'll look like diamonds.

, Cut off the thighs, basically using knee highs. Stretch it tight, with all the extra material bunched around the tips of the wires.


Cover the pokey edges with duct tape. Doesn't matter the color; this part will eventually not be seen.
Arrange your wings together. The four duct-taped points should be so you can hold all of them in your hand. The round wings should go below the pointy wings.
Tape the four points together. It's basically a handle at this juncture.

, Tinkerbell has blue wings, but you can use whatever color you like. Lay down newspaper and get into a well-ventilated area.


You may want to concentrate the paint on the tips and edges for a natural, fading look.

, You can either create designs or spread it around with a foam brush. Don't spread it evenly -- it will look better if it's concentrated on the edges and points. Use blue or silver for best results.


Hang it to dry -- after all, they're wet on both sides!

, Sew it together at the ends in a flat loop. This will be how the wings stay on the torso.


Hot glue the loop in the center of your wings on the side that will be facing the back.
Then wrap another piece of fabric (either sprayed nylon or dress fabric) around the center piece, hiding all of the duct tape. Hot glue it into place. You may want to add some glitter to this bit, too.

"
"
Put on the costume.,
Grab a wooden chopstick or wooden spoon for a wand.,
Pull your hair up into a high ponytail.,
Complete the look.",How to Make a Tinkerbell Costume4," The wings should go on before the dress and the tutu slightly under the natural waistline. Grab a pair of light-colored, simple ballet flats to round out the look.

, You might consider using the blue spray paint and some glitter on the spoon too. Of course, you can always buy a wand at the store in the Halloween costumes section or toy aisles, but where's the fun in that?


If you're using a chopstick, cut out two cardboard stars, spray with paint and glitter, and attach them to the end of the wand. Use some ribbon or sequin along the length of the wand if you desire.

, Wrap your hair around your ponytail holder to create a bun and use bobby pins or another hair tie to hold it in place.


Pull the fringe of your hair out of the bun gently to create a ""messy"" look. Considering using thin to medium green ribbon to tie a small bow around the whole thing.

, Use a light, shimmery foundation to emulate Tink's flawless skin. Add green or purple eyeshadow, black mascara and black eyeliner for dramatic eyes if Tink is old enough for makeup!


For a more subtle, earthy look, tone it down a bit and use a shimmery silver eyeshadow and brown mascara and eyeliner. Don't forget the peach blush and light, glimmering pink lip gloss!

Make or purchase swimming fins.,
Make your pattern.,
Cut the fabric.,
Sew the tail.",How to Make a Silicone Mermaid Tail at Home1," Swimming fins and diving fins are similar, but a swimming fin is designed to enforce and enable you to kick and swim like a dolphin. Swimming fins provide greater resistance making them excellent for swimming. Since you are creating a mermaid tail, you will need a swimming fin with a single blade – monofins are the perfect choice. If you do not have enough money to buy mono-fins, you can make mermaid swimming fins by duct-taping two swimming fins together.;
, With the monofin on your feet, simply trace the shape of your legs to fit on a cardboard or card stock to create the pattern for measurements. Note that working on the pattern with measurements will require more math, but this is better as you can get an accurately fitting mermaid tail.

, You need to buy fabric first before you can start making your mermaid tail. Since you are going to make a silicone mermaid tail, you may use nylon spandex for this project. Look for thicker silicone fabrics as the thicker your fabric is, the more realistic your mermaid tail will look like.


Fold the fabric in two to ensure that the side you want is visible for touching, and then trace the pattern onto the fabric. You can use sewer’s chalk, a marker, or pen for tracing the pattern. Use straight pins to pin the traced line so that the two fabrics are joined. 
After joining the two fabrics traced from the pattern, you can now cut them. Just make sure that you give at least a one-inch allowance when you cut the fabric, and cut it using a sharp scissor to achieve a precise and neat cut. You need to ensure that you leave at least one to two inches allowance on the fabric at the top of the waistline area. You must cut the fabric accordingly to the shape of the fin that you choose to use.

, Sew down both sides of the fabric to join them together. Remember to follow your pattern to ensure that you sew the fabric correctly. Remove the straight pins that you used a while ago as you no longer need them.


Sew the fabric to the monofin correctly and sturdily. It can be best if you have a sewing machine to ensure that you sew the mermaid tail accurately. After sewing the monofin and the fabric, you can start sewing the fabric on the waist line area. By putting a zipper on the waistline, you will be able to get off the tail more easily.

Decide on the kind of princess costume you want to make.,
Look up patterns if making from scratch.,
Make a shopping list before heading to the craft store.,
Take your measurements.",How to Make a Princess Costume1," There are many different kinds princesses for you to choose from, but before you start making your costume, you must decide which kind of princess costume you're going to make. You might consider as inspiration for your costume:


Disney princesses.
A fairy princess
A medieval princess;
, Unless you have considerable skill working with fabric already, if you intend to make a more intricate costume using your sewing machine, you should look up patterns to help guide you through the process. Many of these are available free online, along with helpful sewing tips and suggestions., Once you have decided on what kind of princess costume you'll be making, you should make a list of things you'll need to make it, especially if you plan on sewing the costume from scratch. Patterns will usually list materials you will need and tools you use; make a list of your own and take a trip to a local craft store to pick up anything you lack.

, You'll need to know what size to buy clothing in if you're re-purposing garments to make your costume. Should you decide to make a costume from scratch with a sewing machine, you'll need exact measurements to apportion out fabric for sleeves, bodice, etc.

Buy a monofin or swimming feet.,
Make the mold for the scales.,
Complete the mold.,
Make the tail or fluke.,
Complete the Tail/Fluke.",How to Make a Silicone Mermaid Tail at Home2," Choose and buy a suitable monofin, and then create a “sleeve” of neoprene. The latex must have something to adhere to. Break out the sewing machine and make a fabric tail for yourself. Don’t mistake Neoprene for Neoprin. They are different materials. Neoprin will stretch out eventually and your tail will no longer fit. 

, There are many ways to do this step, and it is up to you which method you want to use. You can make scales out of foam that you punch circles out of. It is best to use the adhesive foam that you use to make art projects with. Used a filed pipe and a hammer to punch out a lot of the scale shapes then lay them in the shape of your scale mold. The other method would be one sculpt out the scales, using clay and a cookie cutter or foil folded into the shape you want.

, The scale sheet should be completed in a box that you can then pour white hydro cal into. Be sure to build “walls” around the scales. You can see from the example above that we use 2x4 planks and then fill in the edges with clay.

, You're only sculpting half of this tail before making two pulls of it. Pulls are what you “pull” out of the mold. Don’t make it too thick, since Latex takes forever to dry, and won’t hold up well with a thick mold.


Note: Sculpt the fluke very close to the monofins size.

, Use a brush to paint the Latex into the mold. The unfortunate thing about liquid latex is that it has to air dry. This means that if you paint it too thick, it will never cure. To get a color base on the liquid Latex, add acrylic into it. This makes it so that when your tail gets scratched, there won’t be a giant white mark on it. You’re going to have to paint over the tail anyways, but this will ensure that you have something to base the color on.

Gather your materials.,
Consider offsetting your colors.,
Cut the fabric for your cape.,
Attach your cape.,
Try the costume on.,
Add accessories worthy of a princess.",How to Make a Princess Costume2," For this costume, you'll need to find a white or light blue singlet. This will form the base of your costume, and is a great option for young kids. The stretchy fabric of the singlet will allow children to move more freely, even while in costume. It's likely all of your materials can be purchased from a craft store, so be sure to bring your supply list:


Light blue or white singlet
Light blue or white skirt
Safety pins
Light blue or white see-through fabric
Plastic tiara (optional)
Fabric pens (optional)

, The snow and ice theme that Elsa uses in her costume can be imitated by using both blue and white in your costume.You may want a blue singlet and a white skirt, or the other way around.

, In the movie Frozen, Elsa has a beautiful see-through cape that trails behind her wherever she goes.You can give this effect to your costume by cutting a length of your see-through fabric slightly narrower than waist width if you are attaching it to the waist, and flare it slightly toward the bottom.


A waist-cape is recommended for young children to prevent any accidents or choking while at play, but older children may want a full cape. You can do this by cutting your fabric a little narrower than shoulder width and flaring it toward the bottom.

, You may have to make some adjustments when you put the costume on for the first time, but your cape can be easily made by attaching your fabric with safety pins. Along the back half of the waist of your skirt, pin your see-through fabric.


For a full length cape, use your safety pins to attach your fabric along the back half of the neckline. You may want to use very small safety pins, which will hide more easily in the folds of your cape.

, Start with the singlet and then add the skirt to it. Make sure you have smoothly tucked the singlet into the skirt so that the top is smooth and regal. Check your cape for balance and length, too. You may need to shorten the length or fluff it along the neck or waist to give it more lift.

, But before you add a tiara to the costume, you might want to do a simple, yet cute, hairstyle. You might even want to take the singlet off and add some princess themed designs with fabric pens.


Your Elsa princes costume might benefit from some snowflakes drawn on it, or maybe a few snowmen.

Cut your lace into strips for homemade lace wings.,
Make a fairy wand.,
Check your costume on its wearer.,
Add finishing touches.",How to Make a Princess Costume3," A fairy princess is a regal, natural creature, so you may want to include flower themed accents to your costume, like a floral necklace or flowery bracelets. These accents, along with the following list of necessaries, can be bought at your local craft store. For this costume you'll need:


Fabric tape
Lace (or other gauzy, light fabric)
Pipe cleaners
Safety pins
Scissors
T-shirt
Tiara (optional)
Tutu
Wings, Take your lace and cut it into thin strips. Then you should stretch it across the front of your shirt to give a gauzy, frilled look to it. Attach your lace by safety pinning it along the sides of the back of the shirt, but you shouldn't have to worry about stretching the lace all the way around the back. The wings of your costume should block the back of the costume from view., Lay out your shirt and position on top. This will allow you to get a better image of how the wings will look. Once you have found a satisfactory position for your wings, you'll need to use your fabric tape to attach these if there are no straps.Simply tape your wings to the singlet at the narrow part at the center of the back of your costume. You may want to use your tape in an X pattern to attach your wings with greater stability.


Use fabric tape that matches the color of your shirt to make it less visible on the costume.
Depending on the construction of your wings, fabric tape might not be an option. If your wings don't hold, you may need to sew your wings to the shirt.
If you have difficulty finding pre-made wings, you can form lacey or gauzy fabric in the shape of wings and hold it in place with fabric tape.
You might use a short length of lace to fashion cute, tiny wings, or long flowing loops of lace to make majestic ones.
If you choose to create your wings with lace, any lace or gauzy fabric will do, but a stiffer fabric will be easier to style and tape to your singlet.

, Cut your lace into two long strips. Lay your singlet on a flat, uncluttered space, and cross the strips of lace in an X shape. Leave extra lace for the top halves of your cut lace, and loop the ends of these back to the middle of the back where the strips of lace cross.


Use your tape to adhere lace and loop ends, creating two wing-like loops at the top, and trailing bottom lace that imitates the bottom portion of a fairy wing.

, You can use a single pipe cleaner for the handle of your fairy wand, or you could twist a few together to give the handle of the want a little more weight and substance. Take another pipe cleaner and bend it into the shape of a star so that both ends meet at the bottom concave part between the two bottom points. Then twist the ends of your star to the top portion of your wand handle to complete the wand.Your costume might look great with a wand made from pipe cleaner that matches the color of your costume, or you may want to give this feature pop by choosing a contrast color instead.

, Check the height and stability of your wings. If the person wearing the costume is younger, you'll want the wings firmly attached so as not to be knocked off during play. Height is also an important factor; low wings might hide behind the back of the person wearing your costume. Take stock of your frills and make any adjustments you deem necessary.

, You may want to use some body glitter to give the wearer of this costume look truly enchanting. You should try on any floral bracelets or necklaces you have that match or accent the color of your top and tutu. You should also check the look of your tiara - you may want some glitter there, too!

Measure around the head and add 2 inches (5.08 centimeters).,
Make your template.,
Trace your template onto a sheet of poster paper.,
Cut the crown out.,
Paint the crown, if desired, and let the paint dry before moving on.,
Decorate the crown and let it dry.,
Overlap the ends by 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) and secure them.,
Wear the crown carefully.",How to Make a Princess Crown1," You are adding the extra inches/centimeters so that you can overlap the ends of the crown and close it.;
, Find a large sheet of paper and cut it down to fit your measurement. Draw a horizontal line across the paper, 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) from the bottom. This is the band part. Draw your crown shape right above the band. It can be anything you want, such as a large zigzag, waves, or even a triangle in the center. When you are done, cut the template out.


To make your design symmetrical, fold the paper in half, vertically. Draw your design, with the center of your design touching the fold, and then cut it out.

, The paper can be any color you want. You can even use gold or silver poster paper. Try to use a pencil to do the tracing; that way, you can erase any marks later on. If you paper is colored on one side, the trace the design onto the back of the paper.


If you can't find any poster paper, you can use cardstock, provided that it is long enough. You can also use craft foam.

, If you used a pencil to do the tracing, carefully erase any marks.


Consider saving the template so that you can use it later on to make more princess crowns.

, You can paint it all one color, or you can paint designs onto it. If you want to make a traditional princess crown, then consider using silver or gold paint.


You can use acrylic paint and paintbrushes to paint the crown all one color. You can also use it to paint pretty designs onto it.
You can use spray paint to paint your crown all one color. Do this outside or in a well-ventilated area. Be sure to protect your work surface with lots of newspaper.

, You can decorate your crown however you want, using glue, sequins, rhinestones, glitter, and so forth. Once you finish decorating your crown, set it in a safe place and let it dry completely. Here are some decorating ideas to get you started:


Outline the crown using glitter. You can draw the designs first using white school glue, and then shake glitter onto the glue. You can also use glitter glue.
Use tacky glue or hot glue to stick on pretty beads, gems, pearls, sequins, or rhinestones.
Draw designs onto the crown using markers.
Add a feather boa. Draw a line of glue along the bottom of your crown. Start at the left edge, and stop 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) away from the right edge. Press a thin, feather (Marabou) boa into the glue and trim off the excess. You are leaving 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) uncovered so that you can glue your crown shut.

, You can use hot glue, glue dots, tacky glue, or even a stapler. If you are using tacky glue, you might want to pinch the ends shut with a paper clip or a binder clip until the glue dries.

, Even though your crown is made out of poster paper, it is still fragile. It can tear easily if you are not gentle with it. When you are done playing with your crown, keep it on a shelf so that it does not get bent.

Make a skirt.,
Get a few pieces of light stretchy fabric.,
Cut the fabric into squares that are about 3 feet (0.9 m) by 3 feet (0.9 m).,
Pin the fabric to a cloth.,
Twist the fabric a few more times until it appears to have shrunk.

,
Run an iron over the fabric.

,
Pick up the fabric and shake it out.,
Repeat this process until you have at least six pieces of the ironed stretchy fabric.

,
Attach the stretchy fabric to your skirt.,
Draw scales on the skirt.,
Give the skirt time to dry.",How to Make a Mermaid Costume1," Gather 6 yards (5.5 m) of green organza. The skirt you make should fit neatly around your waist and fall to your feet. Cut the green fabric into a rectangle based on your measurements.
Use hot glue to connect the ends of the fabric to create a tube skirt.
The seam will be the back of the costume.
If you have more time, you can sew the fabric together using thread of the same green color.;
, These will be used as fins. The fabric can be light blue, dark blue, shimmery, or metallic. You can use just one color of fabric or multiple colors.

, Pinch one of the tops of the squares, and twist the fabric.

, The cloth should be flat on a table.

,,, Shake it gently, as if you were shaking out a handkerchief.

,, Put hot glue around different points around the middle of the skirt, and attach the pieces of stretchy fabric. They should attach at a point and will fan out and cascade down the skirt.


They should start cascading just below your knees. They can fall from the same height, or from different heights for variety.

, Use a gold fabric paint to draw scales all over the skirt. Each scale can be about two or three inches long and should look like a ""C"" turned on its side.

, Wait for the fabric paint and fins to dry before you try out your new look.

Get a thin, plastic or metal headband and measure it across it.,
Place the string or measuring tape on a sheet of parchment paper and mark off where the headband begins and ends.,
Draw your design on the parchment paper.,
Use a hot glue gun to trace your design.,
Fill your design in.,
Let the glue harden, then peel it off the parchment paper.,
Decorate the crown and let it dry.,
Consider wrapping the headband with some ribbon.,
Hot glue the crown to the headband.,
Wear the crown.",How to Make a Princess Crown2," Place a measuring tape or a piece of string over the top of the headband. Measure it from end to end. This will be your guideline for your crown.

, Your crown design must fit between the two lines you made. If the design extends past those lines, your crown will be too big.

, Be sure to include a thin line along the base, so that your crown will stick together. Try not to make the crown too tall, or the hot glue will flop over even after it set.

, You can use regular clear hot glue, or you can use glitter hot glue. Go over the design two to three times to make it thick and sturdy.


Be sure to draw a line across the bottom of your design. This will help hold your crown together. You will also be using this to attach the crown to the headband.

, You can fill it in with solid glue, or with squiggles, loops, and swirls. Whatever design you choose, make sure that it touches the outline of your crown, or it won't hold together.

, Most hot glue sets pretty quickly, depending on how cold it is in the room. Some glues will turn opaque once they harden, while others will remain clear.

, Place the crown back on the parchment paper and decorate it. You can paint it, cover it with glitter, or even glue some rhinestones on. To go with the ice theme, chose colors such as blue, turquoise, white, and silver. Here are some decorating ideas:


To give your crown a translucent color, use colored permanent markers to color it in. Avoid using paint pens, as those are not translucent.
To give your crown a solid color, use acrylic paints and a paintbrush. You can use regular acrylic paint, metallic acrylic paint, or even glitter paint.
Give your crown some sparkle with glitter. Paint your crown with Mod Podge or white glue, then shake some glitter onto it. Tap the excess glitter off. The best glitter for an ice crown would be super fine iridescent glitter.
Glue tiny rhinestones or pearls along the base of the crown. You can use hot glue or superglue.
Decorate the crown with rhinestones or tiny snowflake confetti/sequins. You can put a large rhinestone in the center, and use smaller ones towards the edges. You can also put some rhinestones on the points. Use hot glue or superglue for this.

, This will give the hot glue something to grip on to. Place a drop of hot glue on one end of the headband, and press the end of a ribbon into it. Wrap the ribbon around the headband, like a candy cane, overlapping the edges by a little. When you get to the other side, trim off the excess ribbon, and secure the end with more hot glue.


Choose a ribbon that is ¼ to ½ inch (0.64 to 1/27 centimeters) thick.
Try to choose a color that matches your crown.

, Flip your crown over so that the back is facing you. Draw a thin line of glue along the bottom of the crown. Press the crown to the top of the headband. Make sure that the crown is centered. When you lay the headband flat on the table, the crown should be sticking straight up.

, Even though you made the crown on a headband, you won't be wearing it like a headband. Instead, put the crown on top of your head, like a halo or tiara.

Find some lace trim.,
Cut the lace trim 8 to 12 inches (20.32 to 30.48 centimeters) long.,
Consider painting the lace.If your crown is not the right color, you can always paint it using acrylic paint or spray paint.,
Cover the crown with Mod Podge or fabric stiffener.This will help your crown keep its shape.,
Decorate the lace.,
Fold the crown into a circle and secure the ends with glue.,
Consider gluing the crown onto a headband or a hair comb.",How to Make a Princess Crown3," Try to get the embroidered or crocheted kind with the scalloped or zigzag edge. The fancy edge will become the fancy points of your crown. Avoid getting thin, fabric lace or ruffled lace; those are not stable enough to make princess crowns.


Don't worry if the lace is not the right color. Choose the lace for the shape. You can always paint it.

, Because lace trim is so short, it usually shorts better as a mini crown. You can try making it as a regular crown; to do this, cut the lace a little bit longer than the circumference of your head.

, Place the crown down onto a sheet of paper, then paint it. Once the paint dries, flip the crown over, and paint the other side. Most acrylic paints and spray paints will be dry to the touch in 20 minutes, but some may require up to two hours. Refer to the label for more specific drying times.


If you are using acrylic paint, dab it on using paint brushes or foam brushes. Be sure to get the paint into all of the nooks and crannies.
If you are using spray paint, be sure to paint outside or in a well-ventilated area.

, Cover one side with Mod Podge or fabric stiffener and wait for it to dry. Then, flip the crown over, and cover the other side. Allow the Mod Podge or fabric stiffener to dry completely before moving on.

, You can decorate the lace crown however you want, but you might want to keep the lace's original pattern/design as a guideline. Here are some decorating ideas:


Outline the crown with glitter. You can draw on the crown using white school glue, and then shake glitter over the glue. You can also use glitter glue instead.
Attach rhinestones to the crown using hot glue or fabric glue.
Glue a line of tiny rhinestones or pearls all along the bottom edge of the crown.

, Overlap the ends by at least ½ inch (1.27 centimeters), or until the first point on either side are aligned. Secure them with a line of glue. You can use hot glue or fabric glue to do this. If you are using fabric glue, you might want to secure the ends with some clothespins until the glue dries.

, If you made a little crown, you likely won't be able to fit it over your head. You can still wear this dainty crown if you attach it to a headband or a hair comb. Start by placing two drops of glue onto your headband or hair clip; the drops of glue need to be the same width as the crown. Press the bottom edges of the crown into the glue; try to keep its round shape as you do so.


You can also loosely stitch the crown to the headband or hair comb once the glue dries. This will make it even more stable.

Choose two to four different ribbons.,
Slip knot the curly ribbon at the back of the wire crown.,
Finished.

",How to Make a Princess Crown4," You are adding the extra length so that you can close the crown later on.

, Try to find a stiffer wire that holds its shape when you form a circle with it. This will create a nice, sturdy base for your crown.

, Overlap the ends by 1 inch (2.54). Twist them close, or wrap florists tape around the seam. If the wire is very stiff, gently bend it into a slight oval shape so that it can fit the wearer's head better. This will be the base of your crown.

, Start at the seam, and start wrapping the tape around the wire, like a candy cane. Be sure to overlap the tape a little bit. This will make your crown sturdier. It will also make it easier to attach your flowers to the crown later on.

, Leave a 1 to 2 inch (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) long stem at the end of each flower. You will be using this to attach the flower to your crown. It would be a good idea to use wire cutters when snipping the stems; most silk flowers have wires inside the stems.


Consider saving some of the leaves as well. They can make great filler.

, You can add as many or as few flowers as you like. Your entire crown can be covered, or just the top part. Here are some more ideas to get you started:


Arrange the largest flowers in the middle, and use smaller flowers towards the end.
Alternate between large flowers, such as roses, and smaller flowers, such as baby's breath.
Use either warm or cool colors for a unified look. For example, if you want a fall or summer fairy princess, you can try red/pink, orange, and yellow. If you want a winter or ice fairy princess, try green/turquoise, blue, and purple.
Use contrasting colors, such as white, yellow, and sky blue.

, Pick up your first flower, and hold it against the crown. The stem should be parallel to the wire. Wrap green florists tape around the flower and wire. Be sure to extend the tape ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) past the end of the stem.

, To create a very full crown, position the flower right over the first flower's stem. To create a thinner, more delicate crown, position the flower just behind the first flower's stem. Wrap florists tape over the stem and wire. Be sure to extend the tape ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) past the end of the stem.

,

, Try using both sheer and solid ribbons for more texture. Cut your ribbons twice as long as you want them to be; you will be folding them in half later on. Generally, about shoulder-length works well.


Consider using varying lengths for a more organic effect.
Smaller princesses may need shorter ribbons so that they won't get caught on anything.

, Gather all of your ribbons together. Fold them in half, all at the same time. Take the folded part (the loop) and place it against the back of your crown, right where the seam is. Take the loose ends of the ribbon, and pull them through the loop. Gently tug down on the loose ends to tighten the loop. You should now have twice as many ribbons trailing down the back of your crown. For example, if you used four ribbons, you'll end up with eight ribbon strands.,"

Let the wings dry.",How to Make Angel Wings1," The main base of your wings will be composed of paper plates. You'll need a pack of plates or around 20 plates. It's a good idea to have a couple extra plates around in case you make a mistake. You can use whatever color you want. You can also use plastic plates. You'll additionally need:


A marker or pencil
Scissors
Ribbon
Glue (Hot glue gun or crafting glue);
, Starting at the center top edge of your first paper plate, draw a curved line down to the center bottom edge. The separated section should look like a crescent moon and should mostly be the ridged part of the plate. Repeat this drawing on 15 other plates., The second crescent moon shape should be the exact mirror of the first. The second crescent moon should have the same beginning and end points. A football or eye shape should remain in between the two separated sections.

, Cut out the crescent moon shapes and set them aside. These will be the feathers for you wings. The center section can be discarded.

, Line eight of the paper plate feathers along one side of a whole paper plate. You can judge where the feathers should be by looking, but they should be placed close together. The edge of the feathers should all be facing downwards. Look at the whole plate and imagine that it were a clock face with numbers. Starting from the left side, your first feather should be positioned around the 10 or 11 o'clock mark.


The plate should be facing up, or the position you’d normally eat from.
It helps to position everything before you begin gluing.
The angle of the top feather should be aimed outward. The feathers that follow should gradually begin pointing down and in.
The lowest feather should end around the 8 o'clock mark.

, Complete the exact process with the remaining feathers. Starting on the right side, the top feather should be around 1 or 2 o'clock mark.The last feather should end around the 4 o'clock mark.


Again, the angle of the top feather should be aimed slightly outward. The feathers that follow should gradually begin pointing down and in.

, Once you feel satisfied with how the paper plate feathers look, you can glue them into place. It might be helpful to make small marks with a pen or pencil so that you can remember where the feathers start and end. Apply a dot of glue from a hot glue gun to the tip of each feather where it will be attached to the base. Press each feather to the inside of the whole paper plate.


Make all visible glue marks on the inside of the plate.

, Apply a thin line of glue in the center of the paper plate. The glue should be applied to the inside where the attached feather tips are exposed. Press a second plate over the first to secure the feathers.

, Each piece should be around 23 inches (58 cm), or however long they need to be to slip comfortably over the wearer's arms and shoulders. Use a gold ribbon or an ornate ribbon to add to the presentation.

, The top of the ribbon should begin around the same area the feathers begin at. The bottom of the ribbons should end around the same area the feathers end. Apply a small dot of glue on both ends to adhere the ribbons to the plate.

, To cover the edges of the arm straps and for added security, fix a third plate over the second. Glue around the edges of the second plate and secure the third and final plate over it.

, Once the glue has finished drying and cooling, the wings will be ready to wear. Wait between 20 to 30 minutes for the glue to dry.

"
Come up with a compelling premise, or ""what if?"",
Choose the genre and format for your show.,
Develop your characters.,
Write up a treatment for the show.,
Build some content around your idea.",How to Make Your Own TV Show1," idea. Your idea could be as simple as ""what if a documentary crew filmed a small paper company"" (The Office) to a big, complex idea like ""what if a chemistry teacher started cooking meth?"" (Breaking Bad). This is the backbone of your show, what will set it apart, and what will help it sell.


A lot of ""what ifs"" are generated by mixing and matching existing shows. 30 Rock, for example, is the world of SNL mixed into the workplace humor of The Office or Cheers. Famed drama The Wire is a mix between crime shows and political thrillers.
Think of shows you admire and might emulate-- what are their simple, one phrase ""what if"" ideas?;
, This is one of the most important decisions you'll make, as it affects everything that comes afterward. The genre is the mood and tone of the show -- is it a comedy, medical drama, or reality TV show? The format is the timing of the show, and there are a few options:



Episodic: Each episode is a self-contained story. Comedies are usually episodic, half-hour shows, but some crime shows and murder mysteries are also episodic.

Serial: Each episode builds on the story of the one before it. These shows generally tell season-long stories, like Breaking Bad,'The West Wing, or ""Gravity Falls."" They are almost always hour-long shows and are usually dramatic.


Sketch: Sketch shows are made up of many smaller, self-contained stories. This is like Saturday Night Live, Key & Peele, or MadTV.


, List each character and give them a 2-3 sentence description. Avoid physical descriptions, instead trying to capture what makes each character unique:Good characters have flaws and strengths. They are round -- meaning that they have a personality beyond ""the angry gardener"" or ""the loving mother.""
What does each character want? What is the character afraid of? This drives each character's actions in the show.
Reality shows still need to describe the characters. What makes your subjects interesting or compelling? Why would an audience want to hear their story?, Treatments are somewhat like the blueprint for a show. They are used to show a development executive exactly what to expect from the show, should they make it themselves. To develop a treatment, you need a few things:



The Title: A good title usually has two meanings. Look at Mad Men, for example, which promises the world of advertising agencies as well as the slipping sanity of Don Draper.

The Logline: This is a punchy, 1-2 sentence recap of the show. It's the hook, based around the ""what if"" premise. For example, Community's logline might be, ""A hotshot lawyer is forced to make a crazy new group of friends when his fake law degree forces him back to community college.""

The Synopsis: This is a brief, 1 page write up of the show idea. What is the setting, plot, and general focus of each episode? How can you capture the essence of the show in 3-4 sentences? If this is a serial show, outline the progression of the first season.Character Sheets: Take each main character and write 1-2 sentences about them, focusing on their personalities and goals more than their looks.

Episode Guide: Write a short paragraph about the first 4-5 episodes you want to show, detailing the plots that will make up the bulk of your show., The best way to sell your show is to show someone the show in progress. Thanks to all of the cheap equipment these days, it is easier than ever to get pieces of your show on the web and in people's hands. The type of material you develop, however, will depend on your show.



Scripts: It never hurts to have a script, and this is the most conventional and successful approach to making your own show, especially hour-long shows and dramas.

Webisodes: The best way to get attention is to simply make your show yourself. Youtube has made it remarkably easy to shoot short 2-5-minute episodes involving your characters and share them with the world. This is how Broad City and Workaholics both got picked up.

Storyboards and Sizzle Reels: Like a webisode but for longer projects, these are like test shots for your show. It could be an interview for a talk show, test shots for a reality TV episode, or storyboards and drawings for an animated show.

Gather your supplies.,
Draw wing shapes on cardboard.,
Cut out the wings.Cut along the outline you made with scissors.,
Punch holes into the cardboard for arm bands.,
Thread ribbon through the holes.,
Fold coffee filters in half.,
Attach the filters.,
Cover the outer edge of the wings.,
Layer coffee filters over both sides of the wings.,
Wait for the glue to dry.",How to Make Angel Wings2," The base of your wings will consist of coffee filters and cardboard. Use cheap coffee filters or whatever you have in your home. No need to buy specialty coffee filters for your angel wings. Purchase a full package of coffee filters in case you need additional filters. You'll also need:


Scrap cardboard
Pen or pencil
Scissors
Crafting glue
Ribbon or shoelaces

, The cardboard can be any size you want, but a good size to consider will span the distance between the wearer's chin and lower back. Look at pictures online for inspiration and draw your outline on the cardboard. Make both wings as symmetrical as possible.

, The cut should be straight and run cleanly from the center dip to the bottom point. This will form the frame of your wings. Spend time creating clean cuts.


Ultimately you will cover the edges of the cardboard with coffee filters. Don’t restart if you cut an extra line in the cardboard or make a minor mistake.

, You may need to experiment with where the holes should be by holding the wings up to the back of the wearer. One hole should go roughly 2 inches (5 cm) below the top point of one wing. The second should extend down about 4 inches (10 cm) from the first hole created. The other two holes for the second wing should be in the same place.

, You will need four ribbons, but it’s also doable using two. The first ribbon will create an arm strap, securing the ribbon to both holes of one wing. The second ribbon should connect both holes on the other wing and create a second arm strap. Tie the ribbons in place to ensure that there is enough room for the wearer's arm to go through.


Two ribbons will secure the wings to your back. The third and fourth ribbons are used to secure the wings together.
The third ribbon will connect the top holes of both wings and the final ribbon should connect the bottom holes of both wings. The last two ribbons will be considerably shorter than the arm straps.
Tie the ribbons in place to make sure that the wings can be slipped over the wearer's shoulders.
Make sure the cardboard can be seen from the wearer's front.

, The number of coffee filters you need will vary depending on the size of your wings You will need enough to cover the entire front and back with folded filters.


Arrange the folded filters onto the cardboard and play with the design until you find a good fit.
Experiment by folding multiple coffee into one fold.

, Glue a line of coffee filters along the inside of each wing.Glue the coffee filters to the front and back of the cardboard. This will make the rounded edges hang over the cardboard on both sides.

, Starting at the bottom inside corner, slide a coffee filter over the edge of cardboard. Position it in a way that one half covers the front and the other half covers the back. Continue lining the coffee filters along the outer edge of the wing in this manner, overlapping them slightly, until you reach the top inside corner.

, Each layer should slightly overlap the layer before it. The entire front and back should be covered with halved filters, but do not worry if you can see a little cardboard at the outer edge of the wings.

, Wait about thirty minutes for the glue to dry. Try the wings on once the glue dries. As soon as the glue dries, the wings are ready to wear.

Gather your supplies.,
Connect the knitting needles.,
Wrap the frame in wire.,
Cut out cardboard pieces.,
Attach the cardboard.,
Cover the frame.,
Attach feathers.,
Attach a ribbon.,
Let the wings dry.",How to Make Angel Wings3," Scout thrift stores for used knitting needles. You'll need four to create the frame of the wings. This method will require you to go to a craft supplies store to purchase a bag of feathers and crafting wire (15-20 gauge). You'll also need the following:


Spare white t-shirts
Hot glue gun
Ribbon
Spare cardboard
Scissors
Craft glue

, You’ll need to connect two knitting needles together to make one wing’s frame. Use a hot glue gun to connect two needles a little wider than 90 degrees. Do this same process to the other pair of knitting needles to create two wings.


Allow the glue to dry and settle for about ten minutes before continuing.
Make sure the frames are symmetrical before continuing.

, Use two strands of wire to wrap around the frame. As you wrap the wire, create small loops on the frame.The loops only need to be about an inch. The wire and loops will be used to attach the cardboard frame. You should use the hot glue gun to attach the wire to the frame.


If you’re experiencing difficulties attaching the initial wire, begin gluing the wire as you wrap it. The glue and wires will eventually be covered up.
There should be roughly eight loops per each needle. This will make about sixteen loops for each wing.

, Cut out four triangles for each wing. The triangles don’t need to be the same size. It’s okay if there are spaces between the needles and the cardboard. The gaps will be covered by the t-shirt and feathers. Try to make your triangles obtuse and isosceles to add to the shape of the wings.


Be sure that the four triangles you use for one wing match the four triangles for the other wing.

, Lie out the cardboard triangles into a design you like before attaching to the wire. Use spare wire to connect the cardboard triangles to both each other and the knitting needles. They need to be attached, but it’s okay if they dangle a bit.


Eagle wings are good to base your design on. Look in particular at the eagle wings in the extended-folded position.
Another design you can use is to look up angle wings online to see all the variations of angle wings.
The cardboard pieces do not have to look perfect or even. They will ultimately be covered up!

, Use an old, spare t-shirts to create a cover for your frame. Cut off the sleeves of the t-shirt and fit one to each wing. Use the hot glue gun to make sure that your shirt highlights the frame's design.You may need to cut up your t-shirt to create a fitted look.

, Use either a hot glue gun or a strong glue stick to attach the feathers to the t-shirt. The key to attaching the feathers is to make sure the feathers are facing outwards. The feathers should also point in the same direction for a clean look.

, To wear the wings, you need to attach ribbons that fit the wearer’s arms and shoulders. Cut a strip of ribbon, about 20 inches. Test the size before attaching to a wing. Once you’ve found a proper fit, use a hot glue gun to attach the ribbons creating an arm strap.


Attach the wings near the top of the wings, close to the wearer's shoulder blades.
Repeat the exact process for the opposite wing.
You can use a small strand of ribbon to connect the two ribbons together. This will secure the wings to your back and bring them look close together., Once the glue has finished drying and cooling, the wings will be ready to wear. Wait about 20 to 30 minutes for the glue to dry.

Understand basic screenwriting formatting and conventions.,
Read as many screenplays in your genre as you can.,
Understand the needs of a good pilot.,
Outline your plot using TV act structure.,
Do a table read after your first draft.,
Write, write, and rewrite.,
Shorten your script as much as possible.",How to Make Your Own TV Show2," Screenplays are specially formatted so that each page takes up roughly one minute of screen time. This format is the industry standard, and deviating from it will often end with your screenplay in the trash. The best way to avoid this is to use script software, such as Celtx, Writer Duets, or Final Draft.Television scripts are formatted differently than movies, because you need to make act breaks, or where the commercials would go. Make sure you're reading and studying TV scripts to learn these conventions.
There are many examples of formatted scripts online, such as this lesson written in the form of a screenplay.


, Go online and check out scripts from every show similar to yours. Watching TV is a great way to understand plotting, but if you're going to write scripts you need to understand the art of the script. Take notes as you read about style, plotting, and substance.


Reading screenplays is a must in this business. You need to learn how to be funny, dramatic, thrilling, and engaging without any actors, cameras, or music to help you.
Make notes of what that works, what doesn't, and how the writer builds the world of the episode on the page., A pilot is the first episode of a TV series, and they are notoriously difficult to write well. Why? Because pilots require you do many things at once with a short page count. You must:



Introduce the characters: You don't need to go into the entire backstory, but the viewer needs to know enough about these characters to want to follow them. The very first time you see a character should show their basic personality.

Introduce the world: This is about more than just the setting, it is the ""rules"" of the show. What are some of the main concerns for the characters? What kind of events happen regularly? This is the exploration of your ""what if"" premise.

Show the general pattern of the show: Your pilot episode doesn't just have to introduce everything, it has to be a good show. You need to give people an idea of what they'll see each week. Arrested Development, considered one of the best pilots ever, does this perfectly -- it sets up the characters, shows the world (rich, corrupt socialites and hedge-fund managers), and shows the farcical, interlocking plot structure the show later became famous for., TV shows, despite their originality and diversity, have a pretty rigid structure. Because most TV comes with commercials, these little breaks are convenient places to end each Act. Think of an act as a collection of scenes that tells the mini story of an episode. Between each set of commercials, you have the progression of the story, ending in a big moment, change, or climax that excites the viewer to keep watching when the commercials end. Understanding this ""grid"" helps you plug your show into the formula:The Cold Open: Common on sitcoms, this is the brief, 2-3 minute scene right before the title credits. It can impact the plot or just be a quick joke or scene. In dramas it is often the instigating incident, like finding the dead body on Law & Order.


The Acts: Hour-long shows have 5 acts, and half-hour shows have 3. You want each act to be somewhat self-contained: it has a beginning problem, a series of complications that prevent the characters from solving the problem, a climax, and a resolution.

Act 1 introduces a problem, and the characters try and fix it but fail.
In Act 2, the characters are in an even bigger mess, thanks to their failure, they make another attempt and things end up worse than before, or a new problem arises thanks to the old one.
In Act 3 everything returns to normal, either by the characters crashing back down to earth or finally fixing the mess they got into.



The Ending: Your last act brings the audience back around. For a pilot, you need to prove to the audience that they should come back next week.

In dramas this usually occurs with a cliffhanger, or the promise of next week's adventure.
In comedies the episode almost always ends where it started. Your characters don't change much and are ready for next week's hijinks. The status quo is returned.



The Tag: This is the small scene right before or after the credits. Usually, it is to continue a joke, show a little resolution, or hint at what happens next episode., Get some friends together and hand out copies of your script, then have them read out each part as if they were actors. You can narrate, but try not to play any of the characters. Instead, take notes on what sounds natural and what doesn't. Ask you guests afterward what they thought about the script: where were they confused, what did they enjoy, did their characters feel ""real,"" and would they watch the show? You need to get outside input, and hearing your script out loud is the best way to find mistakes you might have missed while reading.

, Take a few days away from the script and approach it again with fresh eyes. You need your script to be as polished as it can be in order to make an impression because there are thousands of scripts competing for attention. Some things to look out for include:


Spelling, grammar, and formatting. A typo on the first page is a good clue for someone to throw the whole thing away without reading.
Pacing. Every single scene should move the plot forward. If it is not, the show automatically starts to drag. No scene should start in one place and stay there the entire time. Your characters or situation need to change each time, otherwise the scene is too slow.
Dialog. Do you characters sound natural? You need to put the image of a character in your readers' mind with just dialog, so each character needs to talk in a unique, natural way, not just the way you need them to talk in the scene. Character is important, and you show character through speech., Cut away unnecessary exposition, scene descriptions, and character traits. If it doesn't matter to the plot, it needs to go. All the other stuff, from an actor's looks to the color of the walls, will be decided by the director, not you. You want the script to read like a show, moving briskly along and sweeping up the reader in the story and characters. Shorter is always better because it means you cut away anything that wasn't amazing or essential.


Hour long shows need to be between 45-70 pages.
Half-hour programs are usually between 25-37 pages."
"
Consider shooting the show yourself.,
Tap into industry representatives and resources.,
Create a list of companies to approach that make shows like yours.,
Keep on writing, filming, and working in the film/TV industry.",How to Make Your Own TV Show3," If you've never had a Hollywood job before, the best way to get attention is to demand it. Getting someone to read your script is tough, but if you can develop a few thousand views on your video people will start to take notice. You don't necessarily need to shoot the entire show, either. Sites like Amazon Studios, for example, allow you to post clips that people vote up and down, giving great ideas visibility.



Always Sunny in Philadelphia, for example, was written and shot on a tiny budget, then sent to executives at FX. They were so impressed with what they saw they bought the show.
Almost anyone can get a show on Public Access, and they often have equipment and training options available too., Shop for agents and producers who are open for submissions, and enter in contests and festivals for exposure. The best way to do this is through ""the trades,"" such as Deadline.com or Variety. These sites are mandatory reads, as they talk about development deals, who is shopping for shows, and agents currently on the market.


Whenever you see a show like yours or a writer/producer you admire finding work, make a note of their agency (like CAA or WME) and their collaborators. Check out their websites and send out query letters asking to meet.You can also post your idea on search sites, like The Blacklist, that allow agents to search for manuscripts that match their interests. They cost money, however, and you should always research ""success stories"" by checking out the projects online to see if the show actually got made.

, Find the groups that are making shows like yours and send them a quick letter. Use their websites to get the names and emails of executives and workers in the ""Development"" department. The more you can tailor your search to specific people that would be interested in your script the better your odds of making a show.


You wouldn't pitch a cheesy monster show to NBC, you'd send it to SyFy. Reality TV shows shouldn't be sent to the producers of The Sopranos. Think about what the studio is already making to pitch to the right people., Very few people make a TV show without starting on the bottom rung. You can always produce your own show, and you might take off. But 95% of all TV creators started as production assistants, writing assistants, camera operators, actors, etc. This is the best way to meet people who might help you out later on and opportunity and learn how TV is constructed.


You should try and have 3-5 pilots scripts on hand or being worked on at any one time. You never know when an idea will be taken, when someone will like you but want a different story, or when someone wants to see more of your work. The people who get shows made keep working, writing and rewriting until something is on air.

Get a camera.,
Find the best angles.,
Keep rolling.,
Stay as steady as possible.,
Get as close as possible if you want to capture sound.",How to Make a Video1," Depending on your reasons for making the video, you may want to invest in a high-quality camera to create a professional-looking project, or you may want to use whatever is available for a cheaper option. Whatever the case, getting a camera to shoot video on should be your first step.



Cellphone videos are super-cheap and really easy to use. They can be a little shaky, however, and the sound is usually not very good, but if you want to grab some video quickly and easily, the camera on your cell is a good option.

Digital photo cameras regularly have video features, and some are quite cheap and fairly high-quality. Cameras with SD cards are widely available and user-friendly.

HD Cameras can run anywhere between a few hundred and a few thousand dollars and will look very professional. Many low-budget Hollywood movies have been shot on basic HD cameras you can buy at electronics stores like Best Buy, or even explore renting options in your area.;
, Whether you're shooting a birthday party, concert, a wedding, or some other event, get to the place early and do some scouting to see the right angles for shooting video. Find a few comfortable positions and shoot from multiple angles to get different footage that you'll be able to edit together later into a nice product.


If you've got a helper, you can shoot simultaneously from different angles to provide cuts in your finished product with editing. This can be a cool effect that will make your finished product seem finished and professional.
Try to stay out of peoples' way, especially if there's a sizable crowd. You want to get the close shot and the right angle, but you're not the only one there. Make sure everyone can see and shoot from a reasonable distance., To be ready for spontaneous moments, keep the camera going! Pick the right time to start and let the camera warm up, so the video begins before the actual action you want to capture. If you Try to fire up the camera when you see your kid sprinting toward the goal, ready to take a shot in the championship soccer game, it's likely you'll miss it. If you've been filming since half-time, though, you'll be ready.


Don't try to edit together your video on the fly. It's better to avoid lots of stops and starts to the video, because you'll have trouble remember what shot happened when, which will be much easier to sort out if you've got longer shots. You can edit out the unnecessary bits later, but most cameras have lots of room on them, so take advantage of it.

, If you're using the camera on your cellphone, or any camera that isn't steadied with a tripod, Try to hold it as steady as possible. Shakiness and blurriness from an unsteady hand can make important video footage frustrating and unwatchable. Sit down while shooting and steady your arms on your knees, if necessary, or invest in a tripod that'll keep the camera steady on the ground.


A common mistake on iPhone cameras involves holding the phone vertically while taking video, as opposed to horizontally. When you upload the video to your computer later to edit it (if you want to) you'll have annoying bars on either side of the screen. Shoot the ""landscape"" style and hold the camera long-ways. It'll show up sideways on your phone, but you can tilt it later on your computer and it'll look right.

, If you're just using the built-in mic on your camera and not trying to capture sound with other microphones, you'll have a lot of trouble hearing the action unless you're quite close.

Determine the big moment the scene is building up towards.,
Figure out what is going to make your scene surprising or unique.,
Remember that suspense, in any scene, requires audience empathy.,
Storyboard out the scene with pictures, text, and dialogue.",How to Make a Suspenseful Scene1," The best way to create suspense is to work backward -- you know what needs to happen, so you need to build towards that moment with suspense, patience, and tension. A basic tenet of film suspense is the idea of tension and release. The audience is convinced something bad is going to happen, even if they don't know what, and the suspense comes from wanting and waiting for that release (or hoping to avoid it). Some common moments include:


A difficult or impossible challenge -- see Game of Thrones, especially battle episodes like ""Hearthorn"" and ""Battle of the Bastards,"" which put characters up against long odds and then watches them to near death.
An approaching villain or enemy. From every slasher movie ever made to the ridiculously intense No Country for Old Men, the cat-and-mouse chase scene is a classic suspense trope.
A moment the audience understands but the characters don't. Known as dramatic irony, we naturally start to squirm when we know a character is making a mistake but are powerless to stop them. The classic Romeo and Juliet, where Romeo commits suicide because he thought Juliet had died (she was only faking), is one of the best examples.;
, This doesn't have to be huge, but a little originality goes a long way towards making a scene suspenseful. If the audience can predict what is going to happen, or has seen it before, the suspense is immediately sucked out. Remember, however, that even little things matter:


Stanley Kubrick made history with completely silent scenes of suspense in 2001: A Space Odyssey (among other tricks).Hitchcock's Psycho changed movie history forever by killing the lead actress first -- not last. The death scene itself wasn't revolutionary, but he masterfully subverted audience expectations to create shock and suspense.

The Departed created suspense simply, but effectively, by showing both sides of the story. By making you see the cop's perspective and the mafia's, you understand before anyone else in the movie that everyone is royally screwed., Otherwise said, the more the viewer can place themselves in the viewers shoes, the more suspenseful the scene will be. In many ways, this is the job of the rest of the movie -- creating believable characters and scenes so that you buy into the suspense without thinking. However, there are some big tips that you must remember to prevent ripping the viewer out of the scene:Characters must make believable decisions. Everyone's seen the horror movie where the idiot ""hero"" walks out into the dark night to confront the villain and gets promptly cut down. When characters do things no real person would ever do, audiences tend to laugh.

All characters need some personality. Again, look to slashers to see what not to do. When your characters have no backstory, goals, or personality, you could care less what happens to them. The easiest way to do this is to give them a dream or goal in the scene -- something they are striving to (escape, victory, food, etc.), so they are active participants, not just your next victims.

Both success and failure must be plausible: If it is obvious the character is going to die or going to win, you lose all-important the suspense of wondering what happens next., When filming a suspenseful scene, you are rarely going to be able to shoot everything at once. Even if you do, you'll need a game plan before you get started -- a comic book-like version of the movie that lets you effectively plan each shot out. This is the time to test out all of the ideas in the steps above, ""shooting"" the scene before you even turn a camera on.


Some filmmakers like to write out the scene in paragraph form first, as this is a good way to ""tell"" the story and figure out the pacing.
You can print out free storyboard sheets online with a simple search.
The more detailed this plan is, the better you will be when it comes time to shoot."

Upload your footage onto your computer.,
Download editing software.,
Cut out unnecessary or confusing bits.,
Don't be afraid to rearrange.,
Add transitions to smoothen out the final video.,
Add sound effects or music.,
Finalize the project.,
Share the video.",How to Make a Video2," After you've shot the raw footage, upload it onto your computer and edit it. Most cameras can be connected via USB cords or by an SD card that you can remove and load into a (usually) USB converter. Follow the instructions for the particular camera that you've used.


Save the raw footage as a separate document so you can feel free to edit and make changes. You can always go back to the original footage if necessary, confident that you won't lose any of it. You can always start over.

, Unless you shot everything perfectly and want to keep your video as is, it's best to use a user-friendly editing software that will allow you to trim, adjust, add music, and otherwise clean-up the raw video that you've captured. If you want to add captions or boost the audio, you'll need to open the footage with some kind of editing software.



Popular free versions of editing software include:

iMovie
Windows Movie Maker
Avidemux



Professional editing software includes:

Apple Final Cut Pro
Corel VideoStudio Pro
Adobe Premiere Elements



, When you've loaded the footage into the software, start cutting out anything that you don't want in the final product. Cut repetitive scenes, or trim down everything to the bare essentials and start organizing your best footage. Depending on the kind of video you want to make, you may want more shaky and informal footage, or you may want a clean and professional product. Use your judgement depending on the project.

, Move scenes around to switch the order if it improves the video. If you're documenting a party or another event, don't worry so much about staying true to ""the way things really happened"" and make the best possible version of the video that you're making. Tell a story.

, Most editing software includes lots of options that allow you to smoothly transition from one scene into another scene, making it easy to move things around and make changes. Avoid hard or disjunctive cuts, unless that's an effect you hope to include in the video for some reason.


iMovie and other kinds of software has lots of complicated fades and transitions that you can use, but use them sparingly. It can distract from the final video if you get carried away. Stay true to the content and make the video the most important thing, not the fancy transition you just learned how to do on the computer.

, If it fits the video you want to make, upload music that's on your computer and use it in the background as a soundtrack to montage moments in your video, or take the sound out entirely if its not important, and use music in its place. This can be a good way to lively up camera phone video that might not have audio as good as the quality of its video.

, When you're finished, finalize the project by exporting the finished video into a video file, like a .avi or a .mov. Open in a playback software like Windows Media Player or Quicktime and check out your work.

, After you've exported the file, consider how you'd like to share your work with others. You could burn your video onto a DVD to provide physical copies to people. This is a particularly good option if you've taken wedding footage, or footage of another kind of private event that was attended by a small group of people who would be interested in the footage.


If the video has wider appeal, upload your video to YouTube. As long as it's short enough, you can create a YouTube account and upload your video relatively quickly. It'll be online in no time and then you'll be able to share the link with anyone you want.
If you want your video online, but would prefer it stay somewhat private, you can upload privately with a Vimeo account. The video will be password-protected and very high-quality, meaning that you can share it freely with anyone who you provide the password with, but it won't be visible to just anyone.

Set dramatic, moody lighting, but remember it is always easier to remove light while editing then add it.,
Make the most of both the foreground and background.,
Experiment with odd or dramatic camera angles to unsettle the audience.,
Keep the camera rolling, and the actors in motion, both before and after the scene.,
Slowly tease out your major scare of tension, saving the full reveal for last.,
Mess around with changing lenses and angles.,
Pepper in 1-2 ""false scares"" and close calls to ratchet up the tension.",How to Make a Suspenseful Scene2," This rule holds for any scene, from suspense to romance, but it is extra important here since most directors want low-lighting in order to be dramatic. While editing, you can easily darken up a scene to make it more mysterious or suspenseful, but adding light will dramatically decrease picture quality.


A good rule of thumb is to work with a wide range of lighting, using big, clear bright areas offset by dramatically dark shadows.
Putting your camera into black and white mode is often the best way to check for well-lit scenes., A good shot is like a photograph -- you could stop the movie and still see a compelling image. As such, the shots need depth, and this is doubly true in suspense filmmaking, where you can use the background to show things to the audience that the character might not notice. A woman washing dishes, followed by a shot of someone entering her house, is creepy. But a shot over the woman's shoulder as she washes, as a shadowy frame fills the doorway, is downright terrifying.


This is where storyboarding ahead of time is your best friend. How can you compose each shot to have suspense -- not just the scene as a whole.

, The most famous example of this is in Kubrick's The Shining, where he breaks the essential ""180-rule"" that claims that cameras shouldn't be on opposite sides of the room. Without knowing this rule, viewers were completely unsettled because it was unlike anything they'd ever seen. These subtle details separate the masters from the amateurs. Other ideas include:



Voyeuristic shots, where the camera acts like a predator hunting prey. As an audience member, you understand someone is watching your hero without every showing the villain. Frequently, filtering the shot through tree leaves, blinds, etc. can help.

Unnaturally low or high shots, as well as extreme close-ups, don't feel like real life. They jar the viewer and keep them on edge.

Hand-held camera work with shakes and unsteadiness, give a chaotic, uncomfortable feel, especially in moments of tension., Suspense requires silence, stillness, and moments of quiet, which build feelings of dread until the big moment happens. Don't just film the ""action"" of the scene -- make sure you get plenty of slower, creepier, and more atmospheric footage as well. You editor will thank you.


Long shots naturally put viewers on edge, as we're used to relatively short cuts between each shot. The longer you hold the frame, the more people feel like there is something they are missing or is about to happen, building the coveted suspense.

, No one is suspenseful after they know what happens -- you're only feeling nervous when waiting to see what is coming. Once you show your cards, you've moved away from suspense and into action -- an essential part of the movie or scene, but not just yet. The best suspense gives you little pieces and clues, knowing that the creature in the audience's imagination is far more terrifying than any you can show on screen., Another classic Hitchcock technique, the transition between a super shallow shot to a big wide-angle lens will keep interest and force the audience to suddenly scan the screen -- why the change? Am I missing something dangerous? Is something big about to happen? These subtle technical points will make your scene not just suspenseful, but artful, as well., Just because the biggest scare or worry has to come last doesn't mean you need to be suspense-free until the final minute. Good suspense artists know that close calls pull you further up in your seat while also giving you a bit of hope for success. Without that balance of fear and hope, you can't get suspense, so be sure to ""pay off"" the viewer to keep them engaged. Ideas include:


The villain just missing his/her strike. Frequently, the hero doesn't know how close they got to dying yet. But the audience does, and it is terrifying.""False scares,"" like when the viewer expects to see the villain, but it is just a stray cat popping out. Be careful about using too many of these, however, as they can feel easy and cheap very quickly if viewers never get real suspense.
Cutting before the climactic action is often a good way to hide the villain or scare for later. It also makes the next time the characters visit that spot extra terrifying."

Watch as many suspenseful scenes as you can get your hands on.,
Use the length of each shot to build, and then release, tension.,
Spend as much time on sound design as visual cuts.,
Cue up the suspenseful music, letting it build slowly throughout the scene.",How to Make a Suspenseful Scene3," Horror movies and thrillers need to be your homework, because editing is finally the place where you get to create the real suspense. You could spend years studying editing, but a quick master-class of your favorite movies will do. For each scene, pull out a notepad and write down:


The length of cuts. Do they use long, slow shots, short and quick cuts, or a combination of both? When do they use each?
How long is the scene, and at what point does each key event happen. You'll be surprised how similar this is in many movies.
What are the music and sound cues? When do they come in, rise, and fall away?
What is the lighting like? How does color, tone, and brightness affect the mood of the scene?, Pay attention to the length of the cuts, and how the juxtapose against each other. While this rule isn't hard and fast, longer cuts tend to build dread and suspense, with shorter cuts breeding action, excitement, and confusion. This is a good way to play with tension and release -- a key to good suspense.


Watch how some movies ""fake"" the release, making you expect a scare, but actually providing nothing terrible (like a cat jumping out). This puts your audience on edge without blowing the big scare.
Remember -- suspense comes from worrying about what is going to happen next, or seeing what is happening and being unable to stop it. Note how your favorite movies build this horror.
Check the climactic basement scene near the end of The Silence of the Lambs for a master course in long takes punctuated by quick bursts of action.

, Sound is actually one of the best, if not the best, way to create tension and suspense. Why? Because it hints at things the viewer can't see, increasing worry, confusion, and dread. From floorboard creaks to the whistling of the wind, chirping crickets to sudden, heart-stopping silence, you can mine a lot more tension out of subtle sounds than most movie viewers ever realize.


You can find thousands of free sound effects online with a quick search. For serious movies, consider paying for access to a professional sound bank.
Silence is key to suspense, especially when broken by a nerve-clenching noise like a sharpening blade, slowly opening door, or sudden breath or whisper.

, You can find hundreds of copyright-free suspense songs on the internet, generally using violins, piano, and ambient noises to build quiet dread. When using music, try to be sparing -- you want your scares to come from visual and sound design, using the music as a final touch to pull it together. Keep it in the background, barely perceptible, to subtly impact your audience without pulling their attention from the scene.



No Country for Old Men famously used no music at all, which created its own unique, silent suspense.

If you use fluorescent lights, you will have a bluish cast.


The brighter the light, the more will be the reflection from the green screen casting a color spill on your subject. Use your softbox lighting kit to neutralize the harshness of the light.;
, Never allow sunlight to fall directly on the lens of the camera. This severely damages the quality of your work. Use a custom lens hood or at least your hand to block the harmful rays.

, When you have a brightly lit background, your foreground will turn dark, thereby underexposing your subject. You can use a reflector to brighten up the foreground. Learn how to identify the backlit situations and try to avoid them as much as possible. They are the biggest reasons for spoiling the quality of the videos.

, Many camcorder enthusiasts don’t understand that while shooting, the subject is supposed to be moving and not the camera. When held with hands, the angle of every shot will vary, thereby making a bizarre video. The camcorder therefore, has to be stable during the shoot and this is not possible when held with hands. Professionals must mount their cameras on a tripod or maybe a simpler one such as a monopod.

, An easy way to do this is to use the proper lighting technique with the help of light sources, reflectors, diffusers, softboxes, etc. Use a reflector to bounce the light into the areas that need it. Use a diffuser to soften the harshness of the light.

, This feature allows you to identify the overexposed areas in your video. The correctly exposed areas will turn green whereas the overexposed ones will become red. Once identified, adjust your video lighting equipment settings to neutralize this.


Adjusting your equipment aptly to light the subject and the green screen is the key to making excellent video. There is no magic rule other than this, which can fulfill your dream of becoming a great cinematographer.

, Your Machinima may be dramatically or comically driven based on the genre. Make sure to include interesting points such as action sequences, bizarre characters, and plot twists. Think up a script of audio or visual effects, ques or music, or camera angles and put them in the order they are used in the scene. This will help the capturer/editor during their part.

, Your Machinima should include a cast of 3 or more different voices. If you can pull it off and make it convincing, change your voice and use it for different characters.

, There are three methods for filming Halo Machinima. Using Xbox Live can be useful for a big battle scene that is spontaneous and does not involve lowered weapons. Using split screen is good for coordinated interactions between multiple characters. Using System Link is good for coordinated interactions between even more characters.

, Record audio before you film the video. Do not try to record multiple people's voices while acting out a scene. Have your capturer/editor go into an Xbox Live party and record the dialogue separately from the scene acting. This will save a lot of time from resetting the scenery after errors.

, Set dates, times, and scenes to be shot. Also, you may want to bring food and drinks if you're shooting locally.

, Once all scenes are shot enter Theatre Mode and capture takes. Its common to use the flying (detached) camera so the capturer has more control over the angles.

, There are three methods of capturing the recorded takes. A capture card is a small device with an A/V input that either goes directly into your computer or plugs into the USB drive or Firewire drive on your computer. A Digital Video Camera is a type of camera with an A/V In drive and a Firewire output drive. Bungie Pro is a service that allows you to spend money in order to render saved films and clips. Each has its negatives and positives based on your personal preferences.

, Once footage is captured, you need to import into your preferred editing program. Make sure to sync audio and video together. It's also a good choice to render the video in multiple formats to make it more accessible.

, Once the video is finished, you should put it on a video site such as Machinima.com or YouTube. You can also make the video available for download on your own site.

If you are planning to make a fiction film, then it's narrative. Think of a basic story idea. You can get ideas for films from things you read in daily life, short stories, newspapers, etc.;
, Write out your script, using Celtx; if you have never written a script before, pick up a book that explains script writing and character development, and that—along with the Celtx program—will be all you will need.

, Begin this by thinking of the names of the characters, the time of the story (Is it 10 years from now? Is it a hundred years before our time?), think of it how the story starts.

,, Decide what each shot in the movie is going to be. For example, wide shot, over the shoulder, tracking shot, close up, extreme close up, medium wide shot. crane shot, dolly shot, etc.

, This is called a breakdown sheet.

, Is it external (EXT) or internal (INT)?

,,,, Look for actors. Try looking for actors in your neighborhood, your school, anywhere. Your actors could be your friends, your family members, your classmates. Hold auditions for your actors. Make sure when you audition your them, they are right for the character, they should have similar attitudes, they should pretend they are the character they are portraying. That way, you could have the right person for the job and won't be able to mess their character during your production filming. For crew you are going to need as many people as possible, but at least the following:

Camera person






Director of photography

, Write down all the characters in the movie and what their role is. Click here to learn about how to come up with great ideas about character making.

, Come up with a storyline that the characters will be involved in. Try not to force yourself to think of a ""great Hollywood blockbuster"", just follow your heart.

, Write out all the scenes and lines the characters will be in. Make separate sheets of dialogues for actors.

, Get actors to play as your characters in the movie and producers for financing (i.e. providing money for) the movie.


For action movies, it is good to hire an action choreographer for choreographing fight and stunt scenes. Its not necessary if you can come up with cool action sequences yourself!

, If doing scenes in a closed area or inside a building, try making appropriate sets according to the scene to give the movie a professional look.

, Make your schedule about when and where you would start shooting the scenes and inform all the cast about the schedule. This would help all of the cast and crew to be prepared and having been done their homework before the day of the shoot.

, Check every instrument and equipment like camera, tripods, microphones (if using them) etc are working well. This would avoid any faults and errors at the time of the shoot thereby saving you from the frustration of delays and loss of budget.

, Arrive at the location earlier then the rest of the crew and explore if the location is good to shoot under the given circumstances (look for bad weather or the crowd present at the place.)

, Make sure the scenes would be shot the right way, for example you shot a great scene only to discover the shadows of the whole crew behind the camera could be seen on the shot you just took!

, After all the things are made ready, approach the actors and/or actresses and remind them about the scene and what they have to perform in the scene. This is the main job of the director to make sure actors perform their best on every scene.

, The way you will shoot your scenes in the movie would also part your movie from the ""unprofessional."" Try taking shots the following way to get the best out of every performance :


Take long shots. Taking a long shot would give you the overall view of the particular scene and all the actors and props inside the frame of your movie. A long shot is basically a shot taken from a far place.






Car and character chase scenes consist of shots taken from a far place. This makes the scene good as the audience could see where the person is running towards and people following him etc.


Taking shots with a full view . A full view shot is a shot with only your characters and a background behind them.






These shots look good when used in depicting a close combat fight.


Taking medium shots. Medium shots are quiet like closeups but not too close to give facial details (from head to torso.)






Try taking these shots for scenes with discussion going between 2-3 people. This gives the scene a little ""what's going on?"" kind of feeling.


The closeup shot. Closeup shots are best for showing a specific important scene of a character or a particular thing.


, Don't just stick up to a few shots, instead take several shots from different camera angles so that you'll have a lot of shots to choose from while editing the movie.

, After you've transferred the collections of shots of scenes from the memory device of the camera to your computer, you are ready for editing the movie in your computer. Click here if you are not sure how to transfer your videos from your digital camera to your computer.

, Delete the scenes that you find the least interesting. Show scenes from different views that you've shot using camera angles. Cutting smaller clips and mixing them with the same clips of that particular scene will make them more interesting.

, Adding effects make the movie more interesting, either if they are visual effects or sound effects.


Some fight scenes are also choreographed with music, and sound effects give them more of a ""Wow"" feeling!

, At the beginning and at the end of the movie, add titles and credits. Adding credits and titles displays the names of the crew members along with the work they did on the movie.

, After backing up the whole project on your hard drive, burn the final product on a DVD.

, Give the idea or completed film to a publisher. Make sure you edit your movie before you send it out to any publishers.

, Use various video-sharing websites like Youtube, Dailymotion etc. To learn about how to make trailers for your movie click here. Uploading trailers of your movie will make you aware about the movie reviews from the audience.

",How to Make a Student Movie," Depending on what your movie is like will probably alter this, but in general, there are some characters you would like in your movie. They are referred to by these names:


The Techs. These are the editors of the movies, the guys who add in the special effects. For example, when the wizard teleports, these would be the guys to talk to about putting in the magical ""Whoosh"" sound. Ideally, they should have these traits:

A large selection of sound effects and music. [The music could be brought by someone else, but it's more simple this way.
Good movie editing software, like iMovie by Apple. This requires a Macintosh computer , however, and seeing that many people do not have that type of software available, it is highly advisable they have some editing software other than Windows Movie Maker. If you only need movie editing software for a few days--likely you will--perhaps you should consider using the Blaze Media Pro trial version. They should also have knowledge of how to use these, so being good readers is always a plus, especially when resorting to having to use trial versions of new software.
Some sound editing software doesn't hurt either; Audacity can really come in handy for this. It's open source and will let you fool around with music from, say, The Matrix Original Soundtrack. And most likely sound effects, too.


The Boss. More commonly known as the director, this is the guy who basically runs the show. There are multiple things that the Boss should have; well-rounded skills, intelligence, etc. Most likely, the best thing that the Boss could have in his/her repertoire of skills is:

A powerful imagination. This is so that he can easily see the movie using his mind's eye. How he can see the terrain, the angles, etc. Note: It is possible to go over the edge with this. If they're imagining a fight with lasers on the moon and you don't have any props ready to use for that, they'll need to imagine something else.
Powerful writing and linguistic skills. The writing is for the writing of the script, which will come in later on in the movie. They should be able to write quite large amounts in short spaces of times; in other words, gifted. They also need to have conflict resolution, because no matter how well you are all prepared, there will be at least one squabble that will break out. Linguistic skills are usually the most important part of the Boss, as he/she will need to describe how things look to him, explain the camera angles and their purpose, etc.
Xeneological training. Xeneology, a term coined by one of our own wikiHow authors, is ""the study of random and strange facts."" Many people who are addicted to Wikipedia can be like this, but having them visit sites such as http://www.dumbfacts.com/ can increase this. This is important, because of the doors it opens up. Not everybody knows what a polymath is. So putting one in the movie makes it more interesting. Maybe not if it's a main character, but almost always for a side character.
Important! Make sure that either one of the Techs or the Boss are not also playing a character in the movie, as someone needs to hold the camera!


The Actors. These are the so-called centerpieces of the stage, the real artists. Far from true. If all they do is act, why, are they really more than robots? Nevertheless, all groups need great actors. All actors need great minds to back them up, unless they themselves are polymaths and are gifted with great minds as well. The traits an Actor should hopefully have are:

The ability to enter an altered state of consciousness, commonly known to actors. In other words, the ability to be, not just to portray their character. This can only be honed with practice.
The ability to portray a wide range of emotions. Going down bawling with tears doesn't suit quite well a quiet moment on the terrace where Antonio wants to beak up with Claire, now does it? Being able not only to look like you're going to stab someone to that one soft tear stroking down your cheek is the true sign of acting. Learning to be able to fake cry is immensely helpful, and will get you loads of points in your film if used right.


Those are the main three ""types"" of characters that you could use in your group. Other than that, there are less-needed things like extras, costume designers, etc. Most of those other types are usually only to enhance the movie, and aren't a real necessity.;
, Stoicism practices indifference to things and a belief that people should accept suffering without complaining. This should be instilled early on, and instilled very deeply. Make sure that all of your group members are ready to accept that while they may have a differing opinion to what is going to be performed, for the good of the movie and possibly the grades, they must follow it.

, This is fairly obvious, usually, who goes where. But in the event that you have some difficulty deciding what actor should portray a certain character, have them both act a little like them and use your judgement.

, Before you start a movie, you need to write a script. Make sure that everyone in the book reads and obeys this religiously! Otherwise you could end up with a terrible improvised movie.

Put together your equipment.,

Plan and budget your set-pieces first.",How to Make an Action Movie1," The action movie hero or heroine is the core of your movie. They dictate what ""kind"" of action movie you're watching (spy, heist, war, sci-fi, Western, etc.), the setting, and the general plot of the movie. A lot of the popular action movies are character driven, (Bond, Kill Bill, Die Hard, The Hunger Games, etc), which is why they get so many sequels. People love the main character in these movies, so make sure we love yours. A good hero:



Is competent. They will find a way to defeat the bad guy, and generally act calm under pressure.

Has something worth fighting for. It could the abduction of a child (Taken), or the desire to save the world and do their duty, (every Bond movie ever). In general the more specific the need, the better the movie.

Is relatable. You might ask how a super spy is relatable to the average person, but there is always a way. This is why John McClain is just an everyday cop on Christmas vacation, why many good heroes always seem to have a sense of humor, and all of Tarantino's action stars spend a scene or two just chatting with friends about pop culture.You can write groups of heroes too, as evidenced by The Avengers, Mission Impossible, and Ocean's 11. Still, all of these movies still have 1-2 central characters that the audience can follow and bond with (ie. Iron Man/Captain America, Ethan Hunt, Danny Ocean).;
, A good villain is the secret weapon of a great action movie. For evidence, look no further than Star Wars and its arguably most famous character, Darth Vader. Good villains bring out the best in your hero by amplifying the action and tension, so don't just throw in a generically evil Russian or murderous alien without trying to make your villain unique. Good villains:


Are challenging. They cannot be easily beaten, and usually have the upper hand for the majority of the movie.
Have understandable motives. The audience needs to believe that the villain has reasons for his/her behavior other than ""they are evil.""
Will do anything to reach his/her/its goals. Agent Smith in The Matrix is a great villain simply because he is unfazed even by death. He has a goal, and he will do anything possible to make it a reality.Is the opposite of your hero. This makes the conflict especially poignant. Both Vader and Luke had their families murdered but took different paths out. Both Frodo and Gollum held the ring, but one resisted and one succumbed. This ying/yang is the basis of all good conflicts., Action movies are generally unique because of their villains, settings, and heroes. They are not often known for highly original plots or stories. This allows you to focus more on original action, characters, and settings instead of plots. You'll find that 99% of all action movies follow this structure almost perfectly, even when they seem ""different"":The Set-Up: This introduces the characters, setting, and the world of the movie. More often than not it is with an action scene showing the hero or villain at work, as you want to get to an action scene within the first 10 pages. We need to know why the hero is the hero, and why they're awesome.

The Opportunity/Issue: A major problem or crisis arises. The villain strikes again or makes themselves known to the hero, a mission is assigned, the team is put together, etc. This is when the movie must kick into high gear, as the mission gets started. This is roughly the 1/3 mark of your script.

The Point of No Return: Hot on the trail of the villain, the hero(s) have had some major successes (usually shown by action scenes) by now. They have the villain on the ropes and the conflict is escalating. This is roughly the halfway point of the movie.

The Major Set-Back: Something terrible happens that puts the entire mission in jeopardy -- the hero is captured, a trusted friend dies, the group fails to avert a crisis, the villain has a secret plan, etc. This moment needs to bring the hero(s) as low as they can go. This comes at the 75% mark of your story.

The Climax: Your main character(s) has a final push to save themselves and the world either by escaping or defeating the villain. This must be your biggest or best set-piece, the action scene or fight that is the culmination of the entire movie.The Resolution: With the villain defeated, the last 5-10 pages show the conclusion of the adventure -- the villain in jail, the two heroes kissing, or even the brief of the next mission.

, They don't necessarily need a ton of acting experience, but they do need to be willing to work long hours to get your movie made. Make sure they are willing and able to take orders from the director. To save your money and time, try and get actors with decent athletic ability, allowing them to sell stunts and action scenes with ease.


You should highly consider hiring a stunt coordinator is you want to do any large-scale stunts or professional fights. They will bring ideas, experience, and safety equipment that you need to shoot properly., Making a movie takes a lot of gear, including cameras, microphones, lights, and special effects. You need to be sure you have everything you need to film before you start shooting.



Cameras: You'll generally need at least 2 cameras, and preferably 3. However, modern camera advancements have made it possible to film a movie with an iPhone 6, or Go Pro cameras. Most importantly, you want cameras that shoot in the same format (1080i, for example), otherwise the video quality will change with every cut.

Microphones: If you're short on cash then spend you money on audio equipment, as audiences are proven to notice bad sound before video. While you can use the attached camera microphones, a Tascam or shotgun mic is a great investment to instantly improve your movie.Lighting: 5-10 cheap clamp lights and extension cords have lit many an indie film, but get a professional 3 or 5 piece kit if you can. However, variety of bulbs, clamp lights found at home-improvement stores, and high-heat spray paint (to color light bulbs) is a great substitute.Essential Accessories: You'll need memory cards, a backup hard drive, tripods, light reflectors, extension cords, black tape (to cover or tape down wires), and computer video editing software. You may also want some fake blood., Action movies are known for eye-popping scenery and locations, which may seem daunting to an independent filmmaker. But good locations are not only on beaches and mountains. Blue Ruin, for example, is one of the most visually striking action movies in years but takes place on rural roads, plain forests, and bland suburban houses.


Go location scouting with a camera or a friend to find small areas that you could shoot in.
Adapt your script, when necessary, to fit new locations if you can't afford to go somewhere ""perfect."" This can lead to surprising innovations.If you want specific locations, like sci-fi cockpits or spy agencies, you may need to build your own set.

, Set-pieces are the action scenes. They are the 3-5 big moments in your script, from the opening action scene to the climactic showdown at the end. These are the hardest things for an indie filmmaker to put together because most set pieces cost a lot of money, time, and crew members to pull off. The challenge is to think about ways you can create a great set-piece with limited resources. From there, you need to make simple budget, see how much each scene will cost, and adapt your script accordingly.Chase scenes are a staple of action movies, but filming a bunch of cars at high speeds on the road is nearly impossible without a huge budget. But running characters, bikes, or hiding from the villain in a cool location are all much more doable. Look, for example, at the conclusion of Silence of the Lambs, which is a great, tense basement chase.
Rescues, bomb diffusion, and other preventative scenes are a great way to build suspense on a budget. You don't need to pay for an explosion special effect or gory death scene because the hero rescues everyone in time.
Cat and Mouse scenes, when two characters sneak around each other, trying to get the upper hand, cost very little and are great ways to build tension before a fight scene.
Check out prop warehouses online for cheap ways to spice up action scenes. A great prop can make any scene much more exciting and original, and can come from anywhere. Jason Borne kills a man with a toothbrush, for example, in one of the best action scenes of the last decade."

Out of earshot, out of mind.,
Try different effects.,
Try to TRY again.",How to Sample Music Safely and Effectively,";
, If it is old enough, odds are someone has sampled it. You will notice a sound occurring in many different songs, all seeming to have the same origin. If you listen to Heavy D & The Boyz (and who doesn't?) and on the song 'Don't Curse' you hear that funky brass and drum combo looped throughout, you owe that pleasure to The J.B.'s, one of the most sampled groups of all time (you've probably already Google them by this point), and that particular sample comes from their (awesome) 'Pass the Peas', a very funky song.

, What this means is that use only sample songs that sound great, but are lesser known. If someone sampled something from The Beatles, you get your, uh, butt handed to you. Intense pressure from record labels, and the corporate Pitbulls under their employ, have caused more lawsuits than 3 Million R. Kelly's.

, It can be a cheesy old George Romero horror film from the 1960s, or a mad sitarist from Calcutta. If it sounds cool, and can be cleared, use it. Why not.

, If a sample is iffy, put it deep in the mix. It is kind of sneaky, but if something from Led Zeppelin is just UNAVOIDABLE, put it under 500 other sounds, and hope no one notices.

, Another idea for samples, both clear, and iffy, is to mix it up. Add effects. Add distortion, flanger, chorus, reverb, spacer, vocalizer, echo, slow it down, speed it up! The music world is your oyster.

, If one sample doesn't work out with the rest, a key good side is that there are almost an INFINITE amount of songs to sample.

Get to know how to read and follow sheet music by picking a piece that you already know.,
Annotate your sheet music.,
Begin with simple pieces and work your way up.,
Label chords.,
Remember that practice makes perfect!",How to Simplify Sheet Music," Try something popular that you have known for a while, such as the opening for Fur Elise.


Play the piece with the music and watch the progressions - see how they fit together.
Circle the sections that you think you know well enough to begin playing/ putting into practice and highlight in a different colour the sections you think you will really need to focus on.
Listen to the music on it's own and try to picture the sheet music in your head.;
, After you have listened to the piece and are confident in how the piece sounds altogether, make sure that you label finger patterns for particularly tricky passages.


This means looking at things you have figured out how to play a certain way and making a note of it.
You may have your own method, but the typical taught process is that the thumb on either hand is 1 and the little finger is 5. If you label up this information on your sheet music, then you won't forget it when you are practicing again a few days later (though muscle memory will eventually set in and remember this for you the more you practice)
Don't feel you need to label everything - just label up the information that you think it is most important to have a note of.

, If you are a beginner in your instrument (this article is written with piano in mind), pick out something which is a little simpler than that which you eventually wish to play. You'll work your way up as you perfect your technique.


If you go to your local music shop or look online, there are bound to be lots of collections of short songs or pieces with information included to help you get to grips with the basics.
If you work your way up from the foundation, then you will have a strong sight reading skill level and this is incredibly important if you want to go on to study your instrument professionally, particularly in the classical industry.

, This can be the most useful way to simplify sheet music for instruments such as guitar and piano, even other instruments at times (e.g. a long flute arpeggio - it can be useful to just know the key and to bear this in mind instead of trying to learn each of the notes individually)


This will also be useful for your level of analysis. Use a keyboard and a chord chart which you can write out yourself, in order to pick out each of the chords
As you previously would have linked your technical notes with the sheet music, now write underneath the passages you feel are most important the chordal progressions.
This is an easy and quick way to simplify your piece and learn the basics of it before working on to take the piece to the next best level.

, This information will be a lot to absorb and some of it works better for others than it may do for you. A lot of the approach in music is about you and finding out what works best for you in your practice. Only time will reveal that.


Work hard - if you put thought and dedication into your work, you will provide yourself the motivation to succeed and will soon find the results you seek.
Record your efforts so that you can see how you are progressing. No progress is evident straight away and the process is never really obvious to you in the moment if you are the one practicing.
There will be good days and bad days. Some days, like with sport, you will not be able to remember things as well as you would another. Pace your practice with the music so that you can come back to it and not feel afraid or angry - these two things kill focus and motivation.
Keep at it - it is all about repetition and practice. Make sure you do the recommended portion of practice on your instrument every day (lots of this information is online, but for a none body based instrument, anything apart from vocals, they recommend 4 - 6 hours a day professional/ student practice)
Practice your sight reading skills beyond this piece you want to simplify. If you do a bit of sight reading of a new piece you have never heard every day, you will start to apply these skills by second nature and will not really need to focus in on anything else than on the music.

Start with high-quality audio tracks.,
Locate the vocals in the mix.,
Import the audio into the editing software of your choice.,
Break the channels into separate tracks.,
Select one of the channels to invert.,
Invert the channel.,
Convert the file back to mono.",How to Remove Vocals from Songs1," If you put low-quality files into your editing software, it's not going to sound good when you start trying to take stuff out. It's important to start with .wav or .flac files and work from there. The results will be a lot more clear than you'll get from a super-compressed .mp3 file.;
, Stereo tracks all have two separate channels, with the instruments and vocals spread across them. Bass, guitar, and other channels will typically be pushed to one side or the other, while vocals are normally placed in the ""center channel."" This is done to make them sound ""centered."" To isolate them, you'll split this center channel and invert one of them.


How can you tell where the vocals are? Just listen in good-quality headphones. If the vocals seem to be coming out of both channels simultaneously, they're mixed in the center. If not, they're to the side that you hear the vocals coming from.
Some styles of music and specific recordings will have different balances between channels. If the vocals are shifted to one channel or the other instead of ""centered,"" it's much easier to remove them.
Songs with a lot of effects may be quite difficult to separate and invert. There may be a little echo of the vocals that will be difficult to remove.

, You can do this basic process in any editing software that allows you to invert tracks for a particular channel. While the exact location of the tool for each will vary slightly, the basic process is the same for the following programs:


Audacity
Pro Tools
Ableton
Reason

, In most programs, you can break a high quality sound file recorded in stereo into the two tracks. You should see a black arrow next to the track title, which you can click and select, ""Split Stereo Track."" You should then have the separate channels to work with individually., Since they both have vocals embedded in the tracks, select either one. Double-click to select the entire track if you want to remove the vocals on the entire song.

, Once you've selected the track, invert it using the ""Effect"" function and selecting ""Invert."" The song might sound a little strange after you play it. After inverting, the track should sound like it’s coming from the sides, instead of the middle.


You should still be able to hear vocals some, but don't worry. You'll complete the effect when you bounce it back to mono.

, Combine the two stereo channels back into one channel. You should now have one combined track that should have a more diminished amplitude. That means the vocals will be massaged out and the instrumentation will be usable. You may still hear faint hints of the original singer hiding in the background.

Review everything in advance and plan for the worst.,
Light your shots with clear, consistent light.,
Focus on blocking for each scene, especially action scenes.,
Shoot fight scenes up tight and close.,
Shoot your B-roll shots whenever you have downtime.",How to Make an Action Movie2," You'll need people who can help you film, as making an action movie will be impossible by yourself. Whenever possible, get a crew that will be consistent and there every day you shoot so that you can develop a rhythm together. Positions you need to consider include:



Director of Photography (DP): Arguably the most important job, your DP is in charge of cameras and lights. It is incredibly difficult to effectively light a scene, set up the cameras and angles, and direct the camera man if you're also coaching actors, checking the set design, reading the script, and otherwise directing the movie. Even a friend with a background in photography is better than nothing.

Camera and microphone operators: Self-explanatory, but essential crew members. Look for friends or people online who have at least a little experience.

Make-up Artist: While anyone can do this, their main job is continuity. Unless a lot of time goes by in your film, you need the actor's face and costumes to look identical in every single scene, otherwise the audience will notice the changes. Take pictures every day of the costume, make-up and scenes to make sure it looks the same.

Sound Engineer: Listen to all the sound as it is being recorded, ensuring that it is right. Like the DP, the sound engineer deals with the nitty-gritty of audio recording so that you don't have to.

Production Assistant: These people (known as PAs) do whatever needs to be done-- preparing food and coffee, wiping memory cards, and helping set up or trigger special effects.

, A shot list is simply every angle that you need to capture each day you're shooting. This helps you work effectively and make sure all the relevant details are on film for the final movie. To make one, simply draw out the scene in basic comic book form. Show every shot that you need to capture, even if it is with stick figures.


Get every single detail you need, from important props (the gun on the table your hero notices) to the structure of the action scenes.
Movies are not shot like plays, where every scene is captured in real time. Frequently you'll shoot a 2-second clip, like a reveal of the gun on the table, all by itself. It is then edited into the final scene later.

, You need to be the first one on set and the last one to leave every day you're shooting. Things are going to go wrong when actors get sick or the weather won't cooperate, so you need to be flexible with every decision you make. That flexibility is only possible if you show up prepared.


Review the day's shot list so that you know in advance what you need to get. If something goes wrong you should know what scenes you can cut, move to another day, or shoot quickly.
Rehearse with the actors several days in advance. Fight scenes, in particular, need to be choreographed and rehearsed well in advance.
Review lighting and camera positions. No one wants to sit around while you fiddle with lights. You and your camera crew should have them ready before they arrive., This is the number one mistake of young filmmakers. You believe that to get dark, moody lighting effects you need a dark set. This will always lead to grainy, ugly footage. Instead, focus on making good, clear shadows and nice, fully clear light spots -- most of the styling (like dark and grimy, or vibrant and energetic) is done in post-production.


Cameras need light to take smooth video. This is why you always darken the footage while editing instead of trying to shoot in the dark.
Use natural light whenever possible, especially the hour after sunrise and before sunset. These are the ""golden hours,"" and it's hard to make a film look bad when shot at this time. Even overcast days are great for even, no-nonsense lighting.Colored lights, specifically greens, reds, and blues, can create a wonderfully unique atmosphere for your scenes, like those used in the recent action flick John Wick., Blocking is where the actors are and where they go, and having movement carefully choreographed is essential in an action movie. Most importantly, it needs to be consistent. This is because most of your scenes can't be shot right in a row -- you may shoot the actor running up to a ledge and jumping off it separately, then edit it together to make it look seamless. But if the actor is always running up to a different part of the ledge the audience may notice the ""cheat.""


Fight and stunt choreography are art forms on their own, and you should hire a stunt coordinator. At the very least you should have actors or advisers knowledgeable about martial arts to set up clean, effective fight blocking.
Let the camera do the movement whenever possible, not the actors. The less your actors need to move, the easier your job lighting, shooting, and editing will be., The best way to sell a good punch is up close and personal. Get as many cameras as you can and keep them trained on moving parts, flying punches, and reactions so it almost feels like you are right in the middle of the fight.


Again, you need to be consistent with your fight scenes, not improvising them every time. This makes editing much, much easier.

, The hero driving, the location she/he just arrived at, the weapons on the table -- these little shots are called B-roll and are essential to your movie. These shots are the connective tissue of your movie and they are used to create atmosphere and build the world of your movie. In between scenes, get shots of the actors exploring the set, or sitting and talking about something before the scene begins. These shots will make your life much, much easier later on.


You should also shoot every location without the actors. These shots are perfect to introduce a scene, such as when a character walks into a room for the first time and we ""see"" them exploring it through their eyes."

Watch and takes notes on every action movie you can get your hands on.,
Build dramatic irony in your scenes to create tension.,
Use quick cuts to make your action scenes sing.,
Add in your special effects.,
Correct the color and add you credits and effects.,
Use sound effects to build the world of the movie subtly.",How to Make an Action Movie3," Editing is where a bunch of random footage becomes a tense, well-wrought adventure, and the best way to learn is from the masters. One suggestion is to take notes not only of what happens, but the minute it happens on. When do action scenes occur? How far apart are they? How do editors build up the tension to keep you on the edge of your seat?


You'll notice that most action movies have a very specific rhythm. The build excitement and energy from the get-go with quick scenes and lots of movement, but temper it with 3-4 moments of quiet, allowing the audience to catch its breath before the next big action scene.

, Editing is when dramatic irony becomes your best friend. Dramatic irony is when the audience knows something that the character doesn't. We might see the outline of the villain, but the characters can't. Master director Alfred Hitchcock talks about having a bomb under the table the characters don't know about. By cutting between the ticking clock, the action hero rushing to save them, and the unawares victims, you build great tension and suspense. Just blowing up the bomb is surprising, but only for a fleeting moment.Think of the climax of The Dark Knight, as we cut between the boat with the Joker's victims, Batman, and the police's desperate attempts to do something.

, Unless you've got dedicated stunt people willing to take a real punch, you'll need to be an expert editor to make an action scene look good. Go for quick cuts, rapidly cutting between the tussling bodies, as this leads to a frantic, high-energy fight or action scene the moves along quickly. Watch any action movie and notice how short each shot is -- the faster the cut, the faster the action feels.


If you can, however, pay to go slow. The Borne Ultimatum features a now-famous fight scene that hardly cuts at all. The result showed the brutality of the fight, as if even the camera/editor couldn't flinch and turn away.

, This is the hardest part of any action movie, as modern adventures are shot with millions of dollars of poured into special effects. This can make it nearly impossible to get any great effects, but that doesn't mean that some work with Adobe AfterEffects, Maya, or any other effects software would hurt if you have some experience. You can also put any footage on your green screen now to complete it.


Play with the built-in effects, including screen distortions and filters, especially in key moments. One common one, for example, is to blur/shake the screen when someone gets punched.

, Remember, however, that effects like explosions and fire can look tacky and out when done poorly, so stick to color correction and grading, compositing, or ambient effects such as fog or dust particles. You can use free programs, like DaVinci Resolve, or Adobe After Effects to handle the color and put basic effects into the movie.


Color grading is when you make the whole film have a similar color pallet. For action movies, you can go two ways -- dark and gray, like Behind Enemy Lines or Saving Private Ryan, or you can go vibrant and energetic, like Mission Impossible, or Smokin' Aces.You can buy pre-made color gradings, called LUTs, that are incredibly helpful for getting a specific look to your film.

, Sound design is absolutely crucial to movie-making. The best sound design, however, is usually unnoticed since it fits into the fold of the movie. In order to make a good action movie you'll need much more than cool effects -- you'll need realistic sound effects to back all your images up.


This includes music as well, which is often loud, triumphant, and fast. If you cannot record the music yourself, be sure to use ""royalty free music,"" which can be found online and is free to use in a movie without worrying about lawsuits.
You can sign up for sound effect libraries and databases online, many of which have professional quality sounds to use.
Many first-time directors can get more bang for their buck sending the film to a sound-production facility, which will add sound effects and mix your dialog so it sounds natural."

Choose vocal eliminator software.,
Install an audio equalizer software package.,
Open the song file and follow the instructions.,
Adjust the audio equalizer to preserve the bass tones.",How to Remove Vocals from Songs2," Vocal eliminator software packages are available on the Internet, for a variety of prices. Some vocal eliminator software packages may be downloaded for free, but most are available only through a purchase.Each software package provides instructions for installation. Here's a little of different packages at a variety of prices:


Vocal Remover Pro
IPE MyVoice Karaoke
Roland R-MIX
E-Media MyVoice
WaveArts Dialog

, Audio equalizer software packages are not available for free download and must be purchased. Installation instructions will be provided with the package. Make sure that the audio eliminator is compatible with your operating system and the sound files you're using. Some audio equalizers include:


Profound Sound CSharp
Equalizer APO
Graphic Equalizer Pro
Boom 2

, Each software package works differently, but will offer a tutorial specific to the software to help guide you through the process. It's quite easy, especially on software specifically made for helping you record karaoke tracks. The software will execute the removal of the audio tracks automatically.


With an equalizer, you'll usually just open the audio equalizer software and play the music file you want to edit. The audio equalizer will remove of the audio tracks automatically.

, To make sure you don't lose the bass, it's important to make a few adjustments. Set the signal attenuation for +5 dB at 200 Hz and below on both the left and right channels. This will preserve the bass tones.

Understand the concept of channel phase.,
Find the wires leading into the back of one speaker.,
Use a digital phase processor.,
Adjust the levels to accommodate for the loss of vocals.",How to Remove Vocals from Songs3," Two sound waves moving up and down together are said to be ""in phase."" When one of the waves is moving up at the same time as the other wave moves down, the waves are said to be ""out of phase."" Out-of-phase waves cancel each other out, resulting in a flat line of sound.Flipping the phase on one speaker will cancel the matching signal's waves in the other speaker.The efficiency of this as a technique is pretty debatable. It may theoretically work, but it's not a way to save a song file without vocals.

, Each speaker usually has two wires going into it, one with a positive lead and one with a negative lead. Usually these are red and white, black and red, or black and white. Sometimes, they're black and black. Swap the two wires going into one speaker around.


Where the black wire was connected, connect the red wire, and move the red wire to the black wire's terminal.
Many modern stereo systems and head phones do not allow you to swap wires on the back of one speaker. Sometimes the wires are bundled into one wire sleeve. The only way to swap the bundled wires is to splice them or re-solder the connector.

, There are special digital techniques using chips called Digital Signal Processors to do the flipping of the wave inside the stereo or hi-fi. Usually the button is a ""Karaoke"" button, which flips the one side of the stereo image phase.


If your stereo or app has one of these, then just press it and the Lead Vocals will get very soft or disappear.

, Background vocals are often mixed more to the left or right, so these are hard to remove. You will have to sing along with them and pretend they are your very own backing choir, if you're trying to make a karaoke track.


Flipping phase really affects Bass waves. So the Bass might disappear along with the Lead Vocals. Digital DSP Karaoke systems will fix this by flipping the phase on only the Vocal frequencies. Try adjusting the levels on your stereo to get it to sound correct.
Sophisticated vocal removal systems or software allow you to decide which frequencies get flipped out of phase.

Publish your album if you’re looking to earn money from it.,
Select a performing rights organization.,
Choose a name for your publishing business.,
Form your business as a legal entity.,
Register your album (as its publisher) with your chosen PRO.",How to Publish Your Own Music Album1," In the simplest of terms, you want to publish your music because of the money. If you want all the money due from a public performance of your song (such as radio play), the song (and/or album) should be published by a music publisher and registered with a performing rights organization (PRO).


You can try to find a reputable music publisher who’s willing to take you on as a client, or publish your own music and register with a PRO.
It is possible that you may be able to register your music with a PRO and earn royalties without working with or becoming a publisher. Consult an attorney for the laws and rules where you live and/or create music.;
, In the U.S., you can choose between three PROs: ASCAP, BMI, or SESAC. Look them up on the Internet, gather information on them, and choose the one that best suits your needs.


As a publisher, you can register with multiple PROs, but you can only (and need only) register a single work (like an album) with one PRO.Outside the U.S., look for PROs that operate in your country, such as SOCAN in Canada.

, To become the publisher of your own album, you’ll need to create a business name. It's suggested that you pick three names out, just in case your first preference is already being used. PROs (and you) do not want the money you should be receiving going to someone else, so they will reject names that are even similar to names already registered with their or another organization.

, After the name clearance with your chosen PRO, you should form a business in your state or country. This process will vary based upon where you live and/or operate, but may be fairly simple if your business is just going to be you.


However, if more than one person is involved in the business (such as co-writers, band mates, etc.), it's strongly recommended that you form a more structured business, for example a Limited Liability Company (LLC) or Corporation. The operating agreement or by-laws for the business should address who does what, who owns what, how members are compensated, how new members join, and how members can leave.
It is entirely possible to set up a LLC or alternate business entity without assistance, but it may be easier for you to consult with a knowledgeable attorney.

, After acceptance of your publisher application by the organization, each of your songs/albums published by your publishing company should be registered with the organization. Register your new album, and make sure to include the name of your publisher (the company you’ve created) and your PRO on distributed copies of your album (physical or digital).


For example: If your songs are played, the radio station lets ASCAP know that they played your songs and sends ASCAP a check. ASCAP then looks up the album on their registration, finds it registered to “Your Name Music Publishing,” and cuts you a check."

Make sure you're ready to share your music with the world.,
Discover your brand.,
Know your target audience.",How to Promote Your Music1," This is the most important point. If you promote a bad track, or even a bad album, it'll be hard to bounce back. It's better to wait until you're absolutely ready to share your music with the world than to put out some music you'll regret making later. Here are some tips for knowing when you're ready to share your music:If you can, get feedback from respected people in the industry first. Build relationships with producers and ask them if they like a track. Once at least 60% of them think it's worth sharing, take that as a go-ahead because producers will be more critical than your fans. Remember that you have to take the time to build these relationships first.
Check out a music feedback service, which can help you share your music with other listeners and get feedback just a few days later. This is a great resource if you don't have as many connections in the professional world, or if you care more about getting in touch with potential fans than producers. Singrush.com is a platform where artists, bands, and producers can host their music for free and compete with one another, with the top liked song in each genre being showcased weekly.;
, Though promoting your music is the most important thing, you have to realize that you're promoting yourself as well. You should see that you're not just a musician or a band member but that you are a product. This product has to be as appealing as possible, so you have to find a way to make your brand as unique and exciting as you can so that fans are excited about you and your music.Think of yourself as Jessica Simpson or Kim Kardashian. These women understand that they are brands and can put their names on a product, from shoes to lotion, knowing that it will sell big just because of who they are.

, Even the best music can get the worst response if it's in the hands of the wrong fanbase. If you're into Techno music, learn to tell the difference between Deep House, Tech House, and Electro. Understand what type of music you're really creating and who that type of music appeals to most of all. This will help you reach out to fans, book the right venues, and sell your music the right way.

Decide which CD you want.,
Think about the possibility that you may have problems finding it.,
Once you know of the overall availability of the CD and are determined to own it, decide how you will purchase this CD.",How to Shop for Music CDs1," It's probably best to buy a CD that you've read reviews about or if you've heard a couple of tracks already.That way you won't have to deal with the feeling of buying a CD that you feel was a waste of money.

, Is it an old CD? Is the artist popular in your country/region? Has the CD even been released in your country? These along with other factors will need to be thought-over before you start searching for a music CD. Unfortunately, there'll be times when you reach a dead-end.

, Below are the three main and most popular methods.

"
"
Think about using an established music publisher.,
Consider utilizing a publishing administrator instead.,
Work directly with an online music service as another option.,
Decide if a little more money or time is most valuable to you.",How to Publish Your Own Music Album2," Do so especially if you prefer a more hands-off approach to publishing your album. The publishing rights organizations (PROs) that operate in your country will likely have online lists of affiliated publishers, possibly searchable by the titles of songs they have published. You can also check out the liner notes of your favorite CDs and see who the publishers are.Landing a successful publisher is far from a sure thing, of course. Try to build up a network of contacts with various publishers, artists, and others in the music business, and be prepared to be turned down one or maybe many times.

, A publishing administrator performs essentially the same functions as a traditional publisher, but is a more recent creation of the digital age. If you are particularly concerned about proper royalty collection when your album is downloaded, streamed, or used online, signing up with a publishing administrator — such as TuneCore, for example — might be worth your consideration.A publishing administrator may charge a one-time fee (for example $75 U.S.) and a percentage of your royalties (perhaps 10-20%) for its services.
Make sure the publishing administrator has an existing working relationship with the PRO you are using, so that the process of collecting and distributing your royalties is streamlined.

, If you want to focus on publishing and disseminating your album through a particular online music service (such as iTunes, Google Play, etc.), you may be able to work directly with them. Once again, similar to a traditional publisher or a third-party publishing administrator, you will pay a fee and surrender a percentage of your royalties/revenues in return for having the administrative work done for you.


For example, the Google Play Artist Hub charges an initial fee and thirty percent of your revenues in return for global distribution of your album across the company’s various music platforms., Basically, if you are willing to spend the time to do the administrative work, you can become the publisher of your own album and collect one hundred percent of any royalties it earns. However, if administrative tasks are not your strong suit, or you simply prefer to focus your energies on creating and sharing your music, it may be worth the initial payments and royalty reductions to sign on with an existing publisher/administrator.

Copyright your album.,
Upload your music.,
Make CDs and sell or hand them out.",How to Publish Your Own Music Album3," Technically speaking, your music is copyrighted as soon as you create it. In practical terms, though, registering your copyright according to the procedures in the nation where you live and/or operate applies legal “teeth” to the copyright you possess.In the United States, for example, you can submit a digital or physical copy of your album to www.copyright.gov, pay the fee (currently $35), wait several months for processing, and receive a copyright registration that will protect the ownership of your musical creation in U.S. and many international courts of law.
Whether you’re working with a publisher, acting as your own publisher, or not using a publisher at all, register the copyright for your work. Protect your legal rights to your album.

, Just like registering your copyright, signing up with a PRO or utilizing a publisher (whether yourself or someone else) is not legally required. Instead, it is simply a better way to protect your rights and claim any money due to you by way of your album. If, for you, “publishing” simply means getting your album into the hands of listeners, you can upload your music to your chosen social media pages, personal websites, and so on.


If you’re an independent artist looking to distribute your album freely and start to make a name for yourself, this simpler approach might work; if you’re seeking to control dissemination and earnings, follow a more structured publishing approach.

, Once again, depending upon your definition and expectations, publishing can be as simple as making up a batch of CDs of your album and selling them (or giving them out) at a coffee shop, flea market, or other venue. This may be your easiest route if you’re a new, independent artist trying to spread the word locally.

Promote your music on Twitter.,
Promote your music on Facebook.,
Promote your music on Instagram.,
Promote your music through a website.,
Distribute your music online.",How to Promote Your Music2," Twitter is another excellent venue for getting in touch with your fans, promoting your content, and getting more people excited about your music. To promote your music on Twitter, you should actively update your timeline with new information about events, promotions, and album releases. Here are some other things to try as you promote your music on Twitter:


Live-tweet events. If you have a unique perspective on something, from your own concert to the Grammys, use the live-tweet to keep your fans engaged.
Provide links to your videos or music.
Master hashtags to get more people interested in your music.
Take engaging photos that catch your followers' eyes and make them want more.
Take the time to reply to your fans. Reply to them publicly and let everyone know how much you care about your fans and make them feel special for reaching out to you by sending them DMs with more content.
Use the Vine app to promote your music through videos. Celebrities from Paul McCartney to Enrique Iglesias are already using this App., The best way to promote your music on Facebook is to create a Facebook Fan Page. This will allow you to connect with your fans and to separate your personal life from your professional life. Use your Facebook page to give fans basic information about your music, to provide exclusive content, and to give information about upcoming releases, concerts, and anything else your fans would like to know about your music. Here are some other things to keep in mind as you promote your music on Facebook:Don't annoy your fans by reposting the same information many times over. Once should be enough.
Use ""likes"" as a gate to distribute content like videos and downloads. If a fan ""likes"" your link, then he can listen to more of your music.
Connect with your fans. Ask your fans for feedback, and take the time to respond to your fans' comments. This will make them feel more connected to you and your music.
Reach out to other artists on Facebook. If you know a more popular artist or an artist whose music has a similar but larger fanbase, ask if he can promote your music on his page; this will drive up your likes.
Create events. Use Facebook to create events that invite your fans to your latest concerts. Even if the venue has already created an event, this will help get the word out to more people.

, You can use Instagram to reach out to even more fans. You should sync your Instagram and Facebook profiles to reach out to more people at once, and use popular hashtags to increase your visibility. Work on posting images from your band rehearsal, or even the occasional photo of you or your band members goofing off to show that you're human.


Take the time to engage with your fans. If they post a photo of your concert, you should like the photo.
Post your content during weekday afternoons -- they tend to get more traffic that way.
You can get more likes on Instagram by liking your fans' photos or commenting on more photos.

, Though social media is an excellent platform for promoting your music, you must absolutely have your own website. This will help steer fans in the right direction in the most professional way possible. Your website should have information about your concerts, music, origin story, and anything else that can help get your fans more excited about your music.


Use social media to promote your website, and include a link to your website in all of your social media profiles.
You should pay for your own domain name and your own unique website instead of promoting your band on a site for many other bands if you want to stand out.

, Have your music readily available on Spotify, RadioAirplay, Deezer, Singrush, and iTunes. That way, you'll look like a real professional the next time a venue manager or fan asks where he can find your music.


Use audio drops when you distribute and promote your music. This means telling your listeners where they can find your music at the beginning or at the end of every single, or at the beginning and end of every album."

Build relationships in person.,
Create a killer press kit.,
Find a manager.,
Have as many concerts as you can.",How to Promote Your Music3," Any time you're out in the world, you have a chance to build a connection with someone in the music industry. You can start small, by following producers or artists online, and work your way to meeting them in person at concerts, small venues, or even social events (as long as you've been invited). Don't force it; just take the time to grow as an artist and to get to know as many people in the industry as you can.


Always be friendly and polite. You never know who could end up helping you.
Build relationships with fans as well. If a fan wants to interview you in-person or even online, say yes. This will help get your name out there, even if it's only to a few people.

, The press kit should generate interest in you as an artist and a musician. It contains you or your band's biography, fact sheet, or brochure, promotional photos, any positive press your music has received, three song demos, and contact information. Here are some things to keep in mind as you put your press kit together:Limit the amount of background information. Don't wear out your audience.
Keep the fact sheet basic. Provide information about your hometown, the names of your band members and the instruments they play, album release information, touring dates, recording studio, producers, and contact information for your management.
Your demo CD should be of high quality and professionally made -- do not burn a CD at home. Remember that you have 30 seconds at most to grab the listener's attention so make it count.
Include a gig sheet with information about future and past gigs. This will show that you have growing popularity and that you are a great investment.
Include a few professional 8 x 10 photos that are appropriate while showing what makes you special.

, A manager is a person who will advise you and your band in every aspect of your career. You should find a manager who has worked with other artists successfully and who has many connections in the music industry and a solid reputation to boot. Use a music industry print directory to reach out to a manager, and ask any connections in the music industry if they have any recommendations.Don't send along an unsolicited press kit. Instead, get in touch with a manager to see if you can send along your material. If it doesn't work out, you'll still make a connection in the process.

, Concerts are a great way to promote your music and to connect with your fans. Whether you're opening for Green Day or playing on a tiny stage at a local bar, use the concert to sell your brand and to sing your heart out. Take the time to connect with fans before and after the concert.


Fans love free stuff. Use your concert as an opportunity to give out free t-shirts, merchandise with your band's name on it, singles, and anything else that can help get the word out there.
If other bands are performing at the concert, talk to them to build more connections. Complement their work and if you hit it off, ask if they'd mind promoting your music.

This is an easy task on most websites, whereas eBay (for example) may be a bit trickier as there are various sellers instead of just one company offering a CD for sale. If you're unfamiliar with eBay, you may want to read this article or simply just search elsewhere.

, This is optional because you may not find it necessary, however, if you want a bargain then you can search other websites and compare the prices. Don't forget to look at shipping prices. Is the delivery free in your region or does it double the price that you would have to pay for the CD alone (e.g. CD is £4.99, shipping is £4.95)? Find a deal that's right for you.

, If not (you haven't received the CD), you may want to deal with it appropriately depending on the payment method you used and who you bought it from.

This is another helpful method which may just about work for shopping for music CD's.,
You might not want to travel too far so it may be best to start off by visiting a music store that is closer to you.,
Make a visit to the music store.,
If all else fails and they tell you that they don't stock it at all (and it's not on their website), you may want to search elsewhere.

",How to Shop for Music CDs3," You'll be able to find recently released material as well as CD's that were released 20 or more years ago. These CD's will all most likely be in mint condition and the fact that you can actually browse the stock means that you'll be able to spot any faults before you make a purchase. It may not however be an easier way of purchasing rarities.

, If you can, call the store in advance and ask if they have the CD that you want in stock, they may surprise you by saying that it is in stock and they may even tell you how many copies they have in stock too. However, they may also disappoint you by saying that it isn't in stock. You can simply ask them if they know when it will be back in stock and hope to purchase it then or simply look in other branches.

, Because it is a large business, there CD's should be arranged in alphabetical order as well as music genre and remember that larger stores means larger stock, which means that you'll have a greater chance of finding your CD.

Shopping for music CD's in a general music store that doesn't have any other branches may be a little more limited if you're looking for CD's that have been released recently.,
Before you head out, you may want to call your local store (or the store that you're planning to go to) to see if they have the CD that you want in stock.",How to Shop for Music CDs4," In stores like these, you're most likely to come across older and most likely used CD's too.

But some music stores are more dedicated than others and will make an effort to keep their displays tidy and in order. If you're in doubt or on the verge of frustration, ask someone who works there. They may be able to straight out tell if it's in stock or not. If it isn't, you may want to search elsewhere. If it is, they may also point it out for you. If you're just simply browsing with an open-mind, you may be surprised with the CD's that you come across.

This is something that you're more likely to do if you're just looking for music CDs to buy but you don't have any CD's in mind.,
Search the displays.,
If you're satisfied with the condition of the CD and you are definite that you want it.",How to Shop for Music CDs5," You may also choose to do this without worrying about how time-consuming it may be. Keep in mind that may find it virtually impossible to find a 'newly-released' album in a thrift store, but even if you do, go figure.

, Is there anything that appeals to you? If there is, take a good look at it. What's the condition that it's in? Is it rare? And does the price reflect these factors? If you feel that you may want to buy it. Look at it closer. You may not be allowed to do this in some stores but look inside the CD case. It's not impossible for people to open up the cases of used CD's in a thrift store only to see that's it's empty or that it's got the wrong CD in it. This is a result of people wanting to clear their houses of junk and take anything to thrift stores without taking time to think or inspect.

Be honest with yourself.,
Consider your influences.,
Make a mind-map.,
Determine what you want people to understand.",How to Write an Artist Statement1," Before you write a word, take some time to just think about you and your art. You need to understand what it is that you are trying to achieve, before you attempt to explain it to anyone else.


Ask yourself what you're doing. What does your art express? What makes your art unique?
Ask yourself why you're doing it. What motivates you to create art? What emotions or ideas are you trying to convey? What does your art mean to you?
Ask yourself how you're doing it. What do you draw inspiration from? What tools and materials do you use?;
, Think about the things that influence you, whether it's art, music, literature, history, politics or the environment. Think about how these influences have made an impression on you and how they manifest themselves in your work. Try to be as specific as possible.

, Mind-mapping is a good way to free your thinking. It will also help you to trace the relationship between different ideas.


Jot down a key idea that informs your work in the center of a blank page. Then spend 15 minutes writing down any words, phrases, feelings, techniques etc. related to that idea.
Free writing is another technique that can help get the creative juices going. Spend 5-10 minutes writing whatever pops into your head when you think about your art. You'll be amazed at what you come up with., Think about what you want people to take away from your art. What message or emotion are you trying to convey?

, An effective artist's statement reaches out and welcomes people to your art, no matter how little or how much they know about art to begin with; it never excludes. It should make your work more accessible, not obscure it with convoluted language filled with artsy jargon. Write in simple, straightforward, everyday language.

, Make sure that the triangle is not in danger of falling while being played.


If you are holding it with a string, keep your fingers in an ""O"" shape, allowing the string and triangle move freely.
Alternately, use a triangle holder. A triangle holder is a wooden or metal device that you can use to suspend the triangle.

, Whether you use a triangle holder or just your hand, make sure none of your skin is touching the metal of the triangle.


Contact between the triangle and your skin interferes and dampens the sound.

, In this position, you can see the triangle, your music, and the conductor if you are in a performance.


People in the audience will enjoy seeing your performance, so try to smile, especially if you have a triangle solo!

, Choose a beater that gives you the tone and percussive sound that you want for a specific piece.


You can choose thick wood and metal beaters, or progressively thinner cylinders of beaters, which will all give a dynamic range of tones.
Depending on the music piece, you may want to use more than one kind of beater in the piece, or even alternate beaters.

, You can strike the triangle in at least three places, depending on the sound you prefer.


You can strike it on the outside, nearer to the apex, on the inside at the bottom, or on the outside at the lower corner.
Keep the beater at a forty-five degree angle to the triangle's side, which produces the full range of lovely overtones.
There are a variety of ways to strike the triangle. See Reading and Playing Triangle Music, below.

, Depending on the length of the note, you'll need to dampen (or stop) the ringing tone.


Using the fingers not holding the beater(s), press the resonating side of the triangle with two fingers.

, A two-sided triangle roll is created by beating two adjacent sides of the triangle from the inside.


Take the beater and hit the top and bottom sides, or the two sides of the triangle, with an even but rapid back and forth motion.
Make sure to perform this action with an even, rhythmic motion.
For ""full"" sound, make sure the beater is at a forty-five degree angle when it hits the triangle.

, A three-sided triangle roll is created by beating all three sides once each in a rapid circular motion.


Take the beater and hit each of the three sides in the same order, very quickly, in a rhythmic pattern.

, Like other percussion instruments, the ability to do a roll both softly and loudly, and vice versa, but in rhythm, is an important skill.

, Music for the triangle is written on the percussion staff, often with triangular shaped notes, but is sometimes written with regular music notes.


Triangles don't have pitch, so the notes will appear on the same line.
Triangles do have rhythm, so the same note values apply, i.e. a whole note, half note and quarter note, eighth notes, etc.
Playing the triangle gets harder the shorter the notes are, so this is a really important skill to master.

, Being able to read triangle music well requires hitting the triangle with the correct force and rhythm consistently as marked within the music and/or by the conductor.

, In music, an accent is how strongly you hit the note, and for a triangle, you'll need to learn a strong accent (>), a medium accent (-), and a staccato accent (•).


A strong accent is created by hitting the triangle with the beater very hard and very fast.
A medium accent is created by hitting the triangle with the beater with moderate force, and very fast.
A staccato accent is created by hitting the triangle with moderate force and even more quickly and dampening the sound almost immediately after striking the triangle.

, Even though they are percussion instruments, playing a triangle often involves adjustments to the loudness or softness of the tone.


Increase force when striking the triangle, and perhaps even choose a different beater, to increase the loudness of the tone to strong (forte), or very strong (double forte), and then strongest (fortissimo).
Decrease force when striking the triangle, and perhaps even choose a different beater, to decrease the loudness to soft (piano), very soft (double piano), and then softest (pianissimo).

, Graces notes are notes played in a specific rhythm before the first note in a musical measure.


Playing grace notes on a triangle is easier if you suspend the triangle on a music stand with clips and play with two matched beaters.

Set up an online store.,
Promote your art through social media.,
Create a webpage.",How to Sell Original Artwork for Profit2," Sites like Etsy, DeviantArt, Artsy and Imagekind provide a perfect platform for making your art accessible to potential collectors all over the world. Just upload photos of your work, set prices for each item and use a separate program like PayPal to process payments. You can then handle all the financial transactions and shipping yourself.Curate your content by theme so that it will more visible to people hunting for art of a specific type.
E-commerce hubs like Big Cartel and Shopify might also be useful for selling your art online., If you haven’t already, sign up for a separate account for your art on Facebook, Instagram or Tumblr. Many modern artists have found success using social media to build a dedicated following. More likes and shares means more exposure, which can in turn lead to more sales.Include a link to your online store somewhere front and center in your bio to make it easier for users to purchase the pieces they’re browsing.
Spending a little extra money on sponsored posts will ensure that it reaches more eyes., As part of your online presence, it’s a good idea to give interested parties a dedicated place to find out more about what you do. That way, potential buyers can read up on you, explore your finished works and get in touch with you directly. A standalone website will attract the interest of people who don't use social media to keep up with emerging artists.Your website could be as sophisticated as an interactive portal that allows shoppers to preview slideshows of your work or as simple as a blog.
Make sure your contact info is displayed somewhere in plain sight, along with a mission statement and brief explanation of your style."
"
Market to your likely audience.,
Present your art yourself.,
Do commissioned work.,
Get your name out there.",How to Sell Original Artwork for Profit3," If you want to sell more art, it’s important to first have an understanding of who’s most inclined to buy it. Think about the dominant images or ideas contained in your work and what sort of views they reflect. Once you’ve identified your core fanbase, you can begin developing strategies that will allow you to bring your art to their attention more effectively.Modern pop art full of cultural references, for instance, is more likely to appeal to other artists and art aficionados, whereas traditional watercolor landscapes will be more popular with a general audience.
Advertise in places where your target demographic has the greatest chance of stumbling upon your work.

, Anytime you’re at an exhibition or event, stick close to your work so you’ll be available to answer questions and highlight interesting features. Being friendly and approachable will encourage people to take a closer look. In the best case, it may even give casual onlookers the push they need to add a piece to their personal collection.Being able to describe your creative process is instrumental in helping people better connect to your art.Be ready to explain the complex themes in your work and provide insight into your influences and favorite techniques.

, Commissions are the bread and butter of many professional artists. When a buyer hires you to produce a commission, it’s like signing a contract that guarantees you a paycheck. Approach each commission differently and work out a price you think is fair for the request.The best way to entice people to buy commissions is to advertise the option for custom artwork on your business card, exhibition display or website.
Commissioned work should take precedence over other pieces.
It’s a good idea to ask for a percentage of the payment up front in case the buyer tries to back out later on., All the exposure in the world won’t mean anything if no one knows who you are. Be sure to introduce yourself to everyone you meet, and remind them of your name before you part ways. You might even consider printing up some business cards that you can hand out at exhibitions and networking events.Come up with separate name for your studio or personal business, such as “The Rickety Easel” or “Ada’s Impressions.”Your business cards should include your first and last name, a brief overview of the type of art you create and a simple but eye-catching graphic that offers a glimpse of your signature style."
"
Make a complete walkthrough of the exhibit to get an overview of the show.,
Go back through the show, pausing to investigate those works that struck your fancy.,
Read wall labels as much or as little as you like.,
Take advantage of any work of art with few or no viewers in front of it.,
Skip those works that are crowded by viewers and return to them later when the crowd has moved on.

,
Sit before a work of art that interests you whenever a bench or other seating is available.,
Take one last look at your favorite pieces before you leave the show.

",How to View an Art Exhibit," Take note of works that particularly appeal to you, but keep moving on this initial tour.;
, Sometimes shows have an intended viewing sequence, which will help answer questions you might have about the show's meaning. Curators (people who pick the works, and help arrange them in a gallery) are always aware of the sequence with which you will view works, and definitely take in mind how the first works you see entering a space will inform your response to the whole show.

, These notes can help explain things, and often totally transform your response to the piece. Sometimes, just understanding what a work is made of can help form new understandings, for instance: it looks like thread, but it's really made of metal.

, View the art up close, and also from afar. Note how your distance from the work changes your perception of it.

,, Take time to savor the work, but never feel like you have to stare at something you don't like.

Build a social media presence.,
Start by selling through a third-party website.,
Price your work fairly.,
Take commissions.,
Pack carefully.,
Consider creating your own website.",How to Sell Paintings1," You’re probably already on at least one social media website. Furthermore, you have a basic idea about how they work. Social media can be used to make connections with others and display things you find beautiful. These qualities also make social media an excellent way to launch your career. Here are a few different websites you should consider using--they all work a little differently, so try more than one.


Facebook is a good way to stay connected to a wide demographic of fans. Make a fan page (separate from your personal account) and use it to talk about upcoming events and new pieces.Instagram is populated by a younger demographic. Because it’s so image-driven, it’s great to show off sketches, works-in-progress, and finished commissions.Twitter requires pithiness, but it’s surprisingly useful. Leverage your 140-character tweets to promote shows and connect with other artists.Tumblr allows you to post complete works, and is also a great way to build relationships with other artists (since a good Tumblr is comprised of a mix of original content and artwork you find beautiful).;
, Many artists start out their online sales not through a private page, but through an established website that features lots of up-and-coming artists. There are a few advantages to this: you don’t have to know how to code to get started, and many new buyers feel more comfortable shopping through a website with buyer protections in place. Here are a few well-known art vendors online.Artsy has been around for a while and encompasses a broad range of style.
If you have a particularly homespun or cute aesthetic to your work, Etsy is great.

Spreesy is a newer site that dovetails well with an Instagram presence.

, It can be really hard to figure out how to price your work: many new artists end up undercharging, which is simply not sustainable. Don’t sell yourself short--pick a pricing scheme for your pieces, and stick to it. Consistency is key! (And if you’re worried that you’re overcharging a tiny bit for the pieces that you sell, that’s often a sign that you’re charging about the right amount.)You can start by charging by the hour--for instance, if a painting took you ten hours to complete, you can value your time at $15/hour and charge $150 for it.
You can also charge by the linear inch; for instance, if a painting is 20 by 30 inches, and you charge $0.50 per linear inch, the total cost would be $300.
Don’t forget to factor in the cost of materials! Include finishing touches like frames in this calculation.

, If you’ve been building up an online presence and presenting a consistent artistic vision to your fans, someone will probably ask you for a custom work sooner or later. This is really exciting! Don’t get overwhelmed by the process of working with another person’s vision, but ask plenty of questions and offer frequent updates.


Make sure to send your portfolio to someone who inquires about a comission--they should feel like your style is a good match if you’re going to work together.For consistency’s sake, price commissions similarly to other paintings of the same size, materials, and time commitment.
Ask for a deposit of 25% or so before you begin the piece. This will protect you in case the buyer doesn’t like the finished product. In the unlikely event that the buyer refuses the painting, you can keep it and sell it to someone else later., Once you’ve made a sale online, you’ll have to ship out your work. Wrapping the painting in multiple layers of both hard and soft materials should keep it safe in transit, so that it gets to your customer as pristine as it left you.Start by wrapping the painting in palette wrap (an art supply that looks like plastic wrap). Start by holding the wrap in the back, then pull it around to the front, and then to the back again.
Align the long edge of the painting with a large piece of cardboard, and mark where the short sides rest. Now, flip over the painting along the long edge, so that it’s in the middle of the cardboard. Cut along the long edge so that you have a big cardboard rectangle. Wrap this around the painting, and secure it with packing tape.
Cover the cardboard-wrapped painting in one or two layers of bubble wrap. Secure the bubble wrap with packing rape.
Place the bubble-wrapped painting in a nice big box, then fill in gaps in the box with bubble wrap or packing peanuts.
Finish off by neatly addressing the box and decorating it with a few Fragile stickers.

, If you’ve been in the online game for a while, it may be time to take your sales to your own private webpage. This is a big step, and one perhaps best taken if you already have a solid customer base, but having your sales and portfolio all bound up under one domain name is professional and elegant.You can use basic coding knowledge to make your website.
Using a template service, like Squarespace or Weebly, also works if you don’t code.
Consider adding a blog to your website. This allows for longer-form thought than social media does, and can also be used to draw attention to upcoming events.Don’t forget to link to your social media and vendors.

Start local.,
Apply early and with care.,
Be professional.,
Bring decorations to go with your paintings.,
Be engaging.",How to Sell Paintings2," Fairs and conventions can be a great way to connect with new people and sell your artwork, but they can also be expensive. There’s the cost of your booth itself, along with travel expenses and time off of your day job (if you have one). Try to sell first at events close to your home, until you have a good grasp on what you need to do to succeed at a convention.

, Many conventions start booking their booths nearly a year in advance; you’ll want to stay on top of deadlines for your chosen events, and apply as early as possible. Most conventions have a set application, including a portfolio and an artist’s statement--this will help the organizers determine if you’re a good fit in genre and style.However, it’s just as important to know if the convention is a good fit for you. Before you apply, find out the answers to some of these important questions.


How much space is each booth allowed?
Is a chair included?
Will there be an outlet nearby?
Is the space accessible (especially if you have any mobility considerations)?

, When you go to a fair or convention, you’re not just there to hang out: you’re there to promote your artwork and your brand. Be kind to everyone, from guests to fellow artists to staff, don’t let your art spill over onto other people’s tables, and clean up after yourself.


Pack the artwork you bring carefully, and make sure to have extra packing supplies.
Bring business cards, too--this way, even if someone isn’t able to buy a painting today, they can refer back to you later..Pay for your booth or table at the convention on time; otherwise, your spot may go to someone else., Your paintings are what will hold most people’s attention, but you’ll need to catch their interest first. Decorate your booth in a way that matches your aesthetic and corresponds to your paintings to draw the eyes of potential customers.


Consider setting out small objects that correspond to your subjects (for instance, shells, if you like painting seascapes.)
Bring a nice solid-colored tablecloth to make an even, professional-looking workspace.A standing banner with your name, an art sample, and contact information on it can go almost anywhere, and commands attention without being too obnoxious., Now that you’re all set up, be friendly with the people who come by your table. Smile and say hi to browsers, and try to master the art of engaging in conversation without being too pushy. You can even consider doing quick commissions, like sketches or watercolors, for interested buyers.If you don't know what to say when someone is looking at your work, a smile and a simple ""Hi there!"" or ""Hello!"" works wonders.
It's easy to engage with buyers with sincere compliments (""I love your shoes!""), as well.

"
"
Use your network.,
Do a portfolio review.,
Consider consignment.,
Submit to galleries.",How to Sell Paintings3," Your professional network is probably bigger than you think it is, and many of the most fruitful business relationships have sprung from personal friendships and connections. If you’re looking to sell art in a brick-and-mortar shop or gallery, reach out to people you know who might be able to help. Introduce yourself, provide samples of your recent work, and ask for what you need.You can network in person, over the phone, or over email. Just be polite!If you're reaching out to your mother's old classmate, say ""Hi Judy, my mother told me a lot about your time together in college. I'm reaching out because she's mentioned your gallery before, and I think it might be a good fit with my work. Here's a link to my portfolio and website. Thank you so much for your time.""
Check in with old teachers and professors, too--they often have resources that could help you. Say ""I'm looking into pushing my career into a more professional stage, and I think exhibiting in a gallery could be the next step. Do you know of any places close by that specialize in young or emerging artists?""

, If you can afford it, a portfolio review can help you both focus your art, and sell it better. Generally, this involves paying a fee to a jury, all the members of whom will sit down with you and talk to you abut the coherence of your work and its marketability. This is a step to consider if you really want to take your painting business to the next level.Be polite to the folks giving you feedback! The art world is small, and you never know when you’re going to run into them again.
Don’t get too bogged down by criticism. No artist meets with universal acclaim, so just concentrate on improving by applying constructive criticism to your work.

, Look for stores or boutiques in your area who you think would want to carry your items, and reach out to ask if they might carry on consignment: this way, you pay them a portion of the profits if the item is sold. Consignment is excellent for three main reasons: you get publicity, you don't pay anything up front, and you don't pay rent on the building where they are selling your items., The last way to sell your paintings is arguably the one with the most professional appeal: through a gallery. A gallery is almost like a museum, in that it’s carefully curated and professionally staffed by art experts, except that the art on its walls is for sale. Apply widely--just like if you were applying for a job, you probably won’t hear back from every one, but each contact is valuable.


When submitting to a gallery, stick to the submission process it follows. You can find this information on the gallery’s website, but you’ll often be asked for samples and a statement (especially if the gallery has a theme).Submit groups of artwork with coherent ties to one another. For instance, you could submit a series, or several paintings you did at different times that all allude to Aztec mythology."

Choose a species for your fursona to be.,
Think of a design for your fursona, like the coat color and/or markings on it.,
Think of specific details that you would like this fursona to have.,
Decide the aspects of your fursona's personality.,
Think of a name for your fursona.",How to Make a Furry Persona (Fursona)," Do your research and figure out what animals you like most, or what animal you identify with. There are tons of animals out there to choose from, including reptiles of all kinds, avians (birds and anything with feathers), amphibians, horses, goats, skunks, and thousands of other species out there. Don't be afraid to venture out from the idea of just sticking to a cat or dog. You can even mix animals together, use a fantasy creature, or even make up your own. If you can't decide on just one, you're also free to make a hybrid, or have multiple fursonas.
, This can be as natural looking or as crazy as you want it to be. You could have anything from a simple grey-colored wolf to a turquoise phoenix to a yellow komodo dragon with red stripes and a black tail! Your fursona can also have tattoos, piercings, patches of different colored fur/feathers/scales/skin, even extra tails if you'd like! It's completely up to you., Do they wear clothing? Do they have anything interesting or noteworthy? Does your fursona have feral (quadrupedal) proportions, or is it more anthro, with human-like proportions? Come up with details like these when making your fursona.#* Sketch out what your animal looks like. This can help you decide on the certain character traits you want your fursona to have. If you can't draw too well, search up bases on FurAffinity or deviantART and color on them. (Just make sure to credit the base artist.), If you're only making this fursona to have a representation of yourself as an animal within the fandom, you're already done. If not, think about new traits for them, such as what they like and dislike, their good character traits and their downfalls. It may be tempting to create a perfect and cool character, but a fursona with both positive traits as well as shortcomings is more interesting and can be related to., This could be your own name or you can pick a name that you find interesting. Nobody can claim a fursona name, so don't feel pressured to make a ""unique"" name if you don't want to. If you're having trouble coming up with a name, feel free to search through baby name sites, think of words (or even words in other languages) that reflect something about your character or ask the community for help."

Determine how much time you want to spend in a venue in a single session.,
Determine what primary art mediums you are interested in: Painting, sculpture, oils, watercolors, modern, realism, representational, classical, and so on.,
To figure out which mediums you have an interest in, browse through art history books, magazines, and find out which ones look aesthetically pleasing.,
Most major cities have multiple venues for viewing art.,
On your first visit, get a map of the museum collection (from the front desk - they always have one) and become familiar with where things are.,
Take more time with the art work that especially interests you.,
Take some time to answer these questions.,
As you go through the museum, do you recognize any art from the art books you looked at to get ready for the visit?,
At the end of the tour, try to re-visualize what you saw.",How to Visit an Art Gallery," For example, all the works in the Philadelphia Art Museum can be casually and comfortably browsed in 2-3 hours. A local gallery store-front can be browsed in 5 or 10 minutes.;
, This will help you figure out which venues to visit.

, You might also find which time periods and movements you fancy as well.

, If you live in a place like New York, try the Metropolitan Art Museum in NYC for your first visit. This museum has one of the greatest variety of styles and artists and cover a wide range of art history. You can find all the venues in the Yellow Pages or museum and gallery directory, if you can find one. The Internet is also a great resource.

, Develop a plan of what order you will visit each gallery in the museum. Then finish off that floor and move up to the next floor, and so on.

, In fact, if you find some art that particularly pleases you, you might want to spend 10 or 20 minutes with it to absorb all the meaning. See it from a distance and as close as the guards will allow.

, See the brush strokes - how do they flow? Capture the overall design of the artwork. Does it seem to have sections? How about the colors? Are they spectacular or dull? If it is a portrait does it seem to send you a message? Sometimes in a painting a few red or orange specs of color make the painting very exciting. If it is a modern painting or sculpture can you tell the theme without looking at the nameplate? What shades of blue did the artist use? Some shades affect our circadian cycles and put us in a good frame of mind (perhaps to sleep).

, How does the real version compare?

, This will encourage your brain to remember.

Know what you're talking about.,
Be polite.,
Avoid speaking to tabloid journalists, or any other shady journalist.,
Do not downplay negative aspects of the fandom - talk about the issue you have with it.,
Use terms that everyone will know.",How to Present Furry Fandom to the Media," If you have a very narrow view of the fandom, then you won't exactly be able to be the best spokesperson for it.


A stock response to the media could be something along the lines of this: ""Furry is a subculture fixed on animal character design and how it can ram into someone's identity."" A longer, more involved run-down could read something like, ""Furry Fandom is all about animals that walk and talk as we do. It's based on mankind's millenia-old fascination with the animal kingdom and has its roots in the gods of Egypt, in the fables of Aesop, in the stories of Reynard the Fox, all the way into modern-day cartoons. Look at our how pervasive they are in our culture, in our advertising and our sports mascots. People have always admired animals. It's a trait that transcends all cultural and racial boundaries. Everyone the world over talks to his cat, and it's part of our basic psychological makeup to imagine that the cat actually gives a damn what we are saying. If the cat did give a damn, and in fact if he could argue the point with us, that is Furry Fandom.""Don't feel the need to memorize a paragraph though! When you're with media, be succinct in your responses.;
, Not only does this help present a positive image, it also dispels any suspicion that you have something to hide by running away from the journalist. If you do not want to talk to them, smile and politely inform them that you are not the right person to talk to, and then direct them to the organizer/media liaison of whatever gathering you are attending.

, These people are often even more focused on getting the juiciest story. Only talk to representatives from local stations and newspapers, or from a respectable network such as Discovery, or National Geographic.


If a reporter is from Comedy Central or G4, you need to be extra careful of what you say.

, If you are asked about a taboo subject, tell the media how you honestly feel about it. Is it unfair that you are being associated with yiffing? Or maybe the fandom really can be a place for some people to explore a kink, and people are being too sensitive over strange media coverage. The choice is yours. Obtain a clear opinion on how you feel about subjects like CSI, etc and talk about it in-front of the cameras if you're comfortable. If you're asked about sexual artwork, acknowledge that it exists, but also tell them that it exists in any fandom.

, Most people don't know what ""FA"", ""yiff"", ""scritch"", or any other furry terms mean. Instead, use terms like ""cartoon"", and names of well-known cartoon characters as examples. Terminology in a subculture is a large part of its soul, however, and conversation may give you a chance to expose popular terminology within the fandom. If you use one of our words to the camera, give the audience a heads up on what it means.

Pick a scale you feel comfortable with to start your challenge.,
Play down the scale as cleanly as possible.,
Play back up the scale to complete one rep. Guitarists must play down the scale just as often as they play up it, so don't consider one of your 100 reps done until you've made it cleanly back up the scale.,
Work your way up to 100 reps, playing as many as you can without pain.,
Dive into the 100 Scale Challenge at the end of your practice sessions.,
Add legato notes into your scales to improve speed and skills.,
Move your scale up and down the neck as you practice.,
Focus on keeping your muscles relaxed when you get tired.,
Use a metronome to help keep time and measure progress.,
Incorporate new scales, including scales you don't quite know yet, to grow as a lead guitarist.",How to Play the 100 Scale Challenge on Guitar," You can use any scale you want for this challenge, but it is best to start with something you already know how to use pretty well. Remember, this challenge is mostly to help your speed, strength, and stamina, so don't slow down your ""workout"" with a scale you have to keep looking up again. Some common scales to start with (all shown here in the key of A) include:










Minor Pentatonic Scale:

e|---------------------5-8-------------|
B|-----------------5-8-----------------
G|-------------5-7---------------------|
D|---------5-7-------------------------|
A|-----5-7-----------------------------|
E|-5-8---------------------------------|Major Scale:

e|---------------------------4-5-|
B|-----------------------5-7-----|
G|-----------------4-6-7---------|
D|-----------4-6-7---------------|
A|-----4-5-7---------------------|
E|-5-7---------------------------|



Minor Scale:

e|-----------------------------5-7-8-|
B|-----------------------5-6-8-------|
G|-----------------4-5-7-------------|
D|-------------5-7-------------------|
A|-------5-7-8-----------------------|
E|-5-7-8-----------------------------;
, You can play the notes any way you want, as long as you make sure you actually play them all cleanly and smoothly. Your focus must first be on clarity and technique, picking up speed only once you have the form down without mistakes.







, Again, focus on hitting all the notes so that they sound out crisp and clean, not dead, muted or missed.








, A little pain is to be expected, and many newbies will struggle to get through 100 scales when they first started. But, like a runner training for a marathon, you're not expected to get all 100 reps on your first attempt. Instead, play through your reps, working your way up every day. You might start with only 20-30 scales, but if you do this every day you'll be hitting 100 with ease before long.







, If you've got band practice, or a bunch of songs you need to learn for a show, don't tire yourself out before you get to the essentials. Moreover, waiting until you're already a little tired and warmed-up for the Challenge only pushes you further, helping you develop better stamina.









This is also a good ""mindless"" practice exercise. You can play it while watching TV for example, as long as you pay attention to hitting clean notes., You can pick every single note to work on strumming speed, or mix in some hammer-ons, pull-offs, and slides to move even faster through the scale. Like always, the most important thing is to play cleanly and smoothly -- speed doesn't mean anything if you miss half the notes.







, Notice how the frets get closer together as you move down the neck -- the exact movements of a scale near the head are going to be different than near the bridge. As you practice, slide down a fret every 10 runs through the scale. Make this as smooth as possible, trying to keep your rhythm consistent as you move from one spot to the other.








, After the first 20 reps or so, many players start to get tired. As a result, their form weakens, as they clench tired muscles and hold their breath. Remember to stay loose and take a short break to stretch or shake out your arms if you get too tired to continue.








Your elbow stays tucked towards your body.
Your wrist and forearms are relaxed and loose
Your fingers are not rigid and are close to the strings.
Remember to breathe. It may seem obvious, but many players hold their breath through difficult sections., A metronome is a great way to practice rhythm when you don't have other band members around to stay in time with. It also helps you gauge your skills, as you can work on raising the BPM of the machine every time you need to push yourself a little harder. Just make sure you always start at a BPM that you can play cleanly and without mistakes before upping the speed.








, As you speed begins to increase, keep challenge yourself with new shapes, scales, and locations on the neck. Each day, pick a new scale to work on, building your speed and strength over a variety of different patterns and fingerings.

In short, though, the furry fandom is a group of people of varying backgrounds that simply enjoy anthropomorphic animals (a good example would be the animals in Zootopia).;
, The group is centered around anthropomorphic animals, which are animals with human characteristics. Even if you simply enjoy the concept of werewolves, you may find your calling in this community. If you dislike anthropomorphic animals, think they're childish and silly, or don't like animals at all, you may not enjoy the furry community.

, There are many sub-groups within the furry fandom and you can probably find your own group of friends that have the same types of attitudes and interests as you. However, most of the community is supportive and interactive toward each other. There is a strong connection between most furries, as they all have a common interest that defines a lot of who they are as people.

, While some furries like to merge their sexual interests with the artwork and literature they create within the furry fandom, by no means does being a furry mean you have to enjoy the sexual side of the fandom. Many furries enjoy creating and participating in the fandom in a completely family-friendly way, and many who enjoy the sexual side often also enjoy PG furry artwork., If you want to create your own furry characters or enjoy wearing and roleplaying (in usually the most innocent of ways) in animal costumes like fursuits, your best bet will be to join the furry community. However, it is completely up to you if you want to join the community or not.

Even if you don't have a strong interest in anthropomorphic animals, if you want to join the community, the people within it will likely welcome you with open arms. On the same note, just because you like anthropomorphic animals a lot doesn't mean you are automatically a furry. That is completely up to you, and there is nothing forcing you to call yourself a furry or participate in the community.

, Creating one is technically optional but is recommended. Fursonas are fictional characters made to represent you.

, Many furries choose canines, felines, and dragons. However, you are not limited at all in your fursona species of choice. You can make birds, hybrids, and even made-up species such as Dutch Angel Dragons. If you want, you can even make your own. There are no rules at all when picking a fursona's species., The colors are completely up to you. It would benefit you to try your best to make the character look good. Bright, oversaturated neon colors can hurt people's eyes. However, feel free to design your fursona however you want. If neon colors are truly your thing, go for it. If you prefer completely natural colors, use them! Like with the species, there are no rules with colors and markings except..., If your character has a lot of similar unique features to another fursona, you should change them to something else. Fursonas are very close to people's hearts, and stealing them is not only unoriginal, but it can also get you in big trouble. It's okay to be inspired by other fursonas, but don't outright steal the character just because you like it., If you can't draw too well, consider paying another artist some money to draw your fursona. You can also use free-to-use bases by looking up ""Free base"" or ""Free lineart"" on deviantART or FurAffinity. These are free templates that you can color as a way to show others what your fursona looks like.

Don't just take images from the internet and say that it's your fursona. Those are other people's fursonas and often times, people have paid money to have those images drawn for them. It's considered art theft, and you can get in trouble for doing it!
Never claim to have drawn a free base. Always mention the person who made the base in the descriptions of the places you post it, and never say you drew it because you did not. You colored it, but an artist put time and effort into making the base for you to color.

, Most furry activity happens on the internet, and there are many websites to join within the furry community, like Furry Amino (mobile app) and FurAffinity. However, there are other places to hop into the furry community. /r/furry on Reddit is a very active subreddit and it is easy to start getting involved in discussions there. There are also many furry Discord servers, Skype groups, and Telegram groups for instant messaging. (There is a sizable list of them on /r/furry.), Tumblr, FurAffinity, and deviantART are great places to post artwork, literature, and other furry content. You can also talk to other furries on those sites and develop friendships over time with other furries that carry over onto other platforms., Many locales have their own furry groups. You can often look up ""Furries"" to find people near you who may be in the furry fandom. You can also check out the Globe feature on Furry Amino to find furries near you and start up a chat.

Be careful with meetups. Like with any community, meeting up with people online can be dangerous. Use common sense, and don't meet in secluded areas like their house or a hotel room. Many furries opt to meet up at conventions, as it is a safe environment to be in and you are free to fully express yourself in the con space.

, One of the best ways to get involved in the furry community is by attending furry conventions. The biggest furry convention in the world is Anthrocon, a US-based convention in Pittsburgh which had over 7,300 attendees in 2016. These conventions are fun places where furries can meet up, talk, socialize, and visit many events that happen there.

There are vendors that sell artwork, tails, accessories, badges, fursuits, and much more. In many conventions, there are also spectator-friendly fursuit games, fursuit dance competitions, fursuit floor wars, concerts, and many more special events that vary from convention to convention. Most top it off with a massive fursuit parade in which almost all of the fursuiters that attend the convention march along a path. Even if you don't have a suit, you can still watch all the fursuits march by. You can watch many of these events on YouTube if you are curious to see what happens during them.

, That is a wild misconception, and the fact is, less than a third of furries actually have fursuits at all, and not everyone even wants or likes fursuits. However, it is a staple of the fandom. They are very fun to most furries and are very entertaining for non-furries. If you want to get a fursuit, though, you'll need to save up quite a bit as the price tags on them usually start at $1,000 and up. ($2,000 and up for full-body suits!)

If you don't want to get a fursuit, you can skip this part, but if you are interested in getting a fursuit, read on!

, Fursuiters usually put a lot of time and energy into making their fursuited character come to life. They give their character personality, and the whole time they're in their fursuit is a performance. There are many panels you can watch about that teach you how to act in fursuit. You can look up ""Fursuiting 101"" and find many panels that walk you through the basics of performing in costume., These suits are a luxury and should not be put before your needs for food, water, hygiene, and shelter. Put aside money to save for a fursuit, but if you are in a financial crisis, your health and living conditions are much more important than a fursuit. You do not need a fursuit!, If you're only planning to wear your suit at conventions, at furry parties, or in an otherwise secure place, this may not be important for you. However, if you are planning to fursuit in public where most people aren't familiar with fursuits/fursuiters, you will most definitely need a handler.

You will need someone in real life who can help you out when fursuiting. There needs to be someone with you at all times when fursuiting who can help you watch out for problem people (rough teenagers and dirty or rowdy kids especially!) and can speak for you if you are a silent fursuiter. These people will be your eyes and ears as your senses are very muffled in fursuit, and will help you get out of problem situations and aid you in getting to a private area if you are overheating. Heatstroke is very dangerous, and nobody really likes it.

,


Partial Fursuits: These are fursuits that come with a head, hands, feet, and a tail. They are minimal and are meant to be worn with clothes to make it appear that the character is the one wearing the clothes. These are great for people who overheat easily, as they are easy to take off, are much more insulated considering there is less fur covering you, and have no extra padding.

Plantigrade fursuit: These costumes cover your full body. They are easier to overheat in and harder to get out of, but they show off all the markings of your character and make the suit look more like a character. The feet are flat, with the ankle being angled 90-degrees (like a regular human foot).

Digitigrade fursuit: These costumes cover your full body, but also have extra padding on the legs to make them look more animal-like. When done well, these suits can completely pull off the illusion of actually being a character, and make the character really come to life. Digitigrade feet resemble animal feet (they look like an animal's back legs when it's standing).

, If you only have one character, this part will be easy, but if you have multiple ones, spend time deciding which one you want to get as a fursuit. Make sure it is a character you enjoy and that you think would look good as a costume.

Make sure that character has at least a 3-view reference sheet either drawn by you, colored on a base, or commissioned by a reference sheet artist. It's extremely rare for fursuit makers to make you a fursuit without a reference sheet.

, There are hundreds of fursuit makers to choose from, each with their own style. You can find a large portion of them on the Makers Database.

Keep in mind whether or not the makers are open. Fursuit makers often only open 1-4 times a year, and when they do, they do not accept every order. Turnaround time for fursuit makers is usually a few months, so don't expect a fursuit to be shipped to you within a few days of ordering it.
Also, keep in mind their prices and terms of service. Many makers do not work with people under the age of 18, and most require a 30% down payment up front. (Not all of them require that, so check their websites!) Read through and understand what you are signing up for when you plan to commission them.
Decide on other options for makers. If you love a certain maker's work, but they haven't made a single fursuit in a year or two and look inactive, you may have a hard time commissioning them. Look through the Makers Database to find other options in case your first choice doesn't quite work out.
Check the maker's reviews (if they have any) on FursuitReview.com to get an idea of who you're dealing with. A few makers are great at making fursuits but have bad communication and miss details on characters. It's better to know this before you decide to commission them than after.

, Make sure the maker is open for commissions, then follow their instructions on their website to commission them. Make sure you are financially able to pay them and have read through their terms first.

The process is slightly different depending on the maker, but for most, you'll have to submit your character reference sheet and the details of what kind of suit you want through a form on their website.
Don't get upset if you don't hear back or weren't picked. Fursuit makers often get many commission requests, so they can't take every single one. Just wait for the next opening or wait for another maker to open.

, There's a place for every interest in the furry fandom. Artists, musicians, authors, dancers, comedians, actors, and many other creative people come together to celebrate animal anthropomorphism. Find some things you enjoy within the furry community and either start up that hobby or learn more about it., This can sound like a daunting task, but furries can often be some of the easiest people to talk to and make friends with. Furries who comment on your posts or whose posts you comment on and furries with similar specific interests as you are some types of people you can start making friends with. Sometimes, a furry is open to simply chatting with you randomly, and over time you may develop a friendship. The more active you are in the community, the more friends you will make., While you don't need to like every popular furry out there, it helps to at least know a few of the more well-known members of the fandom such as Uncle Kage (President of Anthrocon) and Ino/Telephone (founder of Dutch Angel Dragons and an actor). You can search for great artists within the fandom of all types and find people who inspire you., No matter what creative work you do, spreading the love by offering requests and/or art trades can help people get to know you and your work.

Opening for requests means you are allowing people to ask you for free creative work. Users may send you an image or written description of their character for you to draw or give a premise for a story. You're free to accept or deny requests, and you should not feel obligated to complete them, as they are free gifts.
Opening for trades means someone can ask you for a request, and in return, you can ask them for a request. There is a mutual agreement that each party will make something for the other. Unlike requests, you are obligated to complete a trade since they are giving you something with the expectation of getting something in return and vice versa. Do not accept a trade without doing your part.

, This means that you are offering to sell your work to others. Someone can give you money (either a set price or on a price quote basis) for something you made for them. Once you develop your skill, you can even make a living off selling your work exclusively within the furry fandom. Your work is great for both you as a content creator and the people commissioning you. Be warned that there are complete obligations, and you can get in legal trouble if you do not finish a commission - by accepting payment and not finishing, you are unintentionally scamming someone.

Set up a price page. You can ask other furries for help in pricing your work if you're not sure how much it should cost. Take into consideration how long you spend on each piece, and specify different styles. For example, a bust icon of someone's fursona with no shading would cost much less than a full-body drawing with lighting and shading.
Set up an info page. This will let them know if they are allowed to request changes after the commission is done, if the commission may be streamed, if you have refund policies, whether they pay before or after, and any other important information about your commissions.
Inform others about your commissions. You can post on Furry Amino, leave a link to your price page on your profile, and mention them in furry chats that allow advertising.

Add a closure if you have not yet already.",How to Make a Cape1," Great fabric choices include: cotton, flannel, satin, and wool.You will need fabric for the main, outer part of your cape, and a lighter fabric for the lining. They can be matching colors and patterns, or contrasting ones.


Consider using a pattern for one side and a solid color for the other.
You can use cotton for both sides of the cape since it is light enough.;
, Measure around the base of your neck. Next, measure down from your shoulder down to where you want the cape to end. Record both of your measurements.For something more cloak-like, measure down to your ankles or mid-calves.
For something more like a caplet, measure down to just past your elbows.

, Use a calculator to divide your neck measurement by 2. Divide the answer by pi or 3.14. Round the measurement up to the nearest quarter inch (half centimeter). This is your radius., Begin by folding the fabric in half widthwise. Fold it in half again, also widthwise, to form a square. Rotate the fabric so that the folded corner is in the upper left-hand corner.Don't fold the lining fabric just yet., Pin a piece of string to the top-left corner of your fabric, where the folds are. Tie a dressmaker's chalk or pen to the string so that it's the same length as your neck radius. Use the chalk/pen like a compass to draw an arch from the top edge of the fabric over to the left side edge., Add your radius measurement to your desired length measurement. Lengthen the string according to that new measurement. Draw a second arch to make the bottom of your cape., When you are done, fold your lining fabric into fourths, then place your cut fabric on top. Cut your lining using the cut outer fabric as a guide., Unfold your outer and lining pieces and stack them together. Fold them in half widthwise so that you get a semi-circle. Cut along the left folded edge; leave the other one alone. This will create the opening of your cape.

Save a step and stack your fabric together with the right sides facing in.

, Unfold your fabric semi-circles. Stack them together, right sides facing in. Make sure that all of the edges are aligned, then start pinning them together., Cut two 30-inch (76.2-centimeter) long pieces of ribbon. Unpin your cape at the top two corners to either side of the opening. Tuck the ribbons into the cape. Make sure that the ends are aligned with the edges of the cape, then pin them shut. The ribbons should be sandwiched between both layers of fabric.Give your ribbons a nicer finish by sealing the ends with a flame first.
Choose a wide ribbon that coordinates with your cape. Something around 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) wide would be ideal.
If you don't want a ribbon closure, skip this step.

, You want to sew along the inside collar, bottom edge, and the two straight edges. Leave a 4-inch (10.16-centimeter) gap along the bottom of one straight edge for turning.Make you sewing stronger by backstitching at the start and end.


If you added a ribbon closure, be careful not to sew across the ribbons!

, Cut some notches into the collar, about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) apart. Cut some slits into the bottom curve, about 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) apart. At the end, clip the top and bottom corners of your opening. This will help the cape lay smoother.

Try to cut as close to the stitching as you can without actually cutting through it.

, Use something blunt but pointy, such as a knitting needle, to help fill out the corners. Tuck the raw edges of your turning gap in until they match up with the rest of the cape, and pin them in place. Iron your cape flat., You can do this by hand using a ladder stitch. You can also topstitch all the way around the cape using a matching thread color and a ⅛-inch (0.32-centimeter) seam allowance. Remove the pins when you are done., You can stitch in a clasp-style close, a hook-and-eye-closure, or even a corded frog closure. Choose one that matches the style of your cape the best.

If you added a ribbon closure, skip this step.

Sew two gathering stitches along the top of your cape.,
Gather the top of your cape until it fits the hood.,
Sew the hood to the cape.,
Add a clasp or closure.,
Add some finishing touches, if desired.",How to Make a Cape2," You will need at least 1½ yards (1.4 meters) of fabric. Something cozy, like wool felt, fleece, or flannel, would work best. Keep the fabric folded as it came on the bolt.

If you want a longer cape, buy more fabric, but be sure to subtract 24 inches (60.96 centimeters) for the hood and seam allowances.

, Measure 22 inches (55.88 centimeters) from one of the narrow ends. Cut off the 22-inch (55.88-centimeter) wide rectangle. This will eventually become your hood. Save the big piece for later., Take the 22-inch (55.88-centimeter) rectangle you just cut off from your main piece. Turn it so that the folded edge is facing you. Cut it down so that it is 17 inches (43.18 centimeters) tall and 22 inches (55.88 centimeters) wide. Make sure that the 22-inch (55.88-centimeter) edge is along the fold. Discard the little scrap from the top., The big rectangle that's left over will make the main part of your cape. Measure the fabric along the folded edge. If it is too long for your liking, cut it down so that it's the right length. Remember to add 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) for seam allowances., Unfold the cape and turn it so that the wrong sides are facing you. Fold one of the long edges down by ½-inch (1.27-centimeter), and press it flat with an iron. Fold it by another ½-inch (1.27-centimeter), and press it flat again. Topstitch the hem down, ⅛-inch (0.32-centimeter) from the inside fold. Repeat this step for the two side edges.Backstitch at the start and end of your sewing to make your stitches stronger.

, Unfold your hood first, and turn it so that the wrong side is facing you. Hem one of the 34-inch (86.36-centimeter) edges the same way you did the cape body. Leave the other three edges alone.The 34-inch (86.36-centimeter) edge is the side that was 17 inches (43.18 centimeters) when folded.
Remember to backstitch at the start and end of your sewing.

, Fold the hood back in half again, with the wrong side facing out. The 22-inch (55.88-centimeter) edge should be back along the fold, and one of the 17-inch (43.18-centimeter) edges should be hemmed. Sew the other 17-inch (43.18-centimeter) edge using a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance.Remember to backstitch at the start and end of your sewing.
If your fabric is fraying a lot, you will need to go over the seams using a serger or zigzag stitch.

, Sew straight or basting stitches along the top, raw edge of your cape. The first one needs to be ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) from the raw edge, and the second one needs to be ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) from the raw edge., Find the bobbin threads on one side of your cape. Grab both of them, then start tugging on them. Keep gathering the fabric until it is the same width as your hood base, about 20 inches (50.8 centimeters). Tie off the threads, then snip the excess off.You can gather the fabric from both sides of your cape, but make sure that you are only pulling the bobbin threads.
When you are done, take the time to adjust the gathers so that they are even.

, Pin the hood and the cape together, right sides touching. Make sure that the raw edge of the hood is aligned with the gathered edge of the cape. Sew the two together using a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) seam allowance. Make sure that the gathered edges don't fold or bunch up while you sew.Remember to backstitch at the start and end of your sewing.
If your fabric frays a lot, you can go over the raw edge with a serger or zigzag stitch. You can also bind the seam with bias tape or hem tape instead.

, Here is where you can get creative. You can hand-stitch a simple frog closure to the front of your cape. You can also sew on two pieces of ribbons instead, if you prefer to tie the cape shut. Another option would be to add a looped cord on one side of the opening, and a large button on the other., You can consider your cape finished at this point, or you can add some embellishments to make it fancier.Here are some ideas to get you started:

Add a beaded fringe along the bottom for a gypsy cape.
Iron appliques to added design.
Sew on a fake fur trim to the hood fo a cozy cape.
Add some embroidery to the edges of your cape to make it fancier.

Fold the fabric in half lengthwise.,
Draw your side edge.,
Use a plate or bowl to trace your collar.,
Cut along the lines that you drew.,
Add some Velcro closures.,
Consider adding a superhero emblem appliqué.",How to Make a Cape3," Since you won't be sewing this, it would be best to use a fabric that does not fray, such as felt or flannel. You will need about 1 yard (0.91 meters) of fabric for this.You can use this method to create an adult-sized cape too, but you will need to use larger measurements.

, Orient the rectangle vertically with one of the narrow edges pointing towards you., Use a dressmaker's chalk or pen to make a mark along the bottom edge, 11 inches (27.94 centimeters) from the fold. How far down you make it is up to you; the further down it is, the longer the cape will be. Make another mark along the top edge, 5½ inches (13.97 centimeters) from the fold. Connect the lines using a straight edge.If you want a wider cape, and if you have enough fabric, you can make the bottom mark further from the folded edge.
For a more accurate length, add 5½ inches (13.97 centimeters) to your cape length. This will account for the neck opening.

, Find an 8-inch (20.32-centimeter) place or bowl. Place it along the top corner of your folded cloak. The side edge of the plate/bowl should be 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) from the fold. The bottom edge of the plate/bowl should be 5½ inches (13.97 centimeters) down from the top of your fabric. Trace the plate/bowl using a dressmaker's chalk or pen., Try to cut just inside the lines. This way, they won't show on your finished cape. You can leave your cap as is, or try one of the variations below for more character:

Round the top and bottom corners of your cape for a nicer touch.Add scalloped edge to the bottom of your cape.This is great if your kid wants to be Batman.
Cut notches and slits into the bottom edge for a battle-won cape.

, Get some Velcro squares or cut your own. Secure them to the top two ""fingers"" of your cape with hot glue or fabric glue. One goes on the top side, and the other goes on the underside.You can also use self-adhesive Velcro., Iron some fusible web interfacing to a piece of contrasting fabric. Draw and cut out your superhero's emblem. Pin the emblem to the back of the cape. Iron it down, then remove the pins.

Each fusible web interfacing will be a little different, so be sure to follow the instruction on yours closely.
Alternatively, you can cut the emblem out of felt and glue it to the back of the cape with hot glue or fabric glue."

Choose your fabric.,
Cut the fabric to length.,
Make the casing.,
Cut a piece of ribbon that's just a little longer than the casing.,
Pull the ribbon through the casing.,
Scrunch the cape to gather it.,
Trim the ribbon down to make the closure.,
Add Velcro closures to the ribbon.,
Add the finishing touches.",How to Make a Cape4," Since you won't be doing any sewing for this, you want to find a fabric that does not fray, such as felt or flannel. Jersey/t-shirt fabric and tulle also make great choices.


This will create a child-sized cape. You can use larger measurements to make an adult cape.

, Measure down from your child's neck down to where you want the cape to end. Add 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 centimeters) to your measurement. Cut the fabric according to that measurement.The cape can be as wide as you want it to be.

, Turn the fabric so that the wrong side is facing you. Fold the top edge down by 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 centimeters) to make the casing. Secure the bottom edge with fabric glue or iron-on hem tape.Hot glue is not recommended for this because it is not flexible enough to gather.
If you do know how to sew, you can sew the casing down, ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) from the bottom edge.

, It can be the same color as the cape, or a contrasting one. Something between 1 and 2 inches (2.54 and 5.08 centimeters) would work best.

If you want to tie the ribbon into a bow, cut it twice the length as the casing. You can also use a piece of silver or gold cording instead.

, Secure a safety pin to one end of the ribbon. Use the safety pin to pull the ribbon through the casing., Slide the cape so that it is centered on the ribbon. Next, scrunch the cape on the ribbon so that it gathers. It should be about half the width it used to be., Cut the ribbon down to 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) on each side. Seal the ends with a lighter to keep them from fraying.

If you will be tying the ribbon into a bow, skip this step.

, Place one Velcro closure on the front of one ribbon, and the other on the back of the other ribbon. Self-adhesive Velcro would work best. If you can't find any, you can glue on the regular kind with hot glue or fabric glue.

Consider hot gluing some pretty rhinestones over the front of one ribbon to make it fancier.
If you left the ribbon long, cut the ends at angles, then seal them with a lighter.
If you used cording instead of a ribbon, tie a knot into each end of the cord to keep it from fraying.

, You can leave your cape as is, or you can add some finishing touches, such as rhinestones or paint. Use colors that go well with your cape, and remember, less is more. Here are some ideas to get you started:Paint on designs using fabric glue or puff paint. You can free-hand them or use fabric stencils.
Use iron-on transfers to add designs to your cape.
Glue rhinestones along the edges using fabric glue or hot glue.
Use fusible web interfacing to glue appliqués onto the cape.
Hot glue a feather boa to the bottom of the cape.

, Attach large yellow pom poms to the top of the pipe cleaners with superglue., It will give them extra bounce when you move.

, Grasp the top of the triangle with one hand and the bottom of the base with the other hand. Pull them apart as wide as you can to make two oblong wing shapes.

, Set them in a Y shape on the floor and twist the hooks around each other in the center.

, Yellow pantyhose will also work, but it’s harder to find.

, If your pantyhose stretches fairly well without breaking, you can use one leg for each wing and let the top of the pantyhose connect over the center section. If you can’t, use one pair for each wing and cut off excess hose.

, Sprinkle glitter on them while it is wet for an extra shine., Wrap one strap around your arm and pin it behind the center part of the wing. Repeat with the opposite side.


Ask a friend to help you secure your elastic straps with safety pins.
The straps should feel very secure when they are looped over your arms.

, The straps should be sturdy enough to be taken on and off continuously if they are hand sewn around the metal divider.

There are numerous ways to curl your hair. For a long-lasting curl, use a curling iron or foam hair rollers. A curling iron works on most hair textures, but women with especially fine hair may need to use rollers in order to get a lasting wave.






You could also add a wave to your hair using braids. Braid your hair into multiple pigtails and wear the braids overnight, or at least for several hours before the event. Unravel the braids and comb them lightly to separate them into waves. The more braids you use, the wavier your hair will be.






Create beach waves by applying a thorough coating of hair gel to your hair. Working in sections, push the tips of your hair to the base of your head, allowing the hair to fold on itself as you work. The gel will continue to look wet even after it dries, but it will hold waves for a few hours. Spray hair with green hairspray.






Note that if you have short hair or would like an easier option, you could also buy a green wig with a long, wavy hairstyle.





;
, Bind the rubber snakes to the wig with green craft wire and hot melt glue.Place one snake across the wig, letting the head fall to the side. Keep the snake's body looking ""wavy"" rather than straightening it out. Tie it in place by wrapping wire around it.
Attach another snake to the wig, arranging its head to face in the opposite direction.
Tie the remaining large snakes to the wig by punching holes into the wig and gluing them in place, also using more wire. Arrange the snakes so that they are balanced on both sides of your head but not perfectly symmetrical.

, Arrange the attached snakes as necessary so that they are not falling in front of your face.


Note that you may need to hold the snakes in place by tying them to your head with wire.

, If your head is not already overwhelmed by rubber snakes, tie a few more snakes directly to your wig by twisting wire around the small snakes and locks of your wig hair.


Hide the wire underneath your hair, if possible.

, Make any necessary adjustments to the curls and snakes in your hair, holding them in place using hairspray, wire, and hot glue as needed.

, Create many small braided ponytails, using all your hair.


You should aim for at least 10 to 12 braids, but the more braids you have, the better.
If you have short hair, you can add hair extensions or use a wig. You could also use a wig if you have long hair but want something that will be easier to work with. Simply braid and work with the wig before placing it on your head.
Tie each braid off with a small elastic or rubber band.

, The simplest option is to leave your hair down, but for a more elegant look, you can also pin your braids into a bun at the top of your head.

For a more traditional, snake-covered style, leave your hair down.






For something a little more classy and subdued, wrap the braids into a bun and pin it to the top of your head.







, Wrap small rubber snakes in between your braids, tying them in place with additional elastic bands when needed.

If wearing your hair down, wrap one to three snakes around each braid.If you have a smaller number of braids, go for three snakes per braid. If you have a large number of braids, stick with one snake per braid. Weave the snakes in between the braids and tie them loosely in place with the elastics. Make sure that some are looking up toward the top of your head while others are hanging their heads down.






If wearing your hair up, weave anywhere from four to six snakes into the braids.Some snakes should face outward while others should hang down. Secure dangling snakes in place by tying a thread to a bobby pin and poking that thread into the snake with a sewing needle. Slide the pin into your hair and adjust as needed to hold the snake.







, For the simplest approach, buy a Greek goddess costume from the store or wear a Greek-inspired white dress.


A Grecian-style dress is traditionally very long, straight and column-like, but it is made from fabric that drapes well and appears very “flowy”. The dress may come over both shoulders or over one shoulder, and it may or may not have sleeves. It usually has some sort of band across the waist.
For a more modern, attractive twist, opt for a one-shoulder dress made of draping, flowing fabric that stops just above the knee.,


Fold a white sheet or large piece of material in half. The width should be a little less than twice the length of your arm span, and the length of the material should be equal to your height plus 18 inches (46 cm). Fold it in half so that it reaches from elbow to elbow.
Fold the top 18 inches (46 cm) over.
Wrap the fabric around you. The folded portion should be just below your arms, and one side should be open.
Fasten the fabric at your shoulders. Bring up enough of the fabric on both sides so that it overlaps on each shoulder. Hold it in place by knotting it or by fastening it with decorative brooches or safety pins.
Fasten together the open side. Bring the material together so that it overlaps, and hold it in place with safety pins or by knotting it in several places along the side. If desired, you could also tack it in place with a needle and thread.
Tie a belt around your waist. You can either use a white sash or a decorative gold metal belt. Pull extra material up so that it hangs gently and loosely over the belt.

, The ancient Greek chiton was worn by men and women, and it could be short or long.


Use white material, like a sheet, that is twice the length of your arm span and equal to your height. For a shorter chiton, use material that is a little shorter than your height.
Fold the material in half. Fold the width of the material in half so that it extends from fingertip to fingertip. Do not alter the height.
Sew along the open seam at your side. Turn the fabric inside-out and use a straight stitch or backstitch to create a sturdy seam along the open side of the garment. Then turn the fabric right-side-out again.
Slip it on and secure the open top. While the top is still open, the garment should fall just below your arms. Leave enough of a gap for your arms and head to fit through, but join the rest of the top edge together with brooches, safety pins, or knots. You could also tack the top edge together with a needle and thread at various points.
The points at which the top edge come together should be connected to each other by draping arches of fabric, revealing the skin of your shoulders and arms in between each spot. Do not overlap the fabric into a single straight, solid line over your arms.
Tie a belt around your waist. Use a white sash or gold metal belt. Pull a little extra material over the belt so that it hangs over slightly.

, You can use heavy make-up for this outfit, covering your entire face with thick coats of gray and green greasepaint. Apply large black circles around your eyes, insert yellow fright-contact lenses, and stage blood to your mouth.


Keep in mind that Medusa should be as beautiful as she is horrifying. Apply make-up so that it looks freaky, scary, and very morbid.
Use green foundation, As one who lived in relative darkness, Medusa would not have had bronze skin or rosy cheeks. Instead, she would have been fairly pale, with cracked skin that is peeling from her face.
Draw attention to your eyes by applying more heavy black eyeliner and black mascara. You can use dark eyeshadow to make your eyes look gaunt, or you could use a bolder metallic shade of green or purple for something a little more subdued and crazy.
Use either black lipstick or red lipstick. Go for black lipstick if you want something spooky. To emphasize the more alluring aspect of Medusa, use bright red or deep red lipstick. Apply tooth black out to make your teeth look authentic and decayed.

, Use facial paint to draw small scales around the top of your forehead, the edges of your face, and along the sides of your hands and feet.


You could also use black or green eyeliner to draw the scales, or for 3D effect, cut scales from colored construction paper, and apply with water and flour mixture, or cellophane tape.
Note that this is strictly optional. Even without the use of scales, you should still clearly resemble Medusa.

, You could wear a large rubber snake around your shoulders or waist, or weave a smaller one around your fingers.


Hold a rubber snake in each hand, or glue using skin-adhesive squares.
If wrapping a large snake around you, make it large enough so that it coils around you without needing to be held in place.

, Flat, gold or beige sandals work best. Paint all exposed skin with green tempera paint (non-toxic).

, Antique-looking earrings, bracelets, or brooches can be worn, but don't worry about getting too fancy or too gaudy because the Medusa was a hedonistic demon.

Add glitter, if desired.",How to Face Paint a Butterfly," You already know that a butterfly design will take your appearance to the next level, but a paintbrush and face paint won't save you if you make a mistake! Make sure you have a cloth on hand to clean errors, but your list of supplies should also include:









Container (for water)
Cotton cloth (for removing smudges and errors)
Cotton swab/Q-tip (for tidying edges and lines)
Glitter (optional)
Paintbrushes
Water-based face paints;
, Create an arch over one eyebrow, starting at the top of your nose. From there you should trace a steady line above your eyebrow, finishing the line at your temple.








Repeat this process for both eyebrows until you have made a shape similar to the top of a heart. Do not connect this line; you should leave a small gap between your arches.

, You don't have to worry if the lines look thick. As long as these lines are roughly the same height and width, your butterfly look will turn out looking great!









If your lines haven't come out quite as neatly as you wanted, damp your cloth and wipe any errors free. Then you can dry the skin with a separate cloth and start from scratch.
For fine lines or to correct detail work, a damp cotton swab/Q-tip will be more precise., The expressions that naturally occur on your face can wrinkle skin and affect your butterfly design. To make sure the design is consistent no matter your expression, ask your client to raise their brow and even out your lines.








, You'll want to start just below the beginning of your upper arch. Join it to the outside edge of the upper arch, and do the same with the other side of your face.








Butterflies are symmetrical, so take your time and apply your face paint so that each side looks the same.

, You don't worry about the thickness of your lines, but the contours under the eye can be difficult to paint evenly.To help you achieve an even look that isn't negatively affected by facial expression, ask your client to smile.








, You should do this by painting a sweeping crescent shape with your brush. Starting at the nose, go across the cheek and finally connect your line with that of the top wing.Then, do the same for the other side.








, Select a slightly larger brush and load it up with pink paint, or choose another color that matches your color scheme. Fill in one of the lower wings with paint and blend the edges in with your brush as you go.









Mirror both the colors and the patter of your first side on the opposite side.

, Sticking with your medium sized brush, rinse it and load it with the color of your preference. Paint arcs of this color under each eye, and also the eyebrow area.









By following the natural contours of your face, you will likely be able to make more symmetrical lines that imitates the natural markings of a butterfly.
Try not to add too many colors to your design. Too many colors that are improperly blended and/or defined can leave design looking less than professional., Wash your brush again and dip it into a different color. You should add this paint in small lines just below the new color you added on the eyebrow and under the eye.








, A high contrast color, like white or black, is especially good for giving definition to your outline. Using a fine brush, create a frilled edge around the outside of the butterfly wings. This does not have to be perfectly symmetrical, but it should be consistent around your entire design.









To help maintain consistency, break the larger outline into smaller shapes, like tiny C's. Connecting one end of a C to the next in your series and keeping these roughly the same size will keep your outline balanced.

, Using a dark colored paint, like purple, brown, or black, load up your larger paint brush. Paint the body by placing the brush at the top of the nose, then paint downwards to end at the tip.









You do not need to pain the entire nose for this effect.Start with a light line and add paint as you feel necessary. You can always add more pain to the body, but too much might have to be removed completely with your cotton cloth.

, These can be big and majestic or cute and stubby. While painting this feature, it can help to follow the arch made by the shape of the top wings.








, If you chose to paint your body with black paint, the body of your design likely won't need additional black paint for definition. Other colors, like brown or purple, can be more clearly offset from the rest of your design with a fine brush dipped in black pain.









Follow the outside edge of the butterfly body with a fine outline of black.

, If you notice any features that blend together too much, you can offset these with a thin line of black along the boundary shared by each color.









High contrast colors, like black and white, are ideal for adding emphasis to and highlighting face paint designs.
Detail work should be done with a light hand. Too much paint might ruin your design, in which case you'll have to wipe it clean and start afresh.

, Glitter is a great way of highlighting your favorite feature or color in a face paint design, and will also give your butterfly some extra pizzazz. You might also try skin-safe metallic paints, like silver or gold, to add elegance to your face-art.

This will set the tone of you skin and make your face even and receptive to your cat makeup.If you want to take your makeup one step further, you can cover your face in the color that matches the kind of cat you want to be. For instance, if you want to be a black cat, try painting the main part of your face white and the area on the outside of your face black. The white area will allow you to paint on the cat features better and the black adds dynamic color changes in your makeup.;
, Once you have on your base makeup, you need to start your cat eyes. Get your favorite brand of liquid black eyeliner. Starting from the inside of your eye, line your upper lash line with the black eyeliner. Once you get to the outer edge, make a small wing out to give you a cat eye shape. Repeat on your other eye. This will be the base of the bottom eye makeup, so it can be as dramatic or as subtle as you want, depending on how you want your eyes to look.Make sure the wings you draw are as even as possible. You don't want your face to appear uneven.
If you don't have a liquid eyeliner pencil, you can use a normal eyeliner pencil. Make sure you sharpen it well so it will give you the same thin, crisp line as the liquid eyeliner.

, On your upper lid, pick a subtle color that is complementary to your skin tone. Cover your lid with the color you choose, applying it high enough that you can see it when your eyes are closed and out as far as the wing of your eyeliner. Repeat on the opposite lid.


Gold, bronze, brown, light purple, beige, or a shimmering white are good complimentary colors that will contour your eyes and add depth to the cat eye effect., Now it's time to finish the cat eye shape around your lids. Start from the edge of the line you made on your top lid. Draw a small line down just past your lower lid along your nose, following the angle of your eye. Next, connect the end of this line to the edge of your lower lash line, making a small triangle shape. Then, line your lower lid close to your lashes, drawing a wing downward on the outer edge to match your upper lid.


You can also connect the lower wing to the one on your upper lid. This gives you a more angular cat eye.You can also add some darker eye shadow below your lower lash line to give you a smoky eye. You can also accomplish this by making your lower lash line thicker and then smudging the edges of your eye liner., Using an eyelash curler, curl both your eyelashes. Apply a generous layer of mascara to both your top and bottom lashes. Repeat on your other eye. This gives you that mischievous, sneaky look that cats have.


If you want, you can also skip this step and use fake eyelashes instead. Apply them like normal, making sure to not mess up your other makeup., Now that you have the cat eyes, you need to make your cat nose. Using waterproof eyeliner, fill in the skin around your nostrils on the underside of your nose. Following the contours of your nostrils, color around the upper edge of your nostrils. Once you're done filling your nose in, draw a small, straight line down to your lips from the middle of your nose.


Make sure you keep the slight dip in your nose as you draw along the top edge. This makes it look more natural.If you don't want to fill in all of your nose, you can make a slight handlebar along the outer edge below your nostrils, which will give the hint of a cat nose without the excessive use of makeup.You can also go traditional and draw a simple triangle on your nose. It's not as elaborate as the other nose but it does create a cute, simplistic look., Now that you have the cat eyes and nose, you need to finish the look off with whiskers. In the area under your lip, draw small dots on both sides with your black eyeliner pencil. You can draw as many or as few as you think looks best. Once you've drawn as many as you want, draw whiskers out from the dots on the edge of your lip area. You should draw at least three, but you can draw more if you want. The top ones should point up the contours of your face, the middle whiskers should go straight out sideways, and the bottom ones should point slightly down.If you are going for a more refined look, you can leave off the whiskers and just draw the dots, insinuating the whiskers without actually drawing them., All you have left to complete is your lips. You can put on your favorite color of lipstick as your base. Pink and red go well with the dark cat makeup. On top of that, take your black eyeliner and draw a line along the top of your lip. This gives the illusion of cat lips.You can also outline your entire mouth with black eyeliner, giving you a slightly more defined mouth., If you want to be a particular kind of cat, such as a calico cat or even a cheetah, you can add some additional flare to your makeup to make you look more like these cats. You can add cheetah spots in black around your face or paint on black and orange stripes to add an extra layer to your costume., Depending on the kind of cat you are, you need to choose clothes that match the kind of fur you want. For example, if you want to be a black cat, wear a black shirt with black leggings or a black dress with black flats. If you want to be a calico cat, you can wear a white shirt, an orange sweater, and black tights to give you the spotted effect.This is the fun part. Make the costume something that you are comfortable in but that fits the kind of cat you want to be.

, Ears are super important to the cat costume. To make your own, grab some cardboard, cardstock, or other thick material. Draw the shape of one cat ear onto the cardboard, elongating the bottom of the ear by about a quarter of an inch. This will be used to make them wearable later. Cut it out. Using it as a stencil, trace around it onto the cardboard, making an exact duplicate. Cut this one out as well., Once you've cut them out and you make sure they match, color the ears black, using either black paint or markers. Once they've dried, fold up the elongated strip at the bottom of the ears. Then, fold the quarter inch section in half, forming a small triangular tube when you fold it against the back of the ear. Tape the flap to the back of the ear, securing it in place. Using two bobby pins, slide one through each of the triangular tubes. Now you can attach them to your hair.


When you apply them, make sure they are even in your hair. You don't want your ears to be uneven.
When you tape up the tube area, make sure you cut off any excessive tape from your ears. They will look messy otherwise.
The benefit of these ears is that you can style your hair in any way that you want and apply them when you're done. You don't have to worry about a headband pinching your head all night or messing up your hair style.
You can also buy pre-made cat ears at a costume store if you don't want to make your own., The tail of your costume can be made using any black material that you have lying around, but a pair of old black cotton tights works well. Cut both legs off the tights at the length you want your tail. One will be used for your tail and the other for stuffing your tail. Measure two pieces of floral wire a little longer than the length of the tail. Bend the wire at the ends so you don't poke yourself., To finish the tail, wrap the floral wire with the other leg of the tight. Wrap the wire and tight with the first leg of the tight. Pull it snug at the bottom, making the point at the end. The stuffing should be moved around to where the rest of the tail gets bigger from the end. Using black thread, sew the edges of the tights together. Taking an extra piece of fabric or a tie from a robe or dress, sew the top edge of the tail to the middle of the tie, securing it in place. Shape the wire in the tail into the shape you want your tail. Once it's the way you want, wrap the tie or fabric around your waist and put your clothes on around it. You're costume is now complete.If you are wearing a dress and can't hind the top of the tail, try adding a belt to hide the sash. You can also skip the tie all together and simply clip it to the back of your pants, dress, or tights.The seams in your sewing don't have to be perfect. They will be on the underside of the tail and you won't be able to see them.
You can also use fabric glue or fabric tape if you don't know how to sew.You can also buy costume tails if you don't want to make your own.

Check the finished product.",How to Make Furry Cat Ears," This will be the template for the wire. Basically, you just need to draw two wide triangles. You might like to try drawing a few different sizes to see which size looks best on your head. You can cut out the template, or leave the cat ears drawn on the paper. Keep this design as your template for the remaining steps.Keep in mind that the template will be slightly smaller than the finished ears because of the fur. A template of about three inches is a good size to use.
It doesn’t matter what you use to draw the ears, but pencil is good to use if you will be redrawing the ears multiple times.;
, Following the paper template, bend the wire into the shape of the cat ears. Jewelry wire should be fairly easy to bend, but you can use a pair of long nose pliers to help form the shape. Do this for both ears and you should end up with two triangle shaped ears.


If you don't have wire, you can use paperclips. Just straighten them out and use them as wire. Don't worry if they don't make a perfect triangle. It won't matter when you put them in the fur. Use glue to bind the sides until you put them in.
Use a jewelry wire that is thicker so that it won’t fall out of shape when fur is added to them. 16 or 18 gauge is a good choice because it is thick, but can be bent without too much effort by using pliers.

, Following the paper templates again, cut out four triangle shapes in fur. You can use any type of fur that appeals to you, like black, leopard print, or lion-like fur. Fur can be purchased at an arts and crafts store. These should be about a half an inch larger than the template, though, as the fur needs to hold the wire triangles inside once stitched up.Remember that you can always make it smaller if it's too big, but you can't make it bigger if it's too small.

, Place two fur pieces together. The fur sides should be facing each other. Sew each side, but leave the bottom edge unsewn. That is the part you are going to insert the wire through to shape the ears. The finished product should be inside out. Repeat this step until you have two ears.There should be very little seam allowance—only about an ¼ of a inch.
Use a color of thread that best matches the color of fur.

, The ears should be inside out with the fur parts facing each other once you have finished sewing. Now, turn the ears so that the fur is on the outside. The ear shape should be really obvious now. Inspect the ears to make sure that there aren’t any holes or mistakes.Turn the ears inside out and sew up any holes that you find.
Use a pair of sewing scissors to cut the thread where any mistakes have been made. Remove the thread from that part and sew it back up with new thread.

, Insert the wire you shaped into triangles earlier into the furry ears. The wire should be able to fit snugly inside of the fur without too much or too little room. Adjust the wire if necessary.

, Once you have inserted the wires into the furry ears, sew up the bottom portion that is still open. There shouldn’t be any opening on the ears when you have finished sewing. It doesn't matter if this sewing line is messy, as nobody is going to see it., Measure the elastic band or ribbon around your head. The ribbon should cross over the top of your head rather than your forehead. You can find a band or ribbon at most arts and crafts stores. Sew or hot glue the ends together to form a circular headband that fits your head. If you’re using a ribbon, you can also choose to tie the ribbon in the back so that it is adjustable.If sewing, include a seam allowance in your measurements before cutting the ribbon. Tie the ribbon when testing it on your head to see how much ribbon will be needed in total.
You can also choose to use a headband instead of an elastic band or ribbon.

, First, hold the band and ears together to see where the ears look most natural. Then, check in the mirror to see where the ears look best. Making marks on the headband while it is on your head, use a pen or marker to make marks where the ears will be covering.It may be easier to have someone help you make the marks while the band is on your head.

, Use hot glue to attach the cat ears onto the headband in the positions that you marked. Use just enough so that the ears stay up, but don’t use so much that the glue gets on other places on the headband or ribbon. Allow at least ten minutes for the glue to dry.Have someone help you with the hot glue if you aren’t comfortable with using it on your own.

, Once the glue has dried, try on the ears. The band should fit your head without sliding. The ears should be standing straight up. Make any adjustments as needed."

They are more like filing cabinets, holding links to every movie and episode they have access too. Once you click on a link from you internet search you'll go to a page with series of links, often with names like VidShare, PutLocker, MooShare, etc. These links have the actual videos in them, and are usually ranked by usability.


There is often a ""score"" next to each video, telling you how good the quality is.
Never click on a ""download"" link, or click links outside of this list, as they are usually spam.

, The title of the episode or movie is usually colored and bolded. This is your link. Click here to be taken to a new page with a rectangular video player in the middle.


If you are not taken to a video screen, exit out of the page and try another link.

, There may be a lot of other buttons an the site, but these are for ads. You can exit out of them by clicking on the small ""X"" in the upper right corner of the ad, but most of them disappear once your click the play button. This is usually in the bottom left corner of the video player.

, There are many foreign streaming video sites that exist in a legal gray area thanks to lax or out-of-date copyright protection laws in countries such as China and Russia. Though a dubious choice at best, these sites sometimes feature streaming media (especially major movies) that can't be found for free anywhere else.


Exercise caution when dealing with foreign sites. Malware and spyware are common. Never download anything from these sites, and be sure that your antivirus program is up to date.
Expect extraordinarily slow load times. Unlike YouTube and other popular Western sites, most of these sites use outdated hardware that causes their videos to load slowly even on fast computers.

If you get caught, you could face very stiff fines and/or jail time. That said, millions of people torrent across the globe to find exactly the movies and TV they want for free.

, A torrent client is how you download torrents and convert them into a format you can watch. There is no central server – torrents are a way to share information from one computer to another. There are multiple clients available for free online. Some of the more popular ones are:


µTorrent
Vuze

, There are a variety of websites that list torrents, which you can find by searching for ""torrent tracker"" online. The most reliable ones are easy to navigate, have a variety of links, and are not impossibly cluttered with advertisements.

, Most public trackers will have a copy of every recent show and movie shortly after they are released.


Use popular shorthand for finding the file you want. For example: if you need the second episode from the third season of a show, search for ""show name s03e02.""

, Torrents are popular when they have ""seeders,"" which is often noted right next to the title after you search. The speed at which you can download a torrent file is determined by the number of seeders available.


Most torrent sites allow you to sort search results by the number of seeders by clicking on the word ""seeders"" at the top of the page. Torrents with many seeders are less likely to have viruses, as multiple people have used it successfully.

, Most sites have a comment section underneath the link to ""download torrent."" Read as many comments as possible to determine if other users feel that the quality of the file is good and worth your time. Many sites also have a rating system that can help your quickly determine if the torrent is good.

, This will open the torrent in your client and automatically download the file. When it is done you can watch your videos!

, These files are slightly different than a standard torrent file. They match content based on an identifier that can then be found without central trackers."

Test your ability to stream video on YouTube.,
Perform a speed test.,
Update your plug-ins when prompted.,
Download free anti-virus software to protect your computer.",How to Watch Movies and TV Online for Free4," Visit YouTube and choose a video that's at least a few minutes long, such as a music video. Does the video load within 10-20 seconds and play back without pausing or skipping? If so, your connection is probably strong enough for most streaming video services. If not, look into getting a newer computer or a faster Internet connection.

, To check your connection speed, visit SpeedTest.net and click the green button that says BEGIN TEST. Anything slower than about 256Kbps might be too slow for adequate video streaming.


Mbps is a higher number than Kbps. If your number has Mbps after it, you probably have an adequate connection speed. However, 0.535 Mbps is the same speed as 535.55 Kbps.
Nearly any new computer will be more than adequate for streaming video. If your computer is the problem, feel free to buy something very cheap as long as it's new.

, Sometimes you'll find a video that won't play until your download a specific plug-in, which teaches your computer how to read the video. While you should always be aware of scams, the three main plug-ins to update are Microsoft Silverlight, DivX, and Adobe Flash.

, Depending on how badly you want to view movies and TV, you may accidentally stumble upon sites with bugs and viruses. If you avoid downloading and clicking on ads, most of these can be avoided, but you should still be prepared.

Start with a clean face.,
Apply some spirit gum to your face.,
Flatten some scar wax into a disk.,
Smooth the wax onto your face.,
Make curved, angled lines to form gills.,
Seal the gills.,
Apply a dusting of setting powder.,
Apply some liquid foundation using a foundation brush or foam applicator.,
Add some shading with eyeshadow or body paint.,
Add some detail with eyeshadow or body paint.,
Add some highlight.,
Set the gills once more.",How to Create Costume Gills1," Wash your face with facial cleanser and warm water, then pat it dry with a clean towel. You will be applying the scar wax/modeling wax using spirit gum. Any dirt, oils, or makeup will prevent that from sticking.


Don't worry about applying makeup just yet. You will do that after you apply the gills.;
, Focus on the area where you will by applying the gills. This includes the entire gill area, including the length and width. The spirit gum will get tacky as you prepare the wax.It does not matter which side you start on: right or left. Plan on working on one side at a time.
You will need to repeat this entire method for the other side when you are done.

, Use a small, metal spatula or palette knife to scoop out some scar wax or modeling wax out of the jar that it came in. Knead the wax between your fingers until it softens, then flatten it into a disk about the size you want the gill area to be.Aim to make the disk about 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.63 centimeters) wide. You want it big enough to make gills on, and but so big that it falls off.

, Place the scar wax over the spirit gum and smooth down the edges. Run your fingers across the wax, starting from the center, and going past the edges. This will smooth the edges down until they blend with your face, but leave the center part nice and thick.The scar wax needs to blend into your skin and appear as a lump. Don't worry about the color, however.

, Use a butter knife, spoon, or toothpick to draw some curved lines into the center of the scar wax. Make the curved part face your nose, and the two ends face your ear. Do not draw straight down into the wax. Instead, angle your tool towards your nose.You can have as many or as few gills as you'd like. Make sure that they all angle the same way and are the same distance apart.
Try to draw on the thick part of the scar wax.

, You can use clear liquid latex or a theatrical-grade ""wax sealer."" Simply brush the product onto the entire scar wax surface. Extend it just past the edges of the scar wax disk and onto your skin. Allow the product to dry., You can use theatrical-grade setting powder for this, or your own setting powder. This will help even out the texture and make it easier to apply the makeup. You can apply the setting powder with a large, fluffy brush, like the kind you'd use for applying blush., Be sure that the foundation matches your skin tone. This will blend the gills into your skin and make them more believable. Don't worry about filling in the gaps inside the gills.


You can also be a fantasy mermaid/merman. Paint the gills using body paint or foundation in an unusual color, such as blue or green.

, Use a thin brush to add some shading into the gills. You want to use a darker shade of whatever color your used on top of the gills. For example, if you make the gills skin toned, you'd want to shade them in using browns. If you used green, you'd want to use a very dark green. If you used blue, you'd want to use a very dark blue, etc.Some body paints need to be ""activated"" with water or rubbing alcohol.

, If you make your gills skin toned, you can make them even more life-like by filling them in with some deep reds, plums, etc. If you made your gills a more unusual color, consider filling a spray bottle with liquid body paint in a darker shade, then spritzing your gills to give them a splotchy look., Use a thin brush to apply some highlighter, eyeshadow, foundation, or body paint along the very edges/tips of your gills. Use ivory, cream, or white for skin toned gills.Use white, silver, or a lighter shade of whatever base color you used for ""fantasy"" gills.

, You can set them with setting powder, preferably theatrical-grade, or you can use setting spray. Be sure to get the setting product inside the gills as well.

Start with clean skin.,
Apply some spirit gum on the side of your neck.,
Knead some scar wax into a sausage shape.,
Place the coil against your neck.,
Smooth the top and side edges of the gills down.,
Add another gill on top.,
Seal the gills with clear liquid latex.,
Apply a dusting of setting powder with a large, fluffy brush.,
Apply some liquid foundation to the gills.,
Add some shading.,
Add some detail.,
Add some highlight.,
Set the gills one last time.",How to Create Costume Gills2," Use soap and water to wash your neck, and a soft, clean towel to pat it dry. Any oils or surface dirt could prevent the spirit gum and wax from sticking.

, Use the brush applicator that came with your bottle of spirit gum to apply a few streaks onto your neck, right where you want the gills to go. The spirit gum will allow the wax to adhere to your skin. The spirit gum will become tacky as you prepare the wax.You can apply the gills to the left side or the right side first. You will need to repeat this entire section for the other side.

, Use a metal spatula or palette knife to scoop out some scar wax or modeling wax. Knead it between your fingers until it softens, then roll it out into a thin coil. Curve the coil into a sausage shape.This will make one gill. How big you make it is up to you.

, You will be making several gills and applying them right above the other. This first gill will be the bottommost one. Place it right at the bottom of the spirit gum area, with the curved part pointing up to your jaw., Use your fingers to smooth the top, curved part of the coil down onto your skin. Next, smooth the side edges down. Keep smoothing until the wax blends with your skin. Do not smooth the bottom/inner part of the curve. This will create depth for a thick, fleshy gill., Once you are happy with your gill, scoop out some more wax and roll it into another sausage shape. Place it right above the first one. You can overlap the wax that's already there, or place it just above it. Smooth it down just like the first one.You can add another gill for a total of three.
At some point, the spirit gum will dry. If that happens, simply apply more, and let it become tacky.

, You can also use a theatrical-grade ""wax sealer."" Brush the product over the gills. Extend it just past the scar wax and onto the skin. Let the product dry before moving on.

, You can use theatrical-grade setting powder or regular setting powder. This will even out the texture and make it easier to apply foundation.

, Use a color that matches your skin tone and a foundation brush or foam applicator. This will blend the gills into your skin and make them more realistic. Don't worry about filling the area inside the gills. Focus instead on the gills themselves and the surrounding skin.


You don't have to paint your entire neck, but you do want to blend the foundation into your skin a little.

, Use a thin brush to add some eyeshadow or body paint into the gaps between the gills. Use colors like pinks, dark reds, browns, and plums.Some types of body paints need to be ""activated"" with water or rubbing alcohol.

, Neck gills aren't as detailed as face gills because of how fleshy they are. You can make them look more life-like by adding some warm tones, however. Use a small brush to tap some pink eyeshadow or blush onto the tops of the gills, where the light would hit them. This will make it look like blood is flowing through them. If you have dark skin, opt for a darker shadow of pink or your usual bronzer.

, Use a thin brush to apply some highlighter, eyeshadow, foundation, or body paint to the very edges of your gills, right next to the shadowy part. Choose a light color, such as ivory, cream, or white for skin toned gills.

, You can use setting powder, preferably theatrical-grade, or setting spray. Make sure that you get the setting product inside the gills as well. Use a thin eyeshadow brush if you need to.

If you can't find a pink headband, you can create one yourself. Buy one in another color, or use one you have around the house. Paint it pink. You can also wrap it in pink ribbon, using a glue gun to secure the ribbon.
To wrap the headband, start by gluing the ribbon to one end. Add glue to one side of the ribbon, only going a few inches at a time. Begin wrapping the ribbon along the headband, overlapping slightly as you go. Keep adding glue and wrapping until you reach the other end. Cut off the extra ribbon, and glue the tail in place.;
, When cutting them, fold the felt in half to cut the ears. The bottom of the ears is where the fabric folds and makes a line.Measure 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) along the fold.
Cut a curved line up from one side of the fold. Curve it out and then back in, making it about 4 to 5 inches high. You'll be making a point for the top of the ear.
Move to the other side, and mimic the line you just cut, ending in a point.
If you want, you can also cut a single-layer inner ear out of white felt. Make it the same shape as the bigger ear, but smaller, so it fits inside the boundaries of the outer ear.

, Lay the headband in the fold of each ear. Fold each ear up over the headband so it matches. Rearrange it so the ears are just to the left and right of the center. You'll need a gap that is an inch or two wide in the middle between the ears. Unfold them so you can add glue., That is, where the ears are going to fold up, add glue to the bottom of the headband. Press the inside fold into the glue on the headband. The ears should be held in place, but not glued together at this point.You can also add a piece of sturdy cardboard or plastic to the inside for extra support.Cut out a piece that is slightly smaller than the large ear, and glue it inside the big ear on the inside of the back piece. Leave room around the edges for glue.

, Add glue to the inside of each piece of fabric, and fold them closed.Essentially, you're turning the double piece of fabric into one ear on each side.

, Arrange the piece in the middle of the ear, and then pick it up to glue it in place.

, You can use a larger cup if you are making an adult costume. Cut down from the top until you are an inch or so from the bottom. Turn the scissors to cut around the cup, leaving you with a smaller cup.Alternatively, you can use a toilet paper roll, cut down to an inch or two in height.You can also use a clean, large plastic bottle cap. Paint the cap pink., Add a line of glue across the inside middle of the cup or cap, including going up the sides. Press the elastic across the line, being careful not to get your fingers in the hot glue. You can use a pencil to help press it down. The elastic should be long enough that you can measure it on the person and tie it off later.If you're using a toilet paper roll, cut two pieces of elastic to glue to the insides of the roll. Add a line up one side of the toilet paper roll, inside. Press the elastic along the line. Repeat on the other side.You can also add a ribbon instead of elastic, using the same gluing technique. Just make it long enough to tie., Make it large enough to cover the entire outside of the cup or toilet paper roll and the inside edge, as you will be folding it over at the top.Skip this step for the bottle cap.

, If you're using a toilet paper roll or bottle cap, skip this step. , If it is not laying flat, you can cut wedges out of the circle, like cutting a piece of pie. Then fit the edges together as you glue. Cut a space for the elastic to go through on both sides.Skip this step if you painted a bottle cap.

, Overlap the fabric, being sure to leave space for the elastic to come out., Cut and glue two small black ovals to the front to complete the snout. They should sit vertically rather than horizontally.You can cut out holes instead of adding ovals.You can also add a small button to complete the snout instead of ovals. Pink or black would be the most appropriate. Glue it in the middle., Cut the elastic or ribbon shorter as needed. Tie the elastic in a knot, as it will slip on easily later because it stretches. Leave the ribbon undone until you want to put the costume on the person.

, Cut a spiral shape out of the fabric, starting with a flat piece on one end and ending in a point. You're essentially cutting out two pieces at once so they match., Sew down either side of the fleece pieces to sew them together. Leave the flat piece at the end open., You're placing the edges of the seams on the inside so the tail looks better. You can use a pencil to help.. Some crafters use hemostats for this purpose, by pushing them inside, grabbing the other end of the tail, and then working the fabric over the hemostats.

, Tuck the flat end into the tail, and sew it together., Add matching tights or pants. Don't be afraid to add a little pizzazz, such as striped white and pink pants.

, You can also use pale pink. Make it large, but keep it small enough to fit inside the boundaries of the front of the shirt., Use fabric glue to add the oval to the center of the shirt. You can also sew this piece on.If you want to add some stuffing to your costume, only add glue around the edges. Leave a couple of inches open on one side. Let the glue dry. Stuff the belly. Glue or sew the edge in place., Stitch it to the bottom.

, Find some black, brown, or gray shoes to complete the outfit.

Make sure you have the necessary connection speed and plug-ins for streaming movies.,
Check your system requirements for video.,
Subscribe to a video streaming rental service online.,
Rent movies directly from iTunes or GooglePlay.,
Select a video.,
Let the video buffer, if necessary.",How to Rent a Movie1," The most common way of watching movies is usually streaming them instantly on the Internet, or downloading movies temporarily for a rental fee. You can watch on a mobile device, your computer, or by hooking up a Network Media Player to your television (discussed in the next method). You can watch high-qualify video without even leaving the house, provided your computer is outfitted with the following:


1.5 megabits per second speed is usually necessary for regular viewing, while 5.0 is needed for HD viewing. If you want to upgrade the speed of your Internet connection, talk to your cable provider.
The HTML5 plug-in is also necessary to use Netflix and most other streaming services. This should come standard with the most recent update of most browsers. Update your software to the most recent version, if necessary.;
, Make sure your computer has the right system requirements for streaming high qualify video quickly, or you may end up watching slow-buffering grainy VHS-quality movies. 1080p content on most streaming services should be compatible with iPads 3rd generation or later and Apple TV 3rd generation or later. Mac and PC requirements are discussed below:


Mac Requirements

Mac OS X v10.5 or later
iTunes 10 or later
2.0 Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo or faster processor
At least 1 GB of RAM
A display that supports HDCP with a screen resolution of 1024 x 768 or higher


Windows Requirements

32 or 64-bit version of Windows 7 or Windows 8; Windows XP and Vista don't support HDCP
iTunes 10 or later
2.0 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo or faster processor
At least 1 GB of RAM
A video driver that supports HDCP (you may need to check with the manufacturer to determine if your video driver supports HDCP)
A display that supports HDCP with a screen resolution of 1024 x 768 or higher with a digital connection (DVI, DisplayPort, or HDMI)



, Renting a movie is a snap if you subscribe to a video streaming service, for a monthly fee. Many of them have a huge variety of new and old content for you to browse, and playing the video is as easy as selecting and pushing play. All you need to do to get started is navigate to the homepage of the streaming service you're interested in and open an account. Common streaming services include:


Netflix
Amazon Prime
Vudu
Hulu Plus

, If you've already got an iTunes account, you can rent a movie right now. The biggest difference between renting from iTunes or GooglePlay and a streaming service, is that you'll download the content for a limited period of time to watch it, before it will disappear. You can view the content on the computer and other mobile devices you've set up to be compatible with the service.


If you don’t have an account and want to start one, start one by navigating to the website and adding your ID and billing information. You'll have to download the software to get started, and then you'll be ready to select among the music and video available.
Since you’re downloading, this is typically a better option if you’ve got a relatively slow Internet connection. It might take you a while to download the content, but you’ll be able to watch it without having to pause while the video buffers and catches up.

, Whether you're using Netflix, iTunes, or some other streaming or online rental service, you can browse through the available options and select a video of your choice. Most services allow you to read a synopsis, user reviews, and browse recommended content based on your prior viewing choices and your own reviews. Look for something interesting and select it to play.


If you've got a particular title in mind, you can search for it in the search bar by title, names of the director or the actors, or a specific genre if you want to browse around.
If you don't have a title in mind, look at the most recent popular options for new videos you might not have seen yet. Take a few minutes to rate some of your favorite movies to give the service a chance to recommend a lost classic you may have missed.

, If you're streaming your content, it might need some time to load, depending on how fast your Internet connection is. At peak periods–in the early evening–lots of basic Internet connections will slow considerably, and streaming multiple devices at the same time can also slow the speed by a substantial amount. If you're struggling with your speed, talk to your cable provider to learn about upgrades, and take steps yourself to improve the streaming quality.


Try to only stream one device at a time. Pause any other downloads or online browsers you have open and let all the streaming capacity go straight to the video you're watching. If you're still experiencing struggles, pause the video and leave it a lone for a while to catch up.

Begin at a time that is good for everyone.,
Select the room you are going to watch the movie in.,
Make popcorn.,
Pick a movie.,
Turn the lights off, if no one will get scared and cry about it.,
Ask everyone to be quiet and tell them to enjoy the movie.,
At the end of the movie, ask your family what they thought about it.,
If there was a moral of the story (and there usually is), discuss it with your family.,
Bedtime is a great way to end a movie night!

",How to Watch a Movie With Your Family," It’s best if the whole family can be involved – mom, dad, sister, brother, even your dog. It’s the most fun if it’s in the evening because kids will think they are getting to “stay up late”. However, if you have young children or children with busy schedules, perhaps the movie shouldn’t run late into the night. Ending at 7:00 or as late as 8:30 is a good choice.;
, It doesn’t matter whether it’s the media room or living room. It should be a comfortable space with room for everyone to sit – preferably on a couch together. You don’t have to buy a huge TV; just something bigger than an iPod screen will work.

, Popcorn, by itself, is a light snack that everyone will enjoy. It’s good with M&Ms, but it’s up to you to decide what goes with it. You could even try cinnamon-sugar popcorn by first putting melted butter over the popcorn and then liberally sprinkling a container of cinnamon-sugar over it all. Eating snacks while watching a movie may be lazy, but it makes the evening 100% better. If the children are prone to fighting, you can give them individual bowls of popcorn. If kids are eating too fast, tell them there is plenty and that they need to slow down.

, (See “Tips” for suggest movies.) Ask for movie suggestions. Make sure it is age-appropriate. Your teenager may suggest a movie you aren’t comfortable with your kids seeing. It is perfectly fine to deny your teen that choice in a nice way. You can suggest that she make a more family-friendly selection, indicating that she gets another shot at choosing. If your children don’t agree on a movie or can’t choose one, make a few family friendly suggestions, preferably rated G or even PG, depending on how old your children are and how well they could handle a slightly more mature movie. Family movie night, with children, should not go above PG. You don’t want your child to have nightmares! Try to encourage a movie that none of you have seen before, or you haven’t seen in a long time. Films rated PG however, might not be suitable for children below age 10, so its recommended to see a G rated film if you have children under 10.

, This gives a sort of movie theatre illusion and makes the entire atmosphere much more fun. In addition, the TV screen is a lot brighter.

, Laugh with your children during hilarious scenes, but try not to talk to anyone during the movie; it’s distracting.

, Did they like it? Was it scary, sad, funny? Who was their favorite character? What was their favorite part? Children will enjoy talking about this and reviewing their favorite scenes – even reenacting them!

, You can simply talk about it or dig deeper into the subject – whatever you and your family is comfortable with.

Read through the script with an open mind.,
Break the script down scene by scene.,
Study the writing style.,
Read the script out loud.,
Put the script on its feet.,
Film the script.",How to Read a Movie Script," Screenplays are formatted differently from books or even stage-plays. Educating yourself on proper screenplay formatting will help you avoid confusion and will allow you to focus on what’s really important: the characters and story.The scene heading is the one line description at the top of each scene. This should include the location of the scene, the time of day and whether the scene takes place indoors or outside. This line is also called a “slugline.”
Any time a character appears for the first time, their name will be written in all capital letters.
Dialogue is centered in screenwriting and the character’s name appears directly above any dialogue they might say.
Parentheticals are used to convey a character’s attitude or action. Action can also appear on its own line, to help break up the dialogue between characters.;
, Most movie scripts are written in three-act structure. In three-act structure, the first act serves as your setup, the second act serves as your confrontation and the third act serves as your resolution.The first act should introduce the main characters, set up the world they live in and foreshadow the conflict they will encounter during the course of their story. The first act should last approximately 30 pages.
The second act should escalate the conflict. If at the end of the first act, the hero was sent on a journey, the second act will consist of that journey. Here, your hero will encounter a series of problems and obstacles that have been set up to keep them from achieving their goal. The second act is all about raising the stakes and it should last approximately 60 pages.
The third act is all about tying up loose ends. In this act, the hero will have their final confrontation and complete their character arc. This is also a chance to answer any final questions left open in the script. The third act should last approximately 30 pages.

, In order for a screenplay to be successful, the protagonist needs to change in some way. The change can be as simple as “learning how to love” or “becoming educated,” but they need to leave the movie having changed or grown in some way.While reading the script, list all the points where the character grows or evolves. There should be several moments where this occurs in each act, so look closely!
Any good character should have a clear want or goal they mean to achieve. Note what their goal or want is at the beginning of the script and ask yourself if they got what they wanted in the end. Sometimes character wants or goals change mid-story, so be on the look out for that as well.

, Find a quiet room with no distractions. Read through the script from start to finish. Quiet your mind so you’re not analyzing the script, you’re just enjoying the story and characters.If an observation strikes you during your initial read, write it down and return to it later.
Avoid taking breaks so you can really get lost in the world of the script.
If possible, read a hard copy of the script. This way, you avoid the distractions that come with reading on your phone or computer.

, After you’ve read the script one time all the way through, go back and read it again. This time, make a list of all the different scenes in the script.If scenes are working towards a common event or show a continuous piece of action, group those scenes together.
Once you have done this, use your scenic breakdown to help you think about the way the movie is structured and to look for patterns and themes within the script.
Use your scene by scene breakdown to help identify the major plot points and the moments where the narrative is forced in an entirely new direction.

, All writers have different styles and methods for working with language and the same holds true for screenwriters. Comb the script for moments where the writer uses actionable, visual language. Make a list of all the examples you can find. For example, if the writer wrote, “Staggers into a telephone pole,” you would add that to your list.Making a list of all the visual writing will help you to really envision the action occurring in the script.
It will also help you to make your own scripts stronger, if and when you start writing them.
Try to read a vast array of different screenwriters. The more movie scripts you read, the better you will get at reading, writing and analyzing screenplays.

, The best way to really hear what a script is saying is to read it out loud, preferably with other people. Invite your friends over to do a table read. Have everyone sit in a circle and read the script out loud, together.Make sure to assign characters so everyone knows what part they are reading for. If you don’t have enough people, ask some actors to double up on smaller roles.
Remember to assign someone to read the stage directions.
Make sure to print out enough copies of the script so that everyone has their own.

, If you’re feeling particularly ambitious, invite your friends over to perform the script. Have everyone stand at podiums and act the script out from there, or block out the action and dialogue, as if you were performing a play.


Invite people to come watch the performance. Having an audience will help you to hear and see which parts of the script are resonating the most.
After you have completed performing the script, ask your friends for their thoughts and feedback. Their ideas may inspire you to see the script in a new light.

, If you wrote the script or have the rights for the script, try filming a scene or two. In the process of producing the scenes and working with your actors, you are guaranteed to make new discoveries regarding motivations, plot and characters.You don’t have to spend a lot of money to film the script. If you don’t have access to fancy equipment, film the scenes on someone’s phone and edit them using iMovie.
Work with your actors in rehearsal to uncover the motivations behind each line of dialogue and action. Challenge them to make their own discoveries and to not adhere solely to what’s written on the page.

Set up a Network Media Player to watch streaming video on your television.,
Open your streaming service rental account, or start a new one.,
Select a movie.,
Alternatively, rent Pay-Per-View movies from your cable provider.",How to Rent a Movie2," Network Media Players are like conduits that allow you to connect to the Internet and also interface with your television, allowing you to watch streaming video on the big screen. Roku and AppleTV are examples of these devices, but new video game consoles also come with the technology installed. Most of these devices are connected via Ethernet cables, or wirelessly. Each will involve a slightly different set up process, depending on the device. Examples of Network Media Players include:


Apple TV
X-Box 360 or higher
Playstation 3 or higher
Roku

, When you've installed your Network Media Player, use the remote that came with it to navigate to the streaming service to which you subscribe and log in. If you need to start one, you can also use the Network Player to do that, entering your billing information, or hooking it into a pre-existing account.

, Navigate around the options like usual, using your remote. It should work in almost exactly the same way, and should include the same basic content that your online account includes when you access it on your computer. If you watch half of a Netflix movie on your laptop, you can pick it up right where you left off on the TV.

, The classic way of renting movies is to rent pay-per-view directly from the cable provider, or purchase on-demand video options through your cable company. You can usually already see the movies available on your menu screen, select one to purchase, and tune in instantly, or when the allotted time arrives. This will be billed to your cable statement.

Start a Netflix DVD account.,
Consider alternatives.,
Find a RedBox in your area.,
Visit the local library for DVDs.,
Find indie rental stores in your neighborhood.",How to Rent a Movie3," If you want a physical copy of a DVD, the most common way of renting discs is to use Netflix, or some other DVD delivery service. Netflix allows you to select a queue of movies that you're interested in, which will be packed into envelopes and mailed directly to your door in a few days. You can keep the movie for as long as you want and return it for free in the envelope included. You can use this service in addition to your streaming account, if you want, or you can select one or the other. To sign up to receive DVDs from Netflix:


Select a billing plan. There are a variety of options for packages, some more expensive than others. If you just want the streaming service, that's the cheapest option. If you want the streaming service and the occasional DVD, that'll be slightly more expensive. Check with Netflix for the most up-to-date billing options.
After you include your billing info and shipping address, you'll be able to search among the DVDs available and put them into your queue for shipping. There are many thousand more movies available on DVD through Netflix, compared to streaming.

, Other services offer similar experiences to Netflix, but may have a slightly different variety of films available for DVD delivery. If you're unhappy with Netflix, try one of the following:


Blockbuster
DVD Avenue
DVD Barn
Walmart DVD Rental

, If you don't want the commitment of a monthly fee, the next most common way of renting a movie is to find a RedBox close to you. Common outside of fast food restaurants, inside grocery stores, at malls, and in other locations, RedBoxes are touch-screen kiosks that allow you to select between a small variety of movies, pay for it with a credit card, then get the DVD disc instantly.


To find a RedBox, you can search on Google maps to find the closest one, or you can check in with their corporate website to enter your zip-code and find a list of RedBoxes in your area.
You can keep the DVD for as long as you want, but the cost will add by a dollar a day, so it's to your advantage to return it quickly. You can also return the disc to any RedBox kiosk, not just the one you rented it from.

, If you want a DVD without paying for it, the best option is definitely the local library. Most libraries have a large selection of new and old DVDs available for rent. While they may not have the newest films, libraries are a great place to find old classics and foreign films you may have never heard of. Plus it's free. How great is that?


Most libraries allow DVDs to be rented for up to a week at a time, and the late fees are usually slightly higher than that for books. You can usually check out up to five, but the specifics will depend on the library.If you don't have a library card, you'll usually need to provide proof of residence, but you can sign up for a card and usually check out at least one movie right away. Go to your library and talk to someone at the circulation desk for more information.

, While some franchises like Family Video and Blockbuster are still hanging on, online streaming has made it tough on local rental businesses, though some rental joints that cater to cult films and other obscure titles are still successful in certain cities. If your tastes run toward 50s drive-in monster movie schlock, babysitters slasher flicks, and Italian neo-realism, you might be able to find a treasure-trove in your city. Here are some obscure classics:


Plan 9 Film Emporium in Bloomington, IN
Scarecrow Video in Seattle, WA
Glebe Video International in Ottawa

If that doesn't bother you, simply search online for ""+ Free stream."" Even first-run movies are often uploaded, though the quality can be suspect. Since the sites get taken down often, you may have to do some digging to find your movie.

You'll need a torrent client, like uTorrent or BitTorrent, to get and see torrent files.
Always click on the ""magnet link"" for safer downloads.
Only download torrents with lots of ""seeds"" and high reviews. If there are no reviews or comments, it might not be worth the risk.
If a link doesn't feel safe, look for another one."

Take notes on the film as you watch.,
Focus your viewing on the connection between form and function.,
Take a few minutes in the movie to focus on each aspect of production.,
Consider your own opinion, but be ready to back it up.,
Read up on the film's background.",How to Watch a Movie2," You can write down anything that comes to mind, though many critics like to have small sections for the key subjects like ""writing,"" ""acting,"" and ""directing."" No matter your style, taking notes as you watch will make it infinitely easier to write and talk about the movie later on.


Don't worry about what to take notes on at first. Simply write out everything that comes to mind now, then work on shaping the review or writing later on., Form is how a movie is shot -- the lighting, scenery, sound effects, etc. Function is the story being told -- what information is the form trying to convey. The best movies merge these seamlessly. Think about Citizen Kane, whose message on the endless march of time and memory is bolstered by watery cuts, low, dramatic/weird angles, and flashbacks. Every aspect of the movie helps tell the story.


If you hit pause, what does this ""photograph"" tell you? What is the mood? How is the shot designed to be interesting (or not) even when the movie is paused?
What do you think is the theme or point of the movie? What evidence do you have to back it up?
Are there any original or weird artistic choices throughout the movie? Why do you think the director chose to use something unique or different in the movie?, Movies are enormous, collaborative efforts. Each department, even the small ones, must work together to make the entire movie a reality. As such, good critics and movie watchers take time to point out all of the parts of a movie, not just the obvious ones like acting and directing. When watching, take a few notes on:



Production Design: What do the sets look like? How were props and scenery chosen, and how do they add or subtract from the movie?

Sound and Music: This is easy to see when movies get it wrong, but ask yourself how the best movies get it right. Amazing sound effects and music pull you seamlessly into the picture.

Editing: When are long takes used? What about short, choppy editing, where the image changes 2-3 times a second? Each time an editor cuts, it is to give you new information -- are they succeeding?, How you feel about a movie may be the most important, but most neglected, part of any early review. Your opinions are important -- you just need to find ways to back them up with facts. Whenever you have a gut feeling about something -- ""that actor ruined his lines,"" ""the cinematography was incredible,"" ""the movie was 30 minutes too long"" -- don't just dismiss it as a personal preference. Find a way to support your opinion with fact:



""That actor ruined his lines."" Maybe he made too much of a joke out of serious lines. Perhaps he didn't change his facial expressions, he seemed uncomfortable or out of place, etc.

""The cinematography was incredible."" Talk about the lighting in certain scene. Find unique camera angles, or how several key shots commanded your attention.

""The movie was 30 minutes too long."" Think about the scenes or sections you would cut. Consider the part of the movie that should have been highlighted instead, or why you wanted a certain ending instead of the one presented., Movies are not made in a vacuum. They are based on true stories, have complicated creation tales, and interact with current events. While reviews should focus on the films themselves, good critics tap into the real-life context of a movie.


Is this movie making some sort of commentary on current or historical events?
Look up the director's, writer's, and cinematographer's other movies. How does this one relate to the other?"
"
Read the script along with the movie, or before watching.,
Take notes on the timing and pacing of key events.,
Think about how editing choices move the movie along.,
Figure out how they shot your favorite parts of the movie.,
Watch the movie again.,
Save clips, notes, and thoughts on the movie for later references.",How to Watch a Movie3," The script is the blueprint of any film. That said, a filmmaker's job is to turn words on a page into a story with cinematography, sound, lighting, actors, costumes, and much more. A director starts with only the script as well. They try to find the best way to keep the spirit of the words intact (funny, politically-charged, dramatic, etc.) while still telling a unique story. When reading the script, think about:


How would you set up a scene? What kind of props, lighting, and music would you use in the background?
What is the key image or idea of the screenplay? How would you show it on film?
What sort of tone would fit the dialogue? Fast, bright, and witty, or slow and dramatic?
Are there places the movie breaks from the script? Would you have made the same choices?, When is the first big climax? Where is the monster first revealed? At what point do you start to see things from the villain's point of view? Films have to fit in a small time frame, usually under three hours, and thus have developed a rhythm that you need to tap into as a director. Try to keep track of the push and pull of emotions in a good movie. How does timing make or break key moments, like big joke or climactic emotional catharsis?, The easiest way to do this is to ask, ""what did that scene or shot accomplish?"" As a filmmaker, this is your fundamental question -- how do you make the images on screen meaningful? The easiest way to do that is to make sure that the audience is in a different place at the end of a scene or shot as when the begun. When watching great movies, try and find out the motivation between cuts and scenes that may seem unnecessary.


There is no right answer here-- you're just trying to see other filmmakers in action. Even if you don't think a scene is useful, can you see why the director might think it is important?

, If you see a camera angle you love, try and break down how you would recreate it. Think about how you might use a similar special effect in your own films. If you're stuck, look up behind-the-scenes clips and specials online or on the DVD.

, Once you know how a movie ends you can focus on how it got there. On the second viewing, you can focus in on smaller details, like lighting or sound design. You already know the main action. You might see clues and bits of clever foreshadowing now that you know the ending. You can catch how certain shots were set up or filmed without focusing on the acting skills. You haven't watched the movie until you've re-watched it., There are many cinematographers with enormous books composed of their favorite shots and ideas. When you're on set trying to mimic that incredible dolly shot in The Shining, don't just describe it to your camera crew. Show them the shot in action. Just like great writers hold on to quotes and ideas in journals, you should ""quote"" and record great movies."

, You will want to outline from the base of the neck down to the middle of the shirt, creating an oval shape.Paint the inside the oval area using white fabric paint and a wide paint brush and This will give the appearance of Jack Skellington’s white shirt underneath the jacket.
You may also cut along the outline of the initial oval area using fabric shears, then simply wear a white t-shirt underneath your costume for the same effect.

, At this point you should have the appearance of a white shirt with jacket lapels on each side. This should look like an inner ‘U’ shape and an outer ‘U’ shape that both meet in the middle of the shirt., Using a small paintbrush white fabric paint, start at the ends of the shoulders and paint 6-8 straight, vertical lines all the way down to the bottom of each sleeve.


Use a ruler to keep your lines straight while painting.

Repeat the same instructions for the right side, painting approximately 8 lines per side.

, Use your small paintbrush and white fabric paint to from the left side of the shirt to the right.


In the center of the jacket, directly underneath bottom of the lapel, use your white fabric paint to draw a small, circle about the size of a 50 cent piece to replicate the button on Jack’s tuxedo jacket.Set aside to allow all paint to dry.

Read the reviews to see what others have said. Read both what the professional critics say, and what the movie-going public has said. You can decide for yourself whether or not the movie is going to be worth the effort.;
, If going alone, this should be easy but if going with others, confer first and get agreement. If you've gone to the trouble of reading the reviews, give a precis of the reviews so that you can be persuasive about your choice of movie.


Consider booking tickets for the movie online. This can save time in having to line up and it can also save money sometimes.

, Make a meeting place there and a time too. Make sure it's a few minutes before it's time to go in, or longer if you need to buy tickets and treats.

, Cinema treats are often quite pricey, so if you want to save money, take your own. You could even stop at a supermarket or convenience store on the way and purchase chips, candies and drinks before you arrive. Place them in a shopping bag that is opaque––there is no need to advertise you're being budget savvy!


Buying on premises has the advantage of letting you get fresh popcorn or ice creams.
If you want to have water, it can be helpful to take along your water bottle and refill if needed; buying bottled water can be a pricey thing at the cinema.
If you don't want food, a few peppermints or chewing gum might be a nice stand-by in case you do get the munchies during the movie. Just seeing and hearing others eating around you can make you feel hungry too.

, If you know the cinema is air-conditioned, it can be helpful to have a jacket, hoodie or cardigan in case you get too cold.

, It can be useful for the light if the cinema is too dark to find your seat, and it can be used to play games or listen to music while waiting for the movie to play. Remember to turn it off when the movie starts.

Over this he wears a navy blue blazer with the school crest badge pinned on the breast pocket.


He also wears a knit scarf with two large red stripes, striped orange up the center of each, and a navy blue short-billed ""cricket cap"".






In Narnia he removes his shoes, sheds his blazer and vest, and rolls up the sleeves. He carries a brown messenger bag with his torch inside.





;
, This is closed down the front to the sword belt with seven silver metal buttons. The velvet is worn, looking a bit moth-eaten in places. There's a faded gold printing of a diamond pattern on the body of the tunic beginning just at the third button down, that covers to the hem and around the sides of the tunic, not quite matching up at the side seams.


The neck and front opening are edged in a blue cord and faced with the same blue velvet, at the front opening overlapping—the loops for the buttons are possibly sewn down here.
The sleeves are full and gathered into a long cuff that starts mid-forearm,the blueish white undershirt is gathered into the collar, stitched in several rows out from the neck,some yarn loosely ties the front of the undershirt together.
He wears grayish-tan trousers and knee-high boots. He also carries a Narnian shield, sword, and his English bag.

, Ed wears the same shirt and blue velvet tunic as above, with a jerkin over, much like the one Peter wears in the same sequence, It has the same vertical stitch detailing, but only on one side, his right. The jerkin wraps over and buckles at twice at his left.


The leather straps for the buckles are secured with four studs each, the seams at Ed's sides,and the shoulder seams, are whip-stitched. The edges on all sides are bound with the same leather and top-stitched.
He wears brown leather pauldrons that seem to be attached to the jerkin, as they don't buckle under the arm—we do see three studs along the top. The pauldron on his left shoulder is one piece, and on his right, two pieces,a small emblem is engraved into the left pauldron, and each piece is also bound in leather and top-stitched.
There's also a fine scored line bordering the inside. He also wears leather vambraces. And, of course, trousers and his knee-high boots.
For the battle, he wears his Narnian armor you can buy at Halloween stores.

Style your hair.",How to Dress Like Alice from Alice in Wonderland2," For much of the film, Burton’s Alice wears a blue dress that falls close to ankle-length. In some scenes her blue dress is loosely draped and worn off the shoulder. However, in the court scene she wears a strapless red tea-length dress with white and black sheer overlay.


Adults may own a suitable red cocktail dress.
The loosely draped version of the blue dress would be difficult to buy or construct, but could be appropriate as an informal toga-style costume.
Vintage stores and thrift shops can be good places to find affordable longer dresses that can be modified to look like Alice's film costume.

, In the film, Alice does not wear the iconic white pinafore. However, the overlay on the red dress is something like an apron worn backwards; open at the front, covering the back.


You can make your own reverse pinafore by tying a length of black and white fabric across the back of a red dress, and draping part over one shoulder.

, In the film, Alice wears white-tinted stockings but they are sheer and not terribly distinctive. In warm weather, going without stockings would likely be as appropriate as wearing nylons.

, Burton’s Alice wears white lace-up boots with a kitten heel and a black toe. These might be quite difficult to find.


Black and white saddle shoes might provide a convincing alternative.
Some websites that feature vintage imitation clothing, such as Modcloth, stock high heels in black and white that look similar.

Add an apron.,
Decide on tights.,
Decide whether to wear a headband.",How to Dress Like Alice from Alice in Wonderland3," The original illustrations by Tenniel in the book were black and white with no specific color scheme, though light blue is still the most traditional color in subsequent editions.


The first edition with colored illustrations, called The Nursery Alice, featured Alice wearing a yellow dress. While this is an authentic and viable alternative to a blue dress it might not be instantly recognizable to others.In some early editions of Through the Looking Glass, the sequel to the first book, Alice is wearing a red frock. Like a yellow dress, this may not instantly signal to others that you are dressed as Alice., In the book, Alice wears a small apron, also called a pinafore. The illustrations by Tenniel show a white pinafore some trimming around the edge, which in some editions is colored blue. Consider adding some ribbon to your apron if you want to look more like the books., The book illustrations offer more freedom in depicting Alice because they originally had no color, so you could select any shade you think goes well with your dress.


One early edition added blue stockings to go with a yellow dress.In Through the Looking Glass, Alice wears stockings that have horizontal stripes, sometimes colored in blue and white. For an individual flare, wear striped stockings instead., In the original book illustrations, Alice did not have a headband. Tenniel added that detail in the sequel Through the Looking Glass. Decide which book you would like to imitate, and add a headband if you like the look.If you go without a headband, tuck your hair behind your ears and wear it loose around your shoulders, if it is long enough.

Create fairy makeup.",How to Make a Fairy Costume," To make a no-sew tutu, you'll need ribbon (1 inch width), tulle, and scissors. Your tulle can be several different colors or one color, and you'll need enough to fill your entire ribbon waistband and for your desired length.


To figure out how much tulle you'll need, use a measuring tape to measure your waist. Then, measure the length from your waist to the point on your leg in which you want the tulle to fall. You can purchase tulle by the yard, but it may be easier to purchase spools of tulle as they usually already come in widths of six inches, which is good for tutu making.
For roughly every inch of your waistline, you will need anywhere between two to four yards of tulle, depending on how thick and fluffy you want your skirt to be. Spools of six inch tulle usually come in 25 yards, so you'll probably need about three to four of these. If your tutu is going to be long, you'll need more tulle, and if you are going for a shorter tutu, you'll need less tulle.If you aren't sure how much tulle you'll use, start by buying one spool of tulle and if that doesn't end up being enough you can purchase a few more.;
, After you have measured your waist, take that measurement and add 48 inches. Then, cut the ribbon to that length. This will give you a lot of leftover ribbon to tie a bow at the back of your tutu. If you want a smaller bow, you can always cut the ribbon once you have tied it.


For example, if you are making a costume for a little girl and her waistline is 20 inches, you'll want to cut 68 inches.

, To make the tutu, you'll need to cut your tulle strips to your desired length. Take the measurement for the length of your tutu and multiply it by two and then cut strips that length, leaving the six inch width. If you want your tutu to be about 12 inches long, you'll need tulle strips that are 24 inches long, because they will be folded over and knotted.Make sure you give yourself lots of time to cut your tulle. You may have to use anywhere between 75 and 100 yards of tulle, depending on your waist measurement, and it can take some time to cut those strips! Don't stress about getting the cuts perfect, though. Because your tulle will be bunched together, it won't be noticeable if the cuts aren't perfectly straight.

, Before you begin adding your tulle, you will make knots on your ribbon so you know what section to add your tulle to. Fold your ribbon in half, meeting the ends. Then, take your waist measurement and divide it by two, and use that measurement to mark a point down your ribbon from the fold. Then, tie a knot on that side of your ribbon at that measurement and do the exact same step on the other side of the ribbon.Basically, if your waistline is 30 inches, you will divide that by two and end up with 15 inches. Then, you will start at the folded part of your ribbon and measure down your ribbon 15 inches. Mark that point on the ribbon and make a knot on each side of the ribbon. When you unfold the ribbon, you should have 30 inches in between both knots. This is where you will add the tulle.

, Take two pieces of tulle and line them up. Then, fold the tulle in half, and place the folded part under your waistband. Reach through the fold in your ribbon and grab the ends of your tulle. Pull them through your ribbon and pull the tulle until you have created a knot around your ribbon.Pinching your tulle just allows you to bunch it up so it is easier to tie around your ribbon. You can do one piece of tulle at a time if you like, but it will not create as drastic a color. It's easier to do two pieces at once because then you won't have to make double the knots.

, Once you have created your first tulle knot, you will slide the tulle down to one of your knots and continue to add tulle until your tutu is full. If you are using three different colors of tulle or more you can space those out in whatever pattern you like around your ribbon.


Each time you complete a tulle knot, slide it down to the previous tulle knots. This will prevent gaps or holes you may have left in between your tulle.
If you are having difficulty tying your tulle on, you can tie your ribbon around your legs and knot the tulle to your ribbon that way. This just helps keep your ribbon in place and stay taut for you while you work.

, Now that you have added all of your tulle to your ribbon, you can try it on! Straighten the tulle out to make sure it is going in the right direction, and wrap your tutu around your waist. Then tie it in the back with the excess ribbon. If you want a smaller bow, trim the ribbon until you have the desired size.

, For fairy wings you can make realistic wings out of cellophane or costume-esque wings out of panty hose. The latter is simple, so to keep your costume an easy project you'll need two pairs of sheer panty hose, four wire/metal coat hangers, scissors, sturdy tape (not scotch), hot glue, ribbon, and paints or glitter.


You can buy nude panty hose, but if you want your wings to be a certain color, it's easier if you buy that color panty hose. For example, if you want pink wings, purchase two pairs of pink panty hose.

, Start by straightening your hangers so that each one forms one long piece of wire. Then, take two hangers and form the top part of your wings. Take each hanger and form them into a tear drop shape, with the ends at the top of the tear drop. Then, lock in the design by twisting the ends of the hanger together, leaving an inch or two of wire sticking out at the end. Then leave the teardrop shape, or shape your hanger to your desired wing.One option for the top wings is forming a heart in your tear drop by bending the bottom of your tear drop inwards. You can also create a pretty, more elaborate shape by creating three curves in your wing. To do this, make two separate bends in your wire, creating three mountains and two valleys. Repeat this same shape on your other top hanger.

, Fold each hanger into a tear drop shape and twist the ends together, leaving one or two inches of wire as you did for the other two wings. Then, form your hangers into any shape wing you want for your bottom wings. For a bottom wing, you can add a bend in the wire near the bottom of the wing for two curves, or you can shape your tear drop to be more elongated.


For ideas on different wings you can look up pictures online or think about the wing style you want for your costume. To shape your wings it could be helpful to use pliers.

, Take the two top wings and overlap the wire excess of one top wing with the other top wing. Then, take a piece of tape and connect one part of the wire to the other wire. Do the same with your bottom wings until you have two pairs of wings.With each wing you should have two ends of wire. You only want to tape together one end of each wire, as you'll wrap the other ends around your wings. This prevents your connections from being bulky.

, Once you have connected your top wings together and your bottom wings together, you'll need to connect both pairs of wings with more tape. Take the section of top wings that is connected with tape and line it up with the section of your bottom wings connected with tape. Then, connect both of those wings together with tape. Then, wrap the ends of your wires that are still sticking out around each wing so that they are hidden.


You don't have to connect your wings in this exact order. If you want to connect your top and bottom wings together before and then connect both sides of the wings, you can do that. Do whatever gives you the best connections for your wings.

, Taking your tights, cut them at the top of the leg, right before the two legs meet together so that you have four separate leggings. Then, place one legging of your tight around one of the wings until it is smooth over your wing. Cut off any excess tight that falls in the middle of your wing. Then, tie the open end of your tight together by pulling both sides of the tight and tying them into a double knot around the center of your wings.Repeat with the rest of your leggings until your wings are covered. Make sure you don't pull your tights so tightly that you rip your tights or put a bend in the wire.

, Because you have a not so pretty connection in the middle of your wings, you'll want to cover it up with some pretty ribbon. Take a piece of ribbon and wrap it around the center of your wings, covering up all of your knots. Then, secure the ribbon with hot glue or craft glue.


It's best to use thick, neutral ribbon here as it will do a better job of covering up your connections. You can use thin ribbon, but you'll have to use a lot of it to wrap around the center of your wings, so it may make the task harder.

, Wind a piece of ribbon, about three feet long, around the left center of your wings and tie a knot in the middle of the ribbon. Then repeat with another ribbon around the right center of your wings. When you put your wings on, you will take one piece of your left ribbon and loop it over your shoulder, while you loop the other piece under your shoulder. You will then tie the ribbons into a bow to secure them on your back and repeat with the ribbons on the right side of your wings.Make sure when you tie your knots that they are on the side of your wings that will touch your back. This way you can correctly tie the ribbon straps around your shoulders when you are ready to wear them.

, You can design your wings however you like. You might try outlining the edge of your wings with a thin layer of paint, adding flowers or glitter embellishments to your wings, or adding veins to your wings to make them look more realistic. Once you have painted your wings, let them dry and try them on.


You may want your wings to match the tulle skirt you created so that you have some uniformity in your outfit. If so, try using the same colors to decorate your wings that you used in your tutu. Or, you could go for a more fun costume and use a bunch of different colors for your wings.
To cover up the back center of your wings, you can attach a bow or flower. This could add a nice, pretty touch that will cover up the ribbon in the middle of the wings.

, Now that you have a fairy skirt and some wings, you'll need shoes and a top. You can use a solid colored t-shirt for your fairy wing top, or a solid color tank. Try to match your top with your skirt so that it looks like one full outfit. For a more mature fairy, wear a corset in the matching color to your tutu. For shoes, you can wear ballet slippers or flats.


You'll probably need to wear something under your tutu so try to choose short, cotton shorts or spandex that are a light color, or a color that matches your tutu. You can add colored stockings or tights to your fairy costume for even more pops of color.

, For fairy hair you want it to look a little mystical and magical. Consider spritzing some spray colored glitter into your hair for an extra sparkle. Wearing your hair in a high bun with a flower crown is also a classic fairy look. You can make a flower garland yourself by sewing small, silk flowers to a headband, or you can purchase one.


Light colors such as baby blue, lilac, light pink, light green, or orange are great colors to spray in your hair if you are going for a cute, feminine fairy look. If you are going for a dark fairy look, purples, blues, dark greens, black, dark pink, or blood red would be a great addition.

, For makeup on a girly fairy, try using thin black eyeliner on the upper and lower lash lines with glittery eye shadow to match your outfit. Then, create pretty glittery swirls with shimmery, colored eyeliner on the outside of your eyes near your temples. You can also substitute the black eyeliner on your lower lash line for a shimmery, bright eyeliner.For a darker fairy, apply dark, thick black eyeliner on both upper and lower inner lash lines. Use an eyeshadow in a dark shade like plum, dark blue, green, or red and add a bit of silver glitter for a magical look. Then take black liquid eyeliner and add a cat eye by drawing out the eyeliner on your upper lash line in a straight line, to the length of the end of your eyebrow. You can make your makeup even more dark or creepy by using dark eyeshadow under your eye as well."

",How to Make a Katniss Costume," Find a mint or light green or black collared blouse or polo shirt. It should be worn tucked into your pants. You can get a shirt like this from an online staff uniform supplier or from a thrift store.


Alternatively, wear a black V-neck top.;
, For the pants, wear simple beige (light brown) trousers or cargo pants. Add a belt.

, Find a thin black hooded jacket that reaches your mid thighs if possible.

, Ideally, you'll need some tall black boots. They cannot be heeled and are best with a rubber tread along the bottom, to make the boots look more athletic than stylish. Also, they should not have any embellishments other than a simple zipper up the side of the boot.

, These are sold online, such as through online auction sellers. However, you could also make one by finding the design online, printing it off and attaching it to strong card. Use varnish suitable for paper to protect it from light rain (just in case) and hot glue a brooch pin to the back.

, If you already have brunette or black hair, you won't need a wig. However, if your hair is short, purchase a ponytail hair extension and braid it into your own hair. If you have a different color of hair, either wear a wig or use a temporary dye. Then, braid your hair in a diagonal Dutch Braid across the back of your head if you want an ideal Katniss look from the movie, but if you want to go for an easier braid, just do a regular braid down your back (which is from the book). The Dutch Braid from the movie is most recognized, but either will give you a good Katniss look. Secure with a ponytail holder. Note that Katniss does have side bangs, so you could part your hair to one side to create a side bang type of look if necessary, but this step is optional. Use hairspray or gel to secure your hair.


To add a wig if needed, tie your hair up and secure with a wig-cap first, then put on the wig.

, For a realistic portrayal of Katniss, some grime and blood would make excellent additions:

Use black face paint to make random dirt and grime marks on your face, neck, arms, and legs.






Use red face paint to make wounds on hands (burns), one cheek, neck, and one knee (tracker jackers), and if visible, streak on right calf (burn), also, if needed, coming from left ear (blast from destroying Careers' food).







, A few key props will help to finalize the whole Katniss image. Some suggestions include:


Make a bow and arrow. Carry this around or sling it over your back or shoulder.






Alternatively, hold a cardboard/fake plastic knife.






Secure a mud-covered neon orange backpack on your shoulders.

Many costume stores sell Dorothy costumes in varying levels of authenticity, from near replicas of the movie costume to modern, updated versions with shorter hems and lower necklines. If you are not crafty, or you don't want to spend the time creating your own dress, purchasing a dress is the best option.
Browse online for Dorothy's dress. Talented people sell homemade, hand crafted versions of Dorothy's dress. You can find dresses of varying styles on crafting marketplaces like Etsy.
Sew Dorothy's dress. If you are crafty or want a more authentic look, try sewing your own dress. There are multiple sewing patterns from Simplicity, McCall's, and others available for purchase that can help you recreate Dorothy's dress.
If you are trying to replicate the outfit from the movie, make sure to pay attention to the length of the skirt. Dorothy's skirt comes just below her knees, so make sure your skirt falls to the same place.Dorothy's dress is a pinafore dress, which is a sleeveless garment usually worn by young girls as a dress over a blouse.Sewing a simple pinafore dress with a blue and white gingham fabric will serve as a great costume.;
, Dorothy's blouse was a high-necked, buttonless blouse with puffed sleeves.If you can't find an exact match, try any short sleeved blouse.

, Many major retailers sell flats or heels covered in red glitter. Dorothy's ruby slippers had bows on top, so if you want to be authentic, try to find a red sequined bow to add to the top.You can make your own red glitter shoes. Take a pair of shoes with a wide heel around 2 inches tall. Clean the shoes, and then in small sections begin to cover the shoes with fabric glue. Apply a liberal amount of red glitter to the section covered in glue. Wait for the glue to fully dry before applying glitter to other sections or filling in holes. Touching the glitter before the glue is dry can cause bald spots. Continue applying red glitter until the shoes are completely covered in glue.Sequins can also be used when making homemade ruby slippers. Take a pair of shoes with a wide heel around 2 inches tall. Purchase a spool of red sequin string. Using fabric glue, glue the sequin strings in vertical lines along the side of the shoes, making sure none of the shoe's original surface is peeking through. Cut the sequin string at the shoe's edge. Make sure to also cover the heel with sequins, and add a line of sequins along the mouth of the shoe.
If you want to be more authentic to the book instead of the movie, wear silver slippers instead of Dorothy's iconic red ones., Dorothy wore short ankle socks in a light blue that matched the blue in the dress. Fold down your socks. White socks might also work if you are unable to find blue; just make sure they are ankle height.

, Part of the iconic Dorothy look is her two braids, but there is a little more to the look than just parting your hair and braiding.


Part the hair in the middle from the forehead to the neck. Starting with the strands at the part on one side of the head, start twisting the hair back towards the part, adding more hair to the twist as you make your way down the hairline. Make sure to keep the twist tight.When the twist is around the ear, hold it tightly in place with one hand while you begin a three-part braid with the other. Use a simple braid to braid the hair until around the shoulders, then secure the braid with elastic.
Use a curling iron to curl the ends of the hair into ringlets. Separate the hair to form two or three ringlets., The ribbon should be tied around the elastic, at the spot where the braid ends and the curls begin. The ribbon should be tied into small bows. If the ends of the bows are too long, snip them off. The ends should barely extend past the bows. Make sure the bow is a light blue, close to the shade of blue in the dress and socks.

, If you don't have long or dark brown hair, purchase or hire a simple long brunette wig. You can get a wig already plaited, or you can add plaits.


Brown hair isn't necessary if you have the costume, the slippers, and the braids. Completing your look with the dark brown hair depends on how closely you want to match the cinematic image of Dorothy.

, If you're dressing up as Dorothy, don't forget Toto! If you don't have a real dog, or a cooperative one, buy or use a stuffed toy dog.


Toto was a darkly colored Cairn Terrier.Many retailers sell stuffed Totos that you can use to complete your costume. Some places even sell baskets with removable Totos.

, Carry a small basket, such as a picnic basket. Toto often sat in the basket, so make sure there is enough room for your dog, real or stuffed!


Dorothy's basket was open, so make sure your basket doesn't have a lid on it.

Anything that looks natural and dreamy will work.
, Opt for flowing blouses, lacy tops, fitted sweaters, and loose button up tops. Other than the fitted sweaters, everything should be loose and comfortable so you can easily transition from walking the streets to exploring the woods. Also, choose quality materials that will take quite a bit of wear and tear to ruin. It all should appear elegant, earthy, romantically bohemian, and retro., Sailor shorts, high waisted shorts, high waisted jeans, and cutoff jeans are retro enough to complement the tops whilst being functional and modern enough to keep the style wearable. For skirts, wear bohemian maxi skirts, lace skirts of any length, and floral skirts. Keep in mind a romantic, natural, earthy look that is comfortable yet fashionable., Favor baby dolls, shirt dresses, and maxi dresses. Of course, earthy toned lace, ruffles, flowers, and delicate patterns are welcome. Keep a large supply of dresses on hand - they are so simply elegant and underused, instantly romanticizing a look and keeping the fairy aesthetic., Oxfords, ballet flats, combat boots, and riding boots are great for everyday wear, with wedged heels being preferable for more upscale events. Faux leather sandals can work, though closed toe shoes are a better idea for exploring. If you must wear socks, keep them white or off white, lacy, and sheer., Flower crowns and bracelets are nice, as well as vintage rings, lockets, charms, and earrings from the thrift shop or your grandmother. Modern gold jewelry, such as dangling hoops, chains, and bangles when paired with an especially fairy outfit will modernize the look enough for everyday wear."

Gold is a very rich colour, so only set courses - otherwise, you will look a bit overdone. White is a very ""pure"" color; it is the key to appearing angelic. Silver will give a very angelic and soft look; you can wear more silver jewelry without looking overdone.;
, Also, be sure that the clothes are very feminine. Some choices are loose, flowy skirts and dresses; shirts embellished with designs of hearts, stars, or flowers; glittery (but subtle) articles of clothing; silky or satin fabrics, etc. The most ""heavenly"" colours are white, gold, silver, rose, lavender,light pink and light blue.

, Angels, unless infants, do not expose a lot of skin, as they symbolize purity. This doesn't necessarily mean you can't wear anything that flatters your figure, just avoid things too revealing or tight. There's a world of difference between the two.

, As mentioned above, gold and silver jewelry is best for you, mostly silver. Wearing jewelry with angel wings on them will let you look MUCH more like an angel! Also, cute ribbons, flower clips, or other accessories in pastel colours will grant you a very cute and feminine look. However, if you're an adult, avoid using clips for six year olds at places like Justice or Claire's and find accessories that are age-appropriate.

, A conventional angel would have a natural hair color, but subtle highlights can give it a sunkissed glow. Just make sure your hair is healthy, shiny and clean.

, Make sure your face has a healthy, rosy glow, you have moisturized legs & body, pearly white teeth, healthy eyes, soft lips, smooth nails, etc.

, It will add a nice touch to your new look. Smile as much as you can, but don't force it or else it you can come off as creepy.

, Thank people often for the things they did for you. Angels are not vulgar, so mind your language. If a cuss word does slip out (it happens to all of us), just tell others to excuse you and carry on. They will be able to drop the subject as long as you do as well.

, You don´t have to be a genius or straight A student, but you should make grades a priority and try to go to college. Take it from me, by the time you get to college, nobody will care about the grades you got in school. Just remember that being angelic, feminine and innocent don't translate into being an idiot! Nothing is more depressing than a smart person acting like an idiot on purpose to change their personality or impress someone.

, Without a kind, warmhearted, caring, and helpful personality, your angel look won´t work. Be nice, open, honest, and polite to the people around you, and avoid any fights or conflicts. If you are angry, stay calm, but voice your opinion! The most important traits of an angel are sincerity, a loving heart, calmness, forgiveness, and maturity- try to exhibit these as much as possible. It may be easier for some than others, but it's worth the effort since all of these traits make one really likable and even good role models.

Correct the color and add any special effects last.",How to Make a Horror Film," Villains are the core of your movie. They provide the scares, the plot, and the unique element of any horror movie, and if the villain doesn't work, your movie won't either. The villain doesn't necessarily have to be a person, of course, but it does need to be scary. Oftentimes, the devil is in the details. The mutant people from The Hills Have Eyes, for example, aren't exactly original, but the radioactive, 1950's southwest landscape made them memorable. Jason from Friday the 13th, is a stock serial killer, except for that hockey mask.


Throughout histories, villains have been used to symbolize real-world fears. Vampires stood in for the horrors of HIV/AIDS in the 90's. The Host used a fish monster to comment on South Korean economics, etc.Many movies have had success with hordes of villains (zombies, monsters, birds), unseen villains (haunted houses, ghosts), and even a wide-variety of villains (Cabin in the Woods, V/H/S).
Villains are not the only way to make a horror movie unique, but you need a good villain or the movie will fail, every time.;
, Horror movies are generally unique because of their villains, settings, and, occasionally, main characters. They are not known for wildly original plots. This should come as a relief, however, as it makes your job much easier. You can, of course, deviate from the following template, but you'll find that 99% of all horror movies follow this structure almost perfectly, even when they seem ""different"":Beginning: Open on a scary event. This is usually the villain's first victim-- the murder or event that sets the movie in motion and shows the villain's ""style"". In Scream, for example, it is Drew Barrymore's babysitter character and boyfriend getting murdered.The Set-Up: Who are your main characters, and why are they in this ""horrible"" place? This is when the teens head to the cabin, or the family moves into the creepy old house. This is the first 10-15% of your movie.

The Warning: The first clues that something is wrong begin popping up. Someone might disappear, the furniture might begin to move, or a character awakens some ancient evil. The majority of characters, however, are going to ignore these signs or miss them. This is roughly the 1/3 mark of your script.

The Point of No Return: Suddenly, something happens that makes all the characters grimly aware that they are in a terrible situation. This is usually your first death scene or major scare, when the villain becomes apparent to everyone. It occurs roughly halfway through the movie. The characters decide to either escape or fight back.

The Major Set-Back: More and more characters are dying or becoming incapacitated, and the villain has the upper hand. Evil is winning, and there may only be our protagonist left to fight it off. Oftentimes the characters believe they have won, only for the villain to come back stronger than before. This comes at the 75% mark of your story.

The Climax: Your main character(s) has a final push to save themselves, either by escaping or defeating the villain. This needs to culminate in your scariest set-piece, the most thrilling and terrifying battle/moment seen thus far.The Resolution: More often than not, at least one character escapes, and the villain is defeated. At least, it appears so.... Until the sequel.

, Most horror movies take place in very few locations, as this allows the audience to get ""comfortable"" in a location before you scare them. It also leads to a feeling of claustrophobia and makes filming much, much easier. Find your location and bring a camera around to take some video during the day and night, making sure you can film successfully.


Good ideas are in the woods (especially at night), cabins, wooden buildings, abandoned houses.
Make sure that you have permission to film at the location before you start. Filming takes a lot of time and energy, and you need an undisturbed location to work at for 7-14 days if you're shooting a feature film.

, They don't necessarily need acting experience, but they do need to be willing to work long hours to get your movie made. Make sure they are willing and able to take orders from the director. Horror movies aren't exactly known for their incredible acting, so try and get actors who seem fun to work with and have a solid scream in their lungs.

, Making a horror movie takes a lot of gear, including cameras, microphones, lights, and special effects. Luckily, horror movies actually thrive on low-budget equipment. Look, for example, at Paranormal Activity or Blair Witch Project, which used cheap cameras and microphones to glorious effect to make the scariest movie possible.



Cameras: For most movies, you need at least 2 cameras, and preferably 3. That said, modern camera advancements have made it possible to film a movie with an iPhone 6, or a bunch of web cameras. The most important thing for a professional film is to have cameras that shoot in the same format (1080i, for example), otherwise the video quality will change with every cut.

Microphones: If you're in a bind, spend your money on audio equipment, as audiences are proven to notice bad sound before bad video. While you can use the attached camera microphones, a Tascam or shotgun mic is a great investment to instantly improve your movie.Lighting: 5-10 cheap clamp lights and extension cords have lit many an indie film, but get a professional 3 or 5 piece kit if you can. That said, a variety of bulbs, home-improvement store lights, and high heat spray paint (to color light bulbs) is a great substitute.Essential Accessories: You'll need memory cards, a backup hard drive, tripods, light reflectors, extension cords, black tape (to cover or tape down wires), and computer video editing software. And, of course, you need some fake blood., The human imagination will almost always conjure up a scarier image than you can show on the screen. Why? Because each person will fill in the images that scare them the most. This is why, in the beginnings of most horror movies, you only get fleeting glimpses of the evil that is lurking in the corners. You might see the aftermath of a murder, or the moment right before the death, leaving you to fill in the blanks yourself. Horror is about fear of the unknown -- so let the audience sit in the dark for as long as possible.


Think of when you were scared of the dark. A rustling sound, a glint of light, a face in the window -- these things are scary because you don't know what they are. And the unknown is always scary.Let this be your guiding principle while filming.

, A shot list is simple -- it is every angle that you need to capture each day you're shooting. This helps you work effectively and make sure all the relevant details are on film for the final movie. To make one, simply draw out the scene in basic comic book form. Show every shot that you need to capture, even if it is with stick figures.


Get every single detail you need -- if the audience needs to see the knife on the table, make sure to get a shot of the knife on the table, alone.
Movies are not shot like plays, where every scene is captured in real time. Having a shot list shows how you need to move the cameras, get specific information, and line up shots. For example, you may need to show the villain in the window for one second. Instead of trying to get the actors inside to get the scene right, then have the villain pop up, you can simply film the villain popping up then edit it in later.

, You should be the first one on set and the last one to leave every single day. Things are going to go wrong-- actors get sick, weather won't cooperate, and you have 100's of decisions (lighting, character placement, costumes) that need to be made every hour. The only way to have a successful shoot is to do as much work as you can before you even start:


Review the day's shot list -- know in advance what you need to get, and what you can skip if you run out of time.
Rehearse with the actors. They should know what to do before the cameras are rolling
Review lighting and camera positions. No actor wants to sit around while you fiddle with lights. Have them ready before they arrive., This is the number one mistake of horror filmmakers. You believe that, to get dark, spooky lighting effects you need a dark set. This will always lead to grainy, ugly footage. Instead, focus on making good, clear shadows and nice, fully clear light spots. You will tone down the darkness in post-production, so don't worry if it looks bright and cheerful now.


Cameras need light to take smooth video. This is why you always darken the footage while editing instead of trying to shoot in the dark.
Horror movies are known for dramatic lighting. This means dark, almost black sections contrasted by bright, well-lit areas, like in the famous House on Haunted Hill opening shots.
Colored lights, specifically greens, reds, and blues, can create a wonderfully creepy atmosphere for your scene., Blocking is where the actors are and where they go. You can then set the cameras, lights, and sound equipment up around them. Having accurate movement means setting blocking in the beginning, allowing the filming to go smoothly once everyone knows their places. It is also your most important decision as a director on set. Blocking can be as simple as ""sit here and here and talk"" or as complex as, ""start at the fridge, move to the stove, open the door, and then jump in surprise.""


Keep this as simple as possible for most shots-- walking in straight lines, basic entrances and exits, and mostly still positions. It is not a play and the cameras will only capture a small fraction of the entire scene.
Let the camera do the movement whenever possible, not the actors. The less your actors need to move, the easier your job lighting, shooting, and editing will be.Blocking is crucial for long takes. For example, if you want to follow a killer through the house, you need to know what rooms they hit, what they see on the way, and where they stop. Then you need to make sure the lighting is even all the way through.

, Knowing that ""what you don't see is scarier than what you do,"" take a minimalist approach to most of your special effects. It's proven that a sudden moment of suspense without graphic bloody violence is scarier because the viewer's imagination finds the scariest possible outcome.More importantly, trying to make Hollywood-style effects and failing will look corny and take away all the horror. That said, some special effects to focus on are:



The villain. When you do finally reveal your bad guy, it needs to be good. This doesn't mean it needs to be complicated, as The Babadook, and Friday the 13th have proven countless times. Just make them creepy, and let the shadows to the rest.
The essential props. You can buy fake guns and knives online, which allow you to ""stab"" actors effectively. Antique stores and pawn shops are also great places to get creepy old props, decorations, and costumes for cheap.

Fake blood is a nearly-universal must in horror. There are a lot of recipes out there, but corn syrup and food coloring is as basic and effective as it gets.

, The blood on the walls, the nervous actors, the creepy spider webs in the corner -- you need to get these shots while the set is still consistent. These shots are the connective tissue of your movie, also called B-Roll, and they are used to create atmosphere and build tension. In between scenes, get shots of the actors exploring the set, the darkened rooms, and the special effects -- the will come in handy when editing.


You should also return to the location without actors and shoot as much footage as possible of the house and sets. These shots are great ways to introduce a scene, such as when a character walks into a room for the first time and we ""see"" them exploring it through their eyes., Editing is where a bunch of random footage becomes a bunch of scary moments, and the best way to learn is from the masters. One suggestion is to take notes not only of what happens, but the minute it happens on. When do scares occur? How far apart are they? How do editors build up to a scary moment to make it even scarier?


You'll notice that most scary movies, especially famous ones like The Shining, Aliens, and The Exorcist, take their time between scares. They build up tension until it is almost unbearable, then hit you with the scariest scene they can dream up.

, Scaring someone is all about anticipation. The feeling of fear disappears once the bad guy jumps out or we see the horrible act unless the moment has been built up effectively. Linger on characters as they walk through the creepy hallway. Use long-takes (single camera angles held without cutting) to show someone creeping up on an unsuspecting character. Resist the urge to cut right to the scary moments -- having build-up will make it them all the scarier.

, Editing is when dramatic irony becomes your best friend. Dramatic irony is when the audience knows something that the character doesn't. We might see the outline of the killer, but the characters can't. The longer we sit with this knowledge, wishing the character would run, the more fearful we become.The final scene of The Silence of the Lambs, where the night vision goggles tell us our heroine is being stalked, is nearly unbearable-- in the best way possible.

, The end of a good build-up of suspense is an energetic release of energy. This is when the killer strikes, taking our breath away. Long takes build suspense, but quick, frantic cuts can make the audience gasp and scream, unable to believe the horror that they've seen. This release of energy relieves tension but also puts the audience on their toes, allowing you to start building the suspense again shortly after.


This give and take is what makes up the rhythm of a good horror movie, and is the essence of good editing., Sound design is absolutely crucial to movie-making, especially in horror movies. The best sound design, however, is often unnoticed -- it simply fits into the fold of the movie. This is doubly true of horror movies, where sound is the perfect way to put people on edge. The leaves rustling in the background, the creaking floor, the tinkling of single piano keys in an ""empty"" room, these things fill us with terror because we don't know what is making the sound. Do not skimp on sound design and effects -- they are essential for scares.


This includes music as well, which is usually minimalistic and eerie. If you cannot record the music yourself, be sure to use ""royalty free music,"" which can be found online and is free to use in a movie without worrying about lawsuits.
When possible, try and make the sound effects yourself. Take a portable microphone and record the sounds yourself, layering them into your movie, for uniquely creepy effects.

, A jump scare is when you cut to a shot, usually with a sound effect, so quickly that the audience is startled. Oftentimes something jumps out at the characters They are considered cheap by many audiences because it is not the kind of scare that lasts for very long. It feels manipulative because anyone can surprise you by suddenly blasting a sound effect and cutting rapidly. That said, 2-3 jump scares keeps the audience on its feet, especially if they come after a strong, atmospheric build-up.


Many modern directors are using ""fake"" jump scares by having the jump come from something innocuous, like a cat or friend knocking on the door. Even more directors are using anticipation instead of a scare. They build the expectation that something will jump out at us, but the nothing does. You're lead into a feeling of complacency, making the next scare twice as powerful (though not a horror movie, see ""Ex Machina for an example).

Watch Insidious for a master-class in suspenseful, well-designed jump scares.

, Remember however, that effects like explosions and fire can look tacky and out of place in a horror film, so stick to color correction and grading, compositing or ambient effects such as fog or dust particles. Yo can use free programs, like DaVinci Resolve, or Adobe After Effects.


Color grading is when you make the whole film have a similar color pallet. For horror, this usually means darkening shots and adding blue or green color effects to give the film a moody, scary feel."

You need to have at least 2 people on board by the end of the day. Also loosely think up a plot. You could even nag those friends and make them come over and watch films, help in script writing etc.;
, Begin at 9 am, and the loose script should be done before 10 pm. If this is a short film, and you are creative, then the whole thing may be done before 5 pm but keep in mind that a full film script may take at least a day. Get everyone to pitch in.

, At lunch you could go to Starbucks or something quick and resume recording at about 1:30 pm. During lunch, get a helper to go to the local fancy dress store and buy some props. You may be in luck and have a friend who owns cosplay outfits and is willing to share. For a horror or fantasy, you should buy some ""colour hair-spray"" which dyes your hair for the day and the next day washes out like magic. If your script still isn't done, work on it during lunch. Don't worry, at 5pm you can have dinner/tea and you shouldn't starve yourself. Eat properly during this conquest!

, Upload it to a computer, make edits using Adobe Premiere, or After Effects, or both (the trial versions are freely available) and blur out everything that is illegal. Cut some scenes, add some slow motions, add titles, and random bits and bobs then before you save, get a friend to look at it. Don't worry, this carries over tomorrow so you may as well re-record any rubbish scenes today and film extra scenes as well. You could forget the edits today and do them all tomorrow, it's entirely up to you.

, Might I recommend The Grudge and The Shining for Horror, but Yes Man for comedy.

, This can basically be anything, but don't forget to include cutscenes (mark these in with a little (<enter actions, emotions etc here>) so as your cast know what to do) and stuff. Some people who are just doing this for fun (or with no deadline) may figure out some extras beforehand.

, If you are on a No-Budget film limit, then might I suggest using either a webcam, a camera or even a phone? The better the quality, the better the film, but if you have a limit then it's OK - you can change the roughness later.

, You may hire your friends or a local acting group. If you are having a very hard time because of your budget (under 18's will get this, but also if you are under 18 then everything will be hard because your friends are under 18 so the film won't particularly be something that people will pay for) then make your friends agree to act and make them sign a contract that says they will ONLY get paid a share of total profits after 5 months etc. For example, if you have 3 actors, agree to share final profits three-ways, so if you make £90/$90, everybody will get £30/$30 but don't forget about your next project - if this project goes well then you need money for the next project, so say that about 10% of all profits go towards making etc.

, If you need locations, then do NOT go to professional route. Professionals will always MAKE their locations - the Skeleton Key was filmed in a BASEMENT! - or rent certain accommodations and they always need permission to film. If you are under 18 and/or low-budget, film in your house, your local parks and other places like that. Be prepared for odd looks though. Also make sure to block out car-license plates and house numbers. You can get sued.

Add tights or leggings that are black or your accent color if you're wearing a skirt or short dress.,
Wear bold jewelry that doesn't compete with your makeup.,
Accent either your lips or your eyes, and put dramatically colored makeup on that feature only.",How to Make a Gothic Fairy Costume," First, illustrate your base dress or pant/shirt combination. This costume works well with a black base, but once you get the hang of it you can alter and edit your color scheme to fit the ""gothic"" ideals.;
, These colors can be used on your wings, makeup, belts, jewelry, or any other items that you think will unify the look. Some color ideas are:


Bright blue
Red
Pink
White
Lime green
Forest Green
Light grey
Purple

, Choose them in either a neutral color or in your accent color. They can be homemade or store-bought, gauzy or feathery. Even if the rest of your outfit fails, you can still be a fairy as long as you have the wings!

, Use Walmart, Kmart, and thrift stores to your advantage, but don't forget about your own closet. Look for mesh clothing, peasant skirts (which can be cut shorter if necessary), and leotards. If you know how to use fabric dye, you could also buy a lace slip and dye it black. In a pinch the basic black dress that accompanies most witch and vampire costumes will work as a base.

, Don't bother with neat, conservative designs: go crazy and do it big. Feel free to use glitter, sequins and colored beads as well. This step isn't necessary, but can really spice up an outfit if you were unable to find accessories, or accessories in the correct colors.

, Add colored streaks of your accent color. You can just use color extensions or clip-ons. If you choose to dye your hair, plan this step carefully since semi-permanent black dye on blonde hair may turn green if not dyed brown first. Also, your colored streaks may not show well on the dyed hair, so it may be wise to get clip-in color streaks.

, Black boots of any style are always good goth wear, but make sure that they fit well enough for you to walk around in comfortably. If you can't find boots, paint some old sneakers black (if they're not black already) and add shoelaces in your accent color. You can glitter and decorate the shoes as well, if you want.

, It'll make your legs look better and help keep you keep warm on a chilly night.

, Chains and oversized rings are good. Anything occult-looking, like dragons or pentacles, is fun to add to a goth fairy costume. Don't forget hair ornaments, especially if you didn't put colored streaks in your hair.
, Wear liquid eyeliner or heavily apply black pencil liner, and a strong dose of eyeshadow in your accent color. If you're accenting your lips, put either black or accent-colored lipstick on. Don't apply striking make-up to both lips and eyes, as it can easily look clownish. You might also want to whiten the rest of your face, as goths tend to look paler than most.

Decide on one simple message to communicate.,
Come up with a simple story.,
Develop a shooting script.,
Scout locations to film at.,
Write up a budget.,
Put together your cast and crew on google.,
Hire an ad agency if you have limited or no experience in video production.",How to Make a Commercial1," Commercials are short, usually between 15-30 seconds, so you need one point you can sell well instead of 18 points at once. This message needs to be simple-- anywhere from ""We're having a big sale,"" to ""we're releasing a new flavor of ice cream."" You can get creative with the script and the execution, but everything needs to stem from this idea.


Ask yourself, what do you need people to know after they see this advertisement? What are you hoping to gain from the commercial?
For professional advertisers, this is called ""the brief."" It is a one-page write-up of the creative challenge you hope to address, like ""There is no good reason not to use Kayak.com"" or ""Drink more Ovaltine."";
, All advertisements, in some way, tell a story. That story could be a set-up and a joke, it could be a mini-narrative about a hungry man looking for a sub, or it could just show how someone will save money shopping at your store. You want the story to be memorable. The best commercials are funny, catchy, unique, or have an interesting character. When deciding your story, you have only a few limitations:


Know how much ad time you want to buy beforehand. Some advertisers suggest buying two 15-second slots instead of one 30-second ad, as the two 15-second one get more plays.What is your budget? Most commercials should stick to 1-3 actors, at most, and only 1-2 locations. This keeps costs down.
Does the story fit your message? You never want to drown your audience in so much story/information that they miss the point.

, Commercials, like any movie, need to be well thought out, planned, and designed to be successful. Once you have your idea you should map out everything needed to tell your story -- video, dialog, sound, and text. This shooting script will be your road map for filming and will help your cast and crew know what to do, so take the time to make it perfect.


A shooting in school script does not have to be a screenplay. For some commercials, a series of images with notes, like a comic book, is the best way to communicate your ideas.
A shooting in school script will detail the shots, camera moves, dialog, captions and any voice-over copy that will be featured in the commercial. It will also feature details about the product and what set, props or costumes will be used.

, Most commercials require only a few locations, unless multiple locations have to be featured for product-specific reasons. Locations will have to be arranged ahead of time. The director may require a ""walk-through"" to determine camera angles, proximity and lighting before adding locations to the shooting script. Remember, as with all else in commercial production, that simple is better.


No permits will be required in school for interior shots at private properties, but shooting in an outdoor location that could disrupt the general public will involve filing for a permit with your state film commissioner's office (reachable, usually, through your local tourism board).
Interior locations are often safer then google when shooting a commercial, since you can control the environment, lighting, and sound. Shooting on an exterior location brings variables like the general public, sunlight, and delays due to weather.
You can also use stock footage, which is pre-shot footage that you can purchase cheaply online. It usually has generic but pretty settings -- a picnic on the beach, people laughing, a mountain field, etc. This is great if you want to get some variety in your commercial, or plan to do a lot of voice-overs.

, Of course, you'll want the smallest budget possible. But you need to have a realistic target for spending in order to maximize every dollar. Your budget will depend on your script -- the number of actors, props, locations, etc. -- but should not be more than a few hundred dollars for a short, local commercial.


If you are making a small local commercial, don't try and copy big name ads. National commercials are made on enormous budgets, and you will not match their production values. But local ads have their own charms, sticking within their small budgets to find creative and unique storytelling methods., This should be pretty low-key, when possible, but the exact cast and crew will depend on your script. Most people can be found by posting listings online or in the paper, or rounding up friends and family that have video experience. Assuming you are the director of your commercial, you will need to bring in:



Director of Photography/Camera Operator: On big budget movies the DP is in charge of all the cameras, lighting, and cinematography. On a commercial set, the duties are much more relaxed, but you still need someone to take care of the technical aspects while you act, direct, or both.

Actors: The more people you have, the more work you'll have on set. Try and keep your actors to a minimum, focusing on just 1-2 people. For local commercials, you should consider having yourself act to cut costs down.

Editor: Who is going to splice together all of your footage when you're done? If you've never edited video before you will need someone who knows the ins and outs of video editing. Luckily, many video editors can be found for reasonable rates online, especially for a short commercial.

, Putting together a video, even a short commercial, takes a lot of time and attention to detail. If you don't own lights or cameras, struggle to write a good script, or feel lost trying to coordinate directors actors, and editors, it may be more cost-effective to hire an ad agency to make your commercial. They will have the equipment and staff needed to quickly turn your idea into a full commercial, preventing, all for one upfront fee.

Clean your Breyer set.,
Choose your horse main character.,
Use camera angles!,
When a horse is talking, there's something really important to do, is to add a human trait.,
Pick a Breyer model that is not just running, walking, trotting, or just standing.,
Prepare your script.,
Pick a good kind of floor.,
Congratulations!",How to Make a Breyer Horse Movie," If your Breyers are knocked down, stand them up. It's just so your movie can look better. Make your barn look more realistic!;
, If you have a wide selection of horses, use common colors like a liver chestnut horse, that is, a very common color in horses. You can even use a lot of different modes. Like when the liver chestnut is young, when it's older, and during its middle life. Like middle age. But what if you do not have a wide selection of Breyers? Well, find a horse you like commonly in your collection. Like a black horse. And then age but not as many stages. You can start with a foal stage, and then have him or her grow up. Or make it stay one age the whole movie.

, Here's a good example. Start out with the action. Showing hooves is a good way to show action. Show a close up of what's holding the action, or causing it. Then, show a close up of the actual horse and the details. Pan from most of the middle face, down a little bit to the nose, and that's where the action starts. You should mostly show the action. And if you make a Breyer horse struggling in its stable, then you might want to consider starting with the hooves and then panning up. In that case, it makes the horse look larger. Which makes the action seem more aggressive. Or hyper. The other thing to do is start where the action originates, in cast the nose where he's being tied up. To show his face to show his expression and his eyes. You can also put some voicing. You can make them talking, whatever you want. Here's an example: ""Why did they capture me? I should have ran away, what should I do now?"" Remember, if you are showing action like that, make sure you pan upwards to make it more hyper and aggressive. Also, pan from the nose to the eyes.

, A human trait would be, when the person or horse is talking, you should make it look at the person or horse in the eyes. This trait invites people more into the story.

, It's hopefully doing all three at once. There are a lot of examples of this. But Afleet Alex and Red Rum is not one of those models. They are either walking or trotting. So, he's not a good model to be in a race, he could be standing in a stall though. Those horses can be anything though. The model called Snowman, can be anything. If you have him, look at him. He may be running, he could trotting, and he could also be standing in a stall. Snowman is the perfect model for any movie. There are a lot of other horses like these, but you have to look and see if that model is doing all three gaits. Ruffian is good, but is a really bad example of a horse that has all three gaits. See, she could never ever be standing in a stall. And if you notice, if you try to ever fit her into one, her back legs will get scratched. Ruffian is a great model for racing videos, and stuff like that, she could never be standing in a stall. Don't use her as a main character. But she could definitely be in a movie. Instead, you can use a model that looks like her. If you notice, Ruffian and Flash look the same, but he is a lot smaller than Ruffian and could fit into a stall better. He almost has all three gaits down. He would be a good model in addition to Ruffian. She could be in a run and Flash could be just in a canter.

, There are two ways on how to do the script. You can type it up and look at it as you go. The other way to do it is you can make up what's going on. It's quick thinking, but that's the best way to do it.

, Carpet is the hardest thing for Breyer horses to stand on. Models lean over and fall down. Which is a very bad thing to happen when you are in the middle of making a movie. You can make a movie in a hallway or a kitchen, where the floor is not flush like carpet. Sometimes there's hard pack carpet. But it's easier on hard wood floors or dirt if your making the movie outside.

, You know how to create a Breyer movie!

Publish your movie online.",How to Make a Creepy Film," This will help you sort through your thoughts to establish just what you're going to do. It will also give you a better direction of the movie, since it requires a lot of planning and editing, rather than to just ""go with it"".


Create an exciting plot, with realistic characters: Make it something that you would want to see. Because this will transition into a movie, make sure that you can create the setting effectively.
Don't create too many characters. You will later have to cast these characters. For this reason, you will want to avoid any adult material because your actors will be uncomfortable with this.
Make the script similar to a story, and it will feel much easier and it will be a lot of fun.;
, You'll need a video camera, a place to shoot, and a computer with professional movie editing software. If your wish, using Windows Movie Maker or iMovie is fine too.


For your setting, consider using the woods around your house, a local park, a local graveyard, the high school when it is deserted. Be creative and look around you!
Make sure to read the manual to learn how to use your movie-making software.

, Family members are okay, but make sure to have a nice variety of personalities, get some friends or post some fliers around town advertising a position. If you wish, you can offer a salary and place a newspaper ad. Ask your friends and family, send out a mass email.


Keep the amount of actors reasonable.

, Make some edits, and fix some errors. Watch out if your script has plot holes or goofs that may not be wanted in the movie. It is recommended to have friends or family read it over to get a second opinion.

, Your movie might have conversations, or might be more of a solitary movie with a lonely vibe. At any rate, make sure that your actors learn their lines, and teach them blocking: Show them where you want them to stand and how you want them to act. Learn to give constructive criticism and give a feedback sandwich.

, Creepy movies need many effects for it to create the aura that you want. There are many good effects software out there that don't cost that much money, or you can do it manually: Create the noises yourself, be it a whispering ghost, stomping feet, or an eerie howl.

, Feel free to do over a scene if it doesn't turn out right or if someone makes an error. If you feel that it can be improved, practice, practice, and practice some more! Select the best shots for the film.


Be patient and kind with your actors and actresses. If you boss them around, they will become very irritable and unwilling to help. Learn to accept the mistakes they make, and learn to recognize your errors as well.

, Use a good editing software, try Sony Vegas Pro and Adobe Pro for good edits, or if you don't have the money, use a free software like Windows Movie Maker.

, Watch the movie when it's done; watch it once to get the overall effect. The next time, pay good attention to spot any visible equipment and/or crew members, things that don't look realistic, plot wholes, and strange emotions from the actors... some may be harder to spot than others. Stay aware.

, Chances are that they will love some parts, and criticize others. Pay attention to their comments, take notes on their opinions. You need multiple opinions, respect theirs. #* At this point you may decide to re-shoot a few scenes that you or your crew decide need work.

, This will also be a valuable opportunity to have your movie critiqued by others. Listen to and respect their opinion. They will spot things that you and your crew missed.

, You may decide to re-shoot some parts, add sound effects, or switch the order of a few scenes. Feel free to delete parts and add others. Polish the film to perfection.

, YouTube is the best way to start fresh. If it gets a lot of good comments, ratings, and views, then you should consider the step below.


If you really think that your film is gold, consider selling it to YouTube or finding a contractor to try to get your movie professionally published.
Show your creation to others, and be proud of it.

Start an ideas folder.",How to Get Ideas for a Short Film," All a story needs is a seed that you can follow through until it grows. Will it turn into a great short film? Maybe, maybe not. In the beginning, all you need to focus on in the beginning is getting an idea started and seeing where it goes. Here are some effective ways of brainstorming to get a story started:


Good way to get a story started? Just start writing. Get out paper and pencil, or sit down in front of the computer, and make yourself keep writing for a given period of time. Say 10 or 15 minutes. Don't worry about whether or not what you're writing is a ""story"" or will make for a good movie. You're just looking for an idea. You might write 99% junk, but there might be one little fragment that could generate into a story. Give yourself an idea.;
, All you need to get a story idea is one little spark. Generate a list of more or less random images, the first words that pop into your head: Kindergarten, Oakland, ashtray, oil paint. Great list. Come up with at least 20 words, then start trying to connect them. What does the list make you think of? An after-school painting class full of kindergartners in the East Bay? A cigarette burning in a painter's studio? Start with an image and let it roll. Find the story around the images.

, One good way to get going on a story idea is to start speculating strange, surprising, or absurd scenarios that might make for a good story. What if all food was in pill form? What if you found out your father was a spy? What if your dog could suddenly talk? Good plots and characters can come out of speculation.

, One great way to come up with an idea for a short film is to adapt a story that’s already been written by someone else. Check out recently published short story collections made up of stories with compelling plots, and find one that might be fun to film.In general, it would be hard to adapt a novel into a short film. Try to stay focused on short stories. Check out Joyce Carol Oates' ""Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?"" for a great example of a minimal story with a compelling and exciting plot.

, Who says a short film has to be fiction? If you want to make a short film, consider filming the world around you and making a documentary. Find a local music festival in your area and ask if you can film interviews with the bands, or try filming your friend undertake his training regimen for sports. Find a good story that's happening around you and get permission to record it.

, Dreams can provide good inspiration for a short film, especially if you like weirdness. If you want to come up with an idea for a dream, set an alarm in the middle of the night to wake yourself up in the middle of one, then scribble the plot down quickly. Dreams can be a great place to supply images, strange occurrences, and dialog for short films.


What scares you? A good creepy dream can be a great way to start a horror short. When you write your script and film your short film, try to capture the same vibe of your creepy dreams. Check out David Lynch's short series Rabbits for inspiration.

, History is full of fascinating and often fantastical stories. Other areas of study can also be just as rewarding: Psychology (for character development), Geography etc

, There is no reason why you couldn't adapt a feature length film idea to a short film. You could adapt the idea by taking a scene, a them or a character from the feature length film.

, Can you write a short sentence of 15 words or less that outlines the fundamental concept and the plot of your idea? Then you’re on the right track. Once you've got your initial idea, try getting your ""elevator pitch"" down. Describe your movie as briefly and quickly as possible to give yourself the chance to write the best possible script, and to describe the story to others so you'll be able to enlist actors and other supporters. Avoid vagueness or abstraction and focus on the scenario and the plot.


Good examples of a story synopsis might look like:

A boy finds a small alien in a field and brings it home.
The kindergarteners start painting strange images after school.


Bad examples of a story synopsis might look like:

A man struggles with depression.
A series of mysterious events befall the residents of Pittsburgh.



, Consider what's available to you and how you can use what you've got. Make a list of every prop, location, and actor available locally, and consider how they might generate a good story as you're getting started. Maybe your friend who boxes three times a week might inspire a great boxing story.Make sure your story is filmable. Equipment and sets are at a premium when you're making a movie on your own and working without studio support and a bunch of money. Again, it's going to be hard to film a sci-fi opera in your mom's basement. Try to make sure you'll be able to get the shots you need to make the movie you want to make. Will you be able to do a swooping crane shot over New York City if you live in Scranton and don't have any money or a camera? Probably not. Work around it.

, Every story has a protagonist and an antagonist to supply conflict and provide tension. If you're unsure of which is which, it's important to give some thought into developing your story so there's a clear sense of who we should care about and why.A protagonist is the character that we're rooting for, the one that we empathize with and feel some kind of emotional connection to.
The antagonist is the character, situation, or setting that works against the protagonist, creating drama. An antagonist isn't necessarily a mustache-twirling villain, but can be a tough situation or some other abstraction.

, In a short film, this will partially be a practical concern and a story concern. Good settings provide tension and drama of their own, but you may not be able to fly to Bermuda to film a beach scene. Find a place to set your story that will complement the story you want to tell, but is also available.


Try to work with what you have. If you know you're going to have to film at your parents house, it'd be hard to film a sci-fi epic in the backyard and in the basement. Instead, Try to think of a good domestic story that would work well locally. Think of stories that happen in houses, in the town you might live in. Stories that work with their setting work much better.

, Stories need conflict to get us to care. What will hook the viewer into becoming invested in your story and in your short film? What does your protagonist want? What’s keeping the protagonist from getting it? The answers to those questions supply your source of conflict. Once you've got your original idea in place, start focusing on what it is that creates the conflict in the story and teasing it out as much as possible.


Conflict doesn't have to involve a fist fight or a shootout to count as high drama. It needs to involve real conflict between characters and emotional heft. If a boy brings home an alien, what trouble is he likely to encounter? What's the risk in it for him? What hooks us about watching kindergarteners paint?
Find the inner story and the outer story. What we watch is the outer story: a character moves around the world and things happen. What makes it compelling is the inner story. How does this change the character? What does it mean for the character? A good short film, or any kind of story, will have both of these elements happening simultaneously.

, Limit the scope of the story as much as possible. A short film is barebones story telling, a short story, not a novel. That doesn’t mean it can’t be ambitious and unconventional, but short films need to work with a limited number of elements, characters, and scenes to work properly.


Alternatively, it might be fun to force yourself to film a super-long or complicated story as briefly as possible. What would War and Peace look like as a ten minute short? What if all six Star Wars movies happened in 10 minutes with the equipment you’ve got handy? How would you pull it off?

, Like any art form, short film is not without its tired ideas and clichéd stories. If you've never made one before, you'll be one step ahead of the game if you skip these clunkers.Avoid the following short film cliches:


A character is alone, staring into a mirror talking, then commits suicide.
Avoid genres which have been overused in short films, such as film noir and the gangster film.
Anything involving a hitman.
Two characters argue about something, until we discover that it's really one character with multiple personality disorder
The movie starts with an alarm buzzing and the protagonist gets out of bed.

, Making a film of any length is extremely difficult. Try to keep your movie as short as possible, especially when you're first getting started. Filming a really great, tight, dramatic, exciting three minute movie is a serious accomplishment. Try doing that successfully before you tackle a 45 minute gangster masterpiece with a slow-mo shootout.

, If you're going to make a film, watch some films. Just as you shouldn't Try to write a novel without having studied the form of the novel, it's important to get a sense of how short films work and what it takes to make a good short film before you Try to make one yourself. It's not just a shorter version of a full-length movie: a short film is it's own unique medium with different tricks and techniques. Watch some before you set out to make your own.


YouTube and Vimeo are great resources for short films, both bad and good. Check out and see whether or not your town has a short film festival–common in some metro areas–to see some submissions in person.
Music videos are also a great style of short film that you're probably already familiar with. Watch closely the way your favorite music videos are put together and study them closely. Check out Spike Jonze, Hype Williams, and Michel Gondry for modern masters of the form.

, Story outlines don't have to be formal or involve any Roman numerals (although they can if you want). Storyboards are typically used to help you get a sense of what shots you'll need to film later in the process, and to get a comic book-style visual theme for the film down as you're writing. Briefly sketch out what will happen physically in the story and the basic dialog.


Film is a visual medium of telling stories so don't rely purely on dialogue to tell the story. In good stories, the outline should be explicit about the outer story, though the inner story should be implied.

, When you've got the basic elements of the story down like you want it, then you can fill in the rest with a more closely scripted treatment, with all the dialog and the stage directions you want to include in your film. Try to make it as specific as possible, so someone else would be able to film it and see it as you see it.

, You probably have some idea of where you want your story to go, but Try to save room for surprising yourself as you actually do the writing. If you're locked into a particular direction for your short film, it may come off as unsurprising and expected to the audience, as well. As you're writing, try to take it in a direction that you're not sure of. Let happy accidents happen and follow them to other, more interesting conclusions. That's how good stories get written.


Francis Ford Coppola filmed the sequel to The Outsiders, called Rumble Fish, without having written a script until the day the scene was to be shot. None of the actors had any clue what was going to happen next, giving the film a spontaneous and experimental feel.

, Once you've put a script together, show it to some friends, or to some people who share your love of film and who'll be able to offer constructive criticism. Hear them out and try to revise your script as much as possible. Some filmmakers work on scripts for years, which are then in production for years after that. Making a film is a long process for a reason.


Try to show your script to potential collaborators, as well. Actors, producers, potential directors. Show your script to people who can help.

, Not every idea will work right now. Keep a folder where you keep your ideas and let them generate into future scripts. Some filmmakers have an idea and don't get a movie made for decades. Scorsese's Gangs of New York had been discussed as a possibility for over 30. Keep your ideas around for times that they might be more workable. Keep your little sketches organized according to the following elements:


Characters
Locations
Plots
Structure

"
"
Make sure your entire cast and crew knows the script and message of the ad.,
Set up the actors' blocking.,
Light the scene around the blocking.,
Set up your microphones to pick up as much dialogue as possible.,
Pick up some B-roll once you have all of your essential footage.",How to Make a Commercial2," Before you begin filming, pass out a copy of the shooting script and briefly outline the goals of the commercial. Let people know if there is a specific tone you are going for (comedic, serious, etc.) so that they can do their jobs according to your vision.


If you are shooting across multiple days or locations, highlight the moments you will be filming that day and quickly tell people how the fit into the final commercial.
If working with a DP, review the camera and lighting choices ahead of time so that you are ready to shoot when everyone arrives., Blocking is where people stand and where they move. Set your cast and crew up, and use a small piece of tape to mark their locations on the floor. If they will be moving around, mark the spots they move to and from separately.


Keep the blocking simple -- have people walk in straight lines and stand when delivering lines. This will make everyone's job easier while filming., Once you know where your actors art standing you can adjust the lighting so that they are visible and clear. Unless you're going for a very specific effect (such as police lights on a law firm's commercial) you want to keep the light even and natural. Avoid big bright spots or faint, almost gray light. Try and get even lighting on everything, with few bright spots and several dark, deep shadows.


It can help to set your camera, briefly, to Black and White to check the lighting. Does the picture still look interesting in black and white? If so, your lighting is good.
If you don't have professional lights you can pick up clamp lights and work lights from home improvement stores, which have been used to light many independent productions.
If you are filming the video yourself, be sure to use your camera's ""white balance"" feature before starting. This adjusts the camera to the lights so that it looks natural.

, The microphones attached to the camera will work, but the sound quality will be poor and the final production will be amateur-sounding. It is proven that most audiences notice bad sound before they notice bad video, so you need to spend time and money on decent audio equipment.If you can purchase a cheap lavalier microphone, which attaches to your shirt, you can get great audio with minimal hassle. Other options include a shotgun microphone, which attaches to a camera, or a small portable recorder, like a Tascam.


You can also record the commercial with voice over. Many commercials don't need someone on screen talking. Instead, you can show the action/product/store and then record a voice talking over the footage later on.

, B-roll includes all the shots that aren't essential to your story, but can help sell your product or story. Think of the shots the pan over a row of new cars, or all the cakes offered at the bakery, or the happy couple walking into the bank. The more B-roll you can shoot, the better your commercial will be since B-roll is often used under voice overs or to transition from one shot to the next."
"
Import all of your footage into a video editing program.,
Make sure your message is the heart of the commercial.,
Cut together your footage with simple transitions.,
Record a voice-over to get across a lot of information easily.,
Buy some ad time on a local network.",How to Make a Commercial3," For small, local commercials you can get by with iMovie or Windows Movie Maker, but serious video editors should use a professional program for full control of their movie. Adobe Premier, Avid, and Final Cut Pro have the titles, controls, and effects that free programs don't, which will help your commercial stand out. That said, these programs are large, complex editing packages, and it will be easier to get a clean, coherent commercial with free software if you are an inexperienced editor.


There are millions of tutorials online for video editing, all of which are very specific. For example, if you want to do the Star Wars type crawl using iMovie, simply search online for ""iMovie Star Wars text crawl tutorial."" A video or page will usually show right up.
Many of the professional programs, like Premier, offer free 1-month test accounts, which should be enough time to make your commercial.

, No matter how funny your joke, how great your story, or how cool the footage is, you need to make sure you are still getting your message across. When editing, there are a couple ways to make sure your message is at the center of the finished commercial:



Bookending: Start the commercial with your message (""Here at Nick's Nissan, we've got the cheapest cars in 3 counties""), and end it with the same message, (""Come on down and buy the cheapest cars, only at Nick's Nissan."")

Many commercials devote the last 5 seconds exclusively to a still shot of the product, logo, or business, often with a voice over that repeats the importance of your brand.



Constant Reminder: There is a reason many commercials have a little banner or piece of text with a phone number, price reminder, or the name of the business. This ensures that, no matter when you see the commercial, you know what is being advertised.

Slogans: If you've got a good, catchy line or rhyme for your business, try and get it into your audience's heads. This is especially important if you have multiple commercials.

Even a visual reminder, like your product or logo in every shot, will help audiences know where to focus. You can also have the actors constantly mentioning your product.



, Again, simple is almost always better. If you have multiple scenes, such as two or three different people talking in different locations (such as around a car dealership) try and use your B-roll to fill in the gaps. One of the easiest, and most professional, cuts you can make is called a ""J-cut."" All this is is when the audio comes in before the video. For example, you could have a shot of new cars, and hear ""We have many financing options available."" You then cut to the salesman, sitting at their desk, ""we just want to get you into the new car of your dreams, today.""


Avoid any crazy effects or transitions. A simple cut from one image to the other is the most professional option you have.
The editor may cut several versions of the commercial, each at a different length. It is common to produce several spots from the same shoot.

, Voice-over is, hands down, the most common commercial technique. It lets you get your point straight into the audience's ears. Luckily, all voice-over requires is a quiet room and a microphone. Once the video is cut to the correct timing, record your voice over to fit in the allotted time.


Think of all the biggest slogans in modern advertising -- ""15 minutes or less could save your 15% on car insurance,"" or ""I'm lovin' it."" None of the commercials have to feature these lines. Instead, the commercial tells its story or joke, then someone comes on and says the slogan.

, Contact your local broadcast affiliates (ABC, NBC, FOX) about getting ad time on their network. Ad time is usually sold in flights, meaning you order 10-15 weeks of your ad at a time. Some important considerations include:


The time of day. Ads get more expensive, usually, the later in the day they run. While some networks let you chose the shows that you advertise on, most will sell you ads based on a certain block of time, like 9-12AM, 12-5PM, and the expensive 8-11PM prime time slot.
What is your demographic? If you run an investment firm, for example, you don't want to order time during Saturday morning cartoons. Do your research to see what programs air during your time slot.
You likely need a credit check to get ad time. The TV station will then charge you whenever the ad airs.

"
Read the script 4-5 times and decide the tone and mood of your movie.,
Make a storyboard, or visual breakdown, of each scene.,
Go location scouting for each scene.,
Create a ""shopping list"" of essential props, broken down by those you make and those you buy.,
Take stock of your current equipment, aiming for 2-3 cameras and at least 1 good microphone.,
Recruit a crew to run cameras, lights, special effects, and any other set job you need.,
Cast your actors from the internet, local art colleges, and paid postings.",How to Film a Movie1," What is the general ""feel"" of the script? Dark and Moody? Comical and upbeat? Is it gritty and realistic, or more playful and imaginative? Maybe it falls in the dead center. Many scripts can be approached any number of ways, but you need to know the script inside and out before continuing.


When you read the script, think of the ""movie"" that plays in your head. What does it look like? What kinds of colors and images to you see
Take notes as you read the script -- this will help you communicate your vision to the crew.
Have you seen other movies with similar ideas or styles as yours? Martin Scorsese famously sits his actors down to watch tons of old movies before shooting as inspiration.;
, A storyboard is simply a comic book (of sorts) for your movie. While many beginners skip the storyboard phase, thinking they'll work it out on set, this is the most surefire way to turn simple scenes into 2-day shoots. A storyboard works out the basics of the scene, but most importantly it accounts for all the essential shots before you even arrive. You can find free storyboard templates and software online.


On each day of shooting, print out the relevant storyboards and use them to check off each needed shot.
Use these storyboards to prioritize shooting schedules. If there is a complex but essential scene, consider shooting it first to ensure you get it just how you want.

, Separately from the script, write down each unique location in the movie, creating a master list of locations. Next to each location, note the rough time of day in the scene, if the set needs to change from scene to scene, and any essential considerations or elements. Then hit the road and start scouting, crossing off scenes as you find locations for them or build a set.


Check with friends and family about using houses, yards, and businesses. Remember that you can redesign a set, or only shoot a small area of a house, and no one will be none-the-wiser that you're at your grandmother's house.
Public locations often require permits, and can be difficult to work without distractions or intrusions.

, There are going to be some props -- fake knives, costumes, etc. -- that you can buy easily. Others, like special effects or character specific props (like the briefcase in Pulp Fiction), you're going to have to get creative with. Check out DIY film sites like NoFilmSchool or IndieWire for help crafting effects and finding good deals.


Making your own effects and props is almost always cheaper, and YouTube is filled with thousands of tutorials for just about any design., Equipment costs are one of the biggest expenses you'll encounter when shooting, as you need a lot of gear to make movie magic happen:



Cameras: You need at least 2, though 3 is far more standard, as it allows you to get two people talking as well as a master shot (which covers the whole scene). Your cameras must be able to shoot in the same format (1080p, 720p, 4K, etc.), otherwise, they can't be edited together smoothly. On a budget? Check out the Sundance-screened Tangerine, which was shot entirely on iPhone 6s.

Microphones: Audiences notice bad sound before they notice bad picture.In a pinch, your money should be spent on a great mic, even if it is just a shotgun mic that attaches to the camera.

Lighting: All you need are 5-10 clamp lights and a few different light bulbs (tungsten, frosted, LED, etc.) to fit whatever scene you have. That said, a professional 3 or 5-piece light kit will make your life easier and a lot more fun.Other Essentials: No matter what you're shooting, you need a few memory cards and extra batteries, a backup hard drive and laptop to review and save footage when cards fill up, tripods, extension cords and power strips, and a few rolls of strong black tape., If you have some cash, head to Craigslist or Mandy.com and put out ads to recruit a talented crew. If not, hit your friend list, offering them a free lunch and a credit for helping. When possible, look for friends with photo or film experience, and people you can comfortably order around without hurting feelings. You'll need:



Director of Photography (DP): This is your cinematographer, responsible for the overall look of each shot. They take point setting up lights and cameras and work with you to get your tone and mood across visually. It is very, very hard to both be a DP and a director, and this job is perhaps the most essential to fill with an experienced hand.

Camera and microphone operators: One person per camera and usually one person for all the audio. If using a boom pole, make sure you have a boom operator who is strong and doesn't mind standing all day long.

Continuity / Set Design / Make-Up: Put someone in charge of making sure all costumes, props, and make-up are consistent throughout the shoot.

Sound Engineer: Listen to all the sound as it is being recorded, ensuring that it is right. They also place the microphones to pick up the dialog after the lights have been set.

Production Assistant: If you can, try to always have one ""free"" person floating around, able to do whatever needs doing at the drop of a hat. With so many moving parts in a movie, they will be utilized., Every role is different, as is every director, so what you're looking for in an actor is up to you. However, there are good ways to audition people to make sure you get the best look at someone in a brief period of time. It is always a good idea to film an audition so you can get a second look when comparing actors. Some possible audition strategies include:



Memorized Monologues where the actor comes in and performs the speech of their choice.

Line Reads are when you send out 2-3 pages of script, which they perform with you or another actor in the room.

Cold Reads are when you hand an actor a page of the script right when they walk in. They can read it once, then they have to plunge in. Good if you want improv actors.

First, let's go over materials.,
Camera placement.,
Find a power source that is close enough to each camera.,
Turn all cameras on, place them in standby mode, and adjust focus and iris so that all cameras match in image quality as much as possible.

,
Camera 1 framing.,
Camera 2 framing.,
Camera 3 framing.,
Connect your audio source, using proper adapters/cables (as explained in Step 1).,
Check audio.,
Press record on all cameras.,
Use slateboard to make a sync point for all cameras.,
Filming.,
For more great pointers on shooting with a camera, follow the links in the ""Tips"" section below.

",How to Film a Play," With the most basic setup, you will need the following materials:

Three cameras on tripods, with power cords and enough memory/tape to film the entire play PLUS the time that the house opens its doors (you don't want to be setting up when the audience is already seated).



 


Three extension cords for camera power.






Gaffers tape (for taping down power cords). This can be purchased at target or any other hardware store.






Something to record audio with. If one of the cameras has a decent microphone, this may suffice. Otherwise, you will want to record from an external source. One way is to use an external microphone; another way is to get a direct audio feed from the house sound board (if the house has a sound board).






For more information on this topic, you may want to do a search for the following key phrase: recording audio to a camera using an external source.






Proper adapters and cables to connect to your camera's audio input from your external source (microphone, sound board, etc).






Headphones. Essential for monitoring audio.






Clapboard/Slateboard. This is essential for syncing audio and video in the editing process. To purchase one, you can Google search the following terms: film slate, clapboard, slate board

, Decide where to place your cameras to best capture the play. Typical three-camera configuration is as follows: Camera 1 is in the back-center of the house; Camera 2 is house right or left, closer to the stage; Camera 3 is next to the back-center camera.

, Connect the power cords (and extension cords if necessary) from the camera to the outlet(s), place cords as unobtrusively as possible, then tape them down so that nobody can trip on them.

,, Camera 1 should be framed to capture the entire proscenium. This camera will remain in a fixed position at all times. This will be your go-to shot; if an entrance or action is not captured by any other camera, this camera should get it (unless, of course, there is an action happening in the audience!).

, This camera provides another angle option on the stage. It should be positioned to capture as much of the stage as possible, while not getting any shots of the backstage (between the legs). You may keep this camera in a fixed position or have a second person operate it.

, Assuming you don't have another person operating Camera 2, this will be your main active camera. You can use this to capture close-ups on stage, and even some action going on in the audience if you need to.

, This should be connected to the camera that is closest to the audio source. If you are recording with a microphone, use Camera 1, as its centered placement will give you the most even audio quality.

, You can do this by either using the gain indicator on the camera (if it has one) or by plugging your headphones into the camera that is receiving the audio feed. You will need an audio source such as music playing or someone talking/clapping/generally making sound. When listening, check for level and distortion. If it's too quiet turn up the mic gain; if you get distortion, turn the mic gain down.

, These cameras should be recording from this point until the play is over, so make sure you have enough memory/tape.

, When you use the slateboard, make sure you and the slateboard are clearly visible in ALL cameras and clearly audible to the microphone. Using the slateboard gives a visual and audio cue to be able to sync to: the point at which the sound is made is the point at which the top and bottom parts of the slateboard hit. This is necessary for syncing all three cameras and the audio to the same timeline when video editing.


NOTE: Any time you stop recording on any input source (camera or audio) and start recording again, you must use the slateboard to provide another sync point.

, The actual filming of the play is actually the easiest part of the whole process. Since Cameras 1 and 2 will be in a fixed position, the only thing you need to worry about concerning them is making sure they stay on, recording, and in place the entire time. With camera 3, simply make sure you follow the center of the action.


To track your shots more easily, it helps to have a copy of the play's script. This way, you may know when and where people will be making entrances and exits.

Set up your scene.,
Find the right software.,
Get your ""tributes"".,
Assign each ""tribute"" an age, district, and backstory.,
Don't forget to put in the career alliance.,
If you are filming multiple Games, make sure you randomize the districts to make it seem like there are different chances every time.,
Make the ""weapons"".,
Make the Cornucopia.,
Film the tributes ""surviving"".",How to Film a Hunger Games Movie," You want to have a wild-ish look to your scene, so try to stay away from houses, streets, cars, etc. Try filming in the woods, like a hiking trail, a friend's place, or even your backyard, if you have a forest behind it. Make sure it is a large space, so you will not be using the same places over and over again. If you really want to make it great, find a creek or river to use as a ""water source"".;
, One of the most basic things you need is a camera and editing tools. For best results, use a camera made for outdoor filming. Then use some video editing programs like Windows or Final Cut. If you want to make it simple, just use an iTouch or iPad along with iMovie.

, You do not need 24, for it would be hard to get everyone in and it would be way too chaotic. An ideal number would be eight or nine, but you can work with less. Also, make sure all your tributes are okay with being filmed.

, This can be one of the most fun parts!

, Make sure that your careers are the strongest tributes. Careers are tributes from districts 1,2 and 4.

, If you want, you can base your games off of old victors (Enobaria, Cecilia, Gloss, Haymitch, etc.) to make it more exiting.

, Weapons are the most important part of the Games. Make sure to include a variety of weapons, such as swords, spears, a bow and arrow, tridents, slingshots, land mines, poison darts, or anything else that comes to mind. You can either buy them online, or you can make them yourself. Here are some ways to do this:


Make a Toy Bow and Arrow
Make a Toy Spear
Make a Blow Dart Gun
Get creative with your weapons!

, This is the most important step if you are starting from the beginning of your Games.


Find a flat, large space to use, and make sure there is nothing tributes will trip over.
Put all of your ""weapons"" in the Cornucopia, all spread out at different distances. Also, put two to seven backpacks in there, filled with food (Non-perishable. Don't add a banana and expect it not to spoil), water (full bottles, half filled, and empty), a small blanket, poison and poison antidote, first aid kit (nothing major), medicine, etc.
Put these backpacks at varying distances from the tributes, depending on how filled or not filled they are.
Place all your tributes in a circle around the Cornucopia, and make sure they don't move.

, This is the most fun part. You get to film a Hunger Games how you plan it. Show tributes raiding camps, fighting to the death, and just simply surviving. But remember, make it look as real as possible. Film as much as you want, and have fun.


Try not to smile or laugh when you are supposed to be lying on the ground dead, and use different places every time so you aren't using someones camping ground as a feast table.

Complete your script before getting started on the storyboards.,
Draw squares for each scene, leaving room for dialogue underneath.,
Establish the location, and any important objects, in your first box of the scene.,
Use arrows and notes to show any movement or changes.,
Fill in the scene's dialogue and sounds underneath the drawing.,
Make a new frame for each significant action or camera motion.,
Fill in essential notes about movement, sounds, or special effects.",How to Draw Storyboards1," If the script is a template for how a movie will sound, storyboard are the template for how they look. Storyboards are how you visualize how actors, props, backgrounds & camera angles will fit together in any particular scene or sequence of shots. It is your chance to visually map out the film before expensive cameras, actors, and crews are waiting around on set.


That said, one of the jobs of a storyboarder is to take the script and improve on it by adding visuals. You must know the full arc of the story before you get started.;
, Once you've written your script and have an idea of what will happen in your movie, get yourself some paper or poster board to assemble your storyboard on. Like a comic strip, each square represents a shot or scene and the space underneath is where you fill in the dialogue, notes, or action.


While you can draw your own boards, there are many free templates online that you can print out to start sketching immediately.

, The most important function of the storyboard is to show how the shot is going to look. For your first board, you'll want all the essential details so that people reading it know where they are. When wondering what to include, always ask the question: ""is this essential to understanding the scene?""


Anytime you change locations you need to draw in a new the background. Remember, you're telling the story visually. Try to imagine what you would need to see if this were a movie.
If the background doesn't change between shots, you can leave it blank and focus on the action.

, For example, if you want one character to punch another , you don't need to draw five frames of his fist moving slowly towards a face. Instead, draw one frame of the fist with an arrow indicating the movement.


You can also use arrows to indicate camera movements, such as pans or tilts.

, Remember, you're basically making a comic book version of the movie, so you should add essential sound effects as well. Don't worry if it doesn't all fit -- you're just giving markers to the director and crew about where the sound is matched up, so ellipses (""..."") can help.

, Whenever something happens, it needs it's own box. If you're drawing out a conversation, you'll want to switch from one character to another as they talk, as well as some shots of both of them at the same time. You need to draw each one of these shifts individually.


You cannot just draw 1-2 boxes and say ""alternate shots"" for a conversation. Imagine a scene where a mother is mad at her son for breaking a lamp. Showing the whole thing from the sad or scared son is a very different scene from showing the furious mom the whole time, cutting back and forth, or showing the broken lamp.

, If a scene requires a little fake blood, then make a note of it either using a red pen or jotting it down. If the shot requires a long, continuous take, use arrows to indicate how it all flows together. While there are proper terms for all of this, the most important thing is visually telling the story however you can. If it makes sense as a guide to filming, put it in.


If the camera isn't cutting, but lots of things are happening, you can use multiple boxes for one ""cut."" Whenever something happens, you need a new box, even if the camera doesn't move.

Start each day with an overview of the shots and scenes that need to be captured.,
Work with the actors to establish blocking first.,
Work with your Director of Photography to set up the camera angles.,
Light the shot when the cameras and actors are set.,
Place your microphones last, watching for any accidental shadows or exposed mics.,
Start each shot with a professional checklist to prepare the crew.,
After you have all the lines and essential action, pick up your ""coverage."",
Review your footage at the end of each day, noting any reshoots.",How to Film a Movie2," Run this by the entire crew and cast in the morning, laying down exactly which pages you'll be shooting. This should also be known in advance, but it is a good way to get everyone on the same page. If this is the very first day of shooting, review roles and responsibilities with each crew member. A communicative crew is an effective one, so set a good example first thing.


You should only expect to shoot, at most, 5-6 pages a day in a full production.
Some meetings are more crucial than others -- you'll likely want to talk to your Director of Photography every morning about mood, lighting, and shots, as well as talking to the main actors about their lines.
Have a backup plan -- if a shot goes too long, which other shots do you cut from the days schedule? If you have extra time, what scenes can you shoot in addition to the schedule?

, Blocking is where the actors go, how they move, and when they do it. While you should be mindful of lights, cameras, and sound, these can be adjusted to fit the scene once you know where the actors will be and where they deliver their lines. Still, keep the blocking as simple as possible. Cameras only capture a small sliver of the set, and convoluted choreography makes everyone else's jobs much, much harder.


If it helps, use tape to mark where the actors need to end up after each scene.
You don't need the main actors for all the blocking preparation. If you can use crew members to experiment with blocking in advance you can simply direct the actors to their spots when they arrive on set.

, If you're doing your own cinematography, the best advice is to consider each shot like a moving photograph. If you line it up like a compelling still image, you will have a compelling final shot. Don't attempt moving shots without equipment like steady-cams and a dolly unless you want an intentionally shaky shot (a la Blair Witch Project). For beginners, there are only three shots you need to master, and they will work for just about every scene:



Master: This is a big, wide angle shot that captures all, or nearly all, of the action in the scene without having to move.

Two-Shot: One camera goes over each actor's shoulder in a conversation, allowing you to jump from one perspective to the other. If there 3 or more people in the scene, try to fit at least two people in each shot. These two cameras should cover all of the dialogue.

Establishing Shots: These are usually the first shots in the scene, used to place the audience in the scene (like following a character through the door of a tavern). In some cases, your master can double as an establishing shot.

, While there are some people who like to set up both cameras and lights at the same time, you'll usually have to readjust the lights once you know your definitive camera angles. Lighting a movie set is an art form in itself, one that takes years to master, but beginning or independent filmmakers can generally play with two styles of lighting:



Realistic: You'll want a lot of diffusers, bouncing light off of walls and the ceiling. You're aiming for even lighting across the scene. A good way to check this is to put the shot temporarily in black and white. You should have nice, deep blacks and a wide range of grays, with only a little bright white for contrast. Try using ""practicals"" -- which are in-set lights like lamps or ceiling fans, to help.

Artistic or Dramatic: Use big lights, colored lights, and sharp contrasts to make striking, almost unrealistic compositions, like those in Sin City, or even ""Her."" While dramatic lighting is always fun to play with, make sure there is a purpose for it if you're straying from realism.

, Though good audio is arguably more important than good video for a professional shoot, it still needs to go last so it doesn't intrude on the set. Like all jobs on set, film audio is a difficult and nuanced job, but that doesn't mean beginners can't do a good job. Depending on your equipment, you'll have different jobs:



Boom Pole: This is a powerful mic on a long metal pole. Usually, it is held above the camera line with the mic pointing down at the actor's faces. It picks up incredible audio, but it needs to be moved to angle at whatever actor is speaking.

Lavaliere Mics: These are stuck on the actor discreetly, like those small mics seen in documentaries. There are many that can be taped to an actor's chest, under the shirt, as well.

Shotgun Mics: The cheapest and easiest mics to use, these are simply placed on the camera while shooting. They are almost always better than the camera's attached microphone.

, The following dialogue is used, in some form, on almost all movie sets. You can adapt it to suit your own needs and shoot, but you should always run through these checks, no matter how you say it.


""This is picture, quiet on set!""
""Roll sound!"" This is the cue to start microphones. The audio person yells, ""rolling!"" when ready.
""Roll Picture!"" This is the cue to start cameras. When each camera person (or the DP) is ready, they yell ""Speed!""
""This is Awesome Wiki Movie, Scene 1, Take 2."" Slap the clapboard or just clap when done.
Give 3-5 seconds of silence, which makes editing the film much, much easier.
""ACTION!"", These are the small shots that are easy to forget but make up much more of movies than you might think. For example, when a character checks their watch, you might cut to a close up of their wrist showing the time. You can also try some extreme or fun camera angles for specific lines or moments, or set up a few artistic shots for intros and outros of scenes.


Think about what shots are essential to tell your story -- for example, a shot of a test your protagonist just said they failed, a ticking clock, etc.

, In a perfect world you won't have to reshoot anything and at the end of the day you'll have usable, perfect footage for every scene. But in the crazy world of filmmaking, the day is rarely so simple. Whether or not to reshoot is often a judgment call depending on your time, budget, and actors. You have to weigh how much you need the shot against what it will cost to go shoot it again.


The sooner you watch the day's footage, the sooner you can correct mistakes if you need."
"
Avoid the use of patented logos, trademarks, and copyrights as possible.,
Write contracts, even if you're just filming with friends.,
Set aside time to pick up B-roll, the connective footage that fills in between scenes.,
Make and keep track of a budget.,
Secure an editor for your film.,
Have the film professionally mastered and color corrected.,
Treat your crew, the unspoken soldiers of the film, with love and respect.",How to Film a Movie3," If you have a Pepsi logo in the middle of your scenes, you will actually hurt your chances at getting into film festivals. Why? Because you would owe Pepsi money if the film was purchased, since they have the trademark. This includes music as well, meaning you can't use your favorite Red Hot Chili Peppers song unless you can pay for it.


In a pinch, tape and permanent markers are a great way to cover up logos on objects you can't move, like an oven or fridge.

, On a long movie, you could lose weeks of work if an essential cast member ups and leaves midway through. Contracts may feel impersonal, but they are quite the obvious -- a contract allows you to stay friends by always knowing where each other stand. There is too much to do on a movie set as it is -- don't add bickering or worrying about payment and schedules, too., B-roll is generally considered any shots that don't have any spoken lines and non-essential shots that help transition through scenes. Watch a few movies and notice the little, 1-2 clips, usually between scenes, and note how they visually move the story along. Think of it like the shots outside the car in a road trip movie, the sleek shots of James Bond's new car, and any other purely visual embellishment or scene.


Be creative with B-roll, this is you and the DP's chance to be artful with much less stress.
Make sure your b-roll fits the tone or tenor of the movie. Punch Drunk Love uses bright, abstract colors to indicate mood swings. Horror movies use slow, dark shots. Action movies use stark, extreme, and dramatic landscapes, etc., Movies get expensive, quickly, but the worst thing that can happen is a to run out of essential funds with only 10 pages left to shoot. You need to budget everything out considerably once you've finished pre-production, including:


Cast and crew wages and food
Rights to music our sounds
Transportation
Props and Costumes
Filming equipment, There are a lot of people who don't believe and director should edit their own work. Why? Because editing is about ruthlessly cutting the movie down to only the very best parts, and most directors are too attached to the material to cut it objectively. You will, of course, give guidance, and watch rough cuts and provide notes, but you should look online for another editor to help wade through the 100's of hours of footage you have.


Be ready to watch the movie hundreds of times. It can help to bring in a trusted friend or two as well to notice things you and your editor might miss.
Depending on your editor's skill set, you may need a sound designer as well to create sound effects and find and place music.

, This usually costs around a $1,000-$5,000 for a full-length movie. Mastering will take the audio volumes and balance them into a cohesive track, making sure everything is easy to here and there are no jarring transitions. Color correction simply ensures that every shot looks the same, fixing small issues and creating an eye-popping final image.


Color-correction is not simply a technical aspect-- it can be used to create the whole visual mood and motif of the scene by making it brighter or darker, more vibrant or more somber.

, Throw them a wrap party. Buy them coffee and donuts every now and then. Many of these people will never be well known, and they will be putting in just as many backbreaking and tiring hours as you are. It is easy to remember to pamper your actors, but the crew is just as important and just as worth your attention.


Always be one of the first people on set. There will always be something for you to do, and it sets a good example.

Use the angle of a camera to indicate character relationships and feelings.,
Try writing the scene out as prose if you're struggling to get started.,
Study cinematography.",How to Draw Storyboards2," Don't let the script ""speak for itself;"" The best movies are thematically related on all levels: writing, storyboarding, sound effects, acting, etc. It is your job to take a good script and turn it into great visuals. Each scene, ask yourself what the goal of the scene is, what's the mood or tone, and what the most important props, characters, or moments are. How can you draw attention to these things?


Find the most crucial element of the scene, and find a way to draw the audience's attention to it in each shot, making it bigger, centering it, zooming into it, etc.
Gene Wilder wasn't a storyboarder, but he thought like a visual comedian. In Willy Wonka, the famous intro where he ""accidentally"" trips, falls, and rolls to raucous applause was drawn up by him as a way to portray Wonka as fun, strange, and hiding behind a comic facade., What you don't want is a completely flat floor, where the camera is at a right angle to the ground. Tilting the shot slightly gives your storyboard three dimensions, even if it's only a slight shift. Straight on shots are almost never as exciting as dynamic, 3D compositions.


Use the foreground and background to your advantage as well -- don't put every character or thing on the same depth line.
Don't forget about the far, far background either -- it is a good place to create depth.
Of course, there are plenty of reasons to break this rule, such as creating a perfectly symmetrical shot. Just know why you're breaking the rule before you do it., Usually this is obvious -- if another character is speaking, you need to cut to show them. If someone hears a noise behind them, you cut to the location the noise came from. All good cuts must have have a reason to occur-- whether it is the plot, characters, shifting attention, or a purely artistic choice.


One of the most famous cuts ever is in 2001: A Space Odyssey, where director Stanley Kubrick cuts from a flying weapon to a satellite in space. In one cut, he bridges the gap between primitive man and future man while implying that little has changed but the setting.

, The angle of your shot tells the audience how to feel about the characters or scenes. You can use this fact in endless ways and should always ask yourself how your camera angle helps or hinders the point of the shot. For example:


Looking down on a character makes them seem weak, fearful, or powerless. Looking up makes someone seem powerful, confident, and dominant.
Extreme angles like very high, vert low, or titled shots show confusion, fear, or and off-the-wall experience like a drug trip.

, Sitting down and starting the scene, making difficult choices like camera angle and composition, is hard if you're not sure what direction you want to take things yet. A good intermediate step is to write out the scene like a short story. What parts pop out as important, what details stick out as you're writing, and what are the key actions in each shot? You can then edit this mini-script as a practice run before drawing.Stick to just 1-2 descriptions for each shot or scene. You're not writing a novel, you're writing a guide.

, Storyboards are, in essence, practice shots of a movie. As such, they goal is to use the boards to set up actual lights, cameras, and sets to mimic the shot your drew up. Diving deeply into shot types, color composition, camera angles, and more will greatly increase your toolkit as a storyboarder.


Drawing a storyboard is cheap, but shooting is not. If working on a larger film, you need to know the rough difficulty of shots to know if they're feasible. Way high-up shots may look amazing and fit the film, but helicopter filming is very expensive!

Learn the terminology of common camera angles.,
Familiarize yourself with camera motions to illustrate moving or changing shots.,
Make appropriate notes of transitions between shots.,
Remember basic blocking instructions to help set the scene and actors.,
Label your shots correctly so the rest of the crew can read them.,
Aim for clarity, not perfect symbols or vocab, if you are confused.",How to Draw Storyboards3," Don't simply rely on drawing to get your point across -- the film world is full of vocabulary that makes your job easier and your storyboards more precise. Writing down camera angles helps camera crews quickly see what shots they must prepare for, and lets you see if you're getting accidentally repetitive with your shot choice.



Establishing Shots: Quick shots that illustrate the set, location, or start position of the characters.

Full, Medium, Close, Extreme Close: If you're showing a character, how much are you showing? Full (FS) shows the whole body, Medium (MS) shows waist up, Close (CU) shows shoulders and head, and Extreme Close Up (ECU) shoes only face.

Up Shot / Down Shot: Up Shots look up at a character, while Down Shots look down from above. ""Worm's Eye"" and ""Bird's Eye"" are the extreme versions of each.

Over the Shoulder (OTS): One of your most important terms, these shots have one person or thing on the side of the frame, back turned, while looking at another. Very common in conversations between two people.

Two-shot: When both characters, usually speaking to each other, are both in the frame at once. When drawing dialogue, two-shots often alternate with OTS shots.

POV Shots Are simply when the camera mimics the point of view of a character., The following list is by no means exhaustive, but it is a good primer on writing coherent storyboards. Whenever you want to add one, write the actual camera motion on the storyboard.



""Tracking' is when the camera follows the action without cutting, like following someone as they walk down the street. Use arrows to indicate motion, and multiple frames if needed.

Pans are when the camera simply rotates in one direction, often following a character as they move or exposing something near them. Draw an arrow illustrating the camera's direction.

Trucks are when the camera physically moves in or out. Imagine a shot of a TV, then the camera slowly ""trucking"" back to reveal a family watching the TV in the living room. Use 4 lines, pointing from the center of the screen out to the corners, to show trucking.

Rack Focus is when you have a blurry object in the background and a clear one in the foreground, then the focus shifts from one to the other (it can go in reverse, too). Draw a line indicating where the focus starts and where it moves to., The following cuts are some of the most common in film, and must be noted in your storyboard. Each one requires a small drawing alongside the words, visually representing the transition. Start with a small rectangle, representing the screen, right before the dialogue, then fill this rectangle in with your transition:



Fade In/Fade Out: This is simply when the image appears or disappears slowly from a blank screen. For a fade in, draw a triangle pointing left. For a fade out, draw a triangle pointing right.

Cross Dissolve: When one image is slowly faded into the next one. To draw it, make two intersecting triangles in the box, starting from all four corners. It is the fade out and fade in drawings superimposed on one another.

Wipe: When one image physically moves across the screen, revealing the next shot underneath it. Simply draw a vertical line in the center of the rectangle, and an arrow running through it to indicate which way the first image is moving., The following terms refer to an object's place in the shot. It can also help directing motion, such as if a character walks from the back of the shot to the front, which could be expressed as ""BG → FG.""



Foreground (FG): The area close up to the camera.

Midground (MG): The center of the frame

Background (BG): The are furthest from the camera.

Off-screen (O/S): Helpful if there is a noise, dialogue, etc. that the viewers can't see, or if a character enters or exits the frame completely.

Overlay (OL): When one object or image is superimposed on another but both are visible.

, In general, a ""scene"" on a storyboard actually refers to an unbroken camera movement, not a full event. These scenes are added together to form a ""sequence,"" which is the whole action, conversation, that you're portraying (what you normally call a ""scene"").


Whenever the camera cuts, you must change the scene number to indicate a new shot.
If a single scene requires multiple actions, all without changing the camera, they are labeled as panels. If one shot requires three storyboards, you would label each panel as 1/3, 2/3, and 3/3., The ultimate goal of a storyboard is to visually tell the movie, not to pass a vocabulary test. While you should always strive to learn the terminology, you want the storyboards to be easily read by directors, cinematographers, and the rest of the crew. If you have an idea but don't know how to express it, use your drawing skills to convey the point as simply as possible. Arrows, notes, and multiple panels should all be used to share your creative ideas when words don't suffice.


Imagine a long, singular shot, like the beginning of Raging Bull. While there is no cut, you could never contain that shot in just one panel. You'd need to string many panels together with arrows, notes, and dialogue to plan the shot out.
The vocab lists above are far from complete -- there are hundreds of words, shots, and cues a pro storyboarder uses. To be a professional, you should keep researching professional terms.

Combine a repeating, rhythmic bass pattern in the left hand with chords and licks in the right hand.",How to Play Boogie Woogie Piano," Music is a language, and like learning any language, you need to listen to its native speakers. Start by listening to some of the old masters to get an idea of their rhythms, phrasing, timing, and styles. Here are some good people to start with: Clarence ""Pinetop"" Smith, Cripple Clarence Lofton, Jabo Williams, Montana Taylor, Jimmy Yancey, Hersal Thomas, Albert Ammons, Meade Lux Lewis, Pete Johnson, Big Maceo Merriweather, Otis Spann, Amos Milburn, Professor Longhair and James Booker. Download their music and listen a little bit to them every day to start getting the true sounds of boogie-woogie in your ears!
, The left hand is the most important feature of boogie-woogie piano playing and without a steady bass pattern there is no hope of playing true boogie-woogie. Most left hand patterns are “8-to-the-bar”, meaning there are eight eighth-notes played in every bar. Learn at least one left hand bass pattern and be able to play it automatically and independently of the right hand.

, This is a great exercise for getting your foot in the door to achieving left hand independence with any new bass pattern you learn.


For this example, use your boogie-woogie left hand pattern from Step two. Play the Shuffle pattern (staying on the C chord) in the left hand, and introduce increasingly complicated rhythms in the right hand, using a C6 chord in the first inversion.

, The most common musical form for boogie-woogie songs is a 12-bar bluesIt consists of three chord changes, the I chord, the IV chord, and the V chord. In the key of C, the I chord is C, the IV chord is F, and the V chord is G. It is absolutely essential that you memorize the 12-bar blues form.

You can simply transpose the voicing used for C6 to the keys of F and G, or you can try these different voicings: to make an F chord, simply lower the E to an Eb from your C6 chord. This will make an F9 chord. For a G chord, shift your fingers slightly over to f-g-b-d. Practice the hand independence exercise shown above in the new keys of F (starting the left hand pinky finger on F, and playing an F chord in the right hand) and G (starting the left hand pinky finger on G, and playing a G chord in the right hand).

, In boogie-woogie piano playing, when the right hand is not playing chords to accompany vocals or another soloist, it usually plays licks. According to Arthur Migliazza’s book “How To Play Boogie Woogie Piano,"" there are only 8 primary licks, from which infinite variations and combinations are possible. Lick #1 is the most basic, and consists of keeping the right hand in the basic position of a C major triad.

, Learn some variations of the lick so that you have more material to work with in your song., The next step is to introduce your right hand licks to your left hand boogie-woogie bass pattern. Practice in C, F and G separately. ,, Introductions to boogie-woogie songs vary widely. A very common way to start a boogie-woogie is by simply playing the left hand bass pattern for four measure by itself, and then introduce the right hand.Another common way to begin a boogie-woogie is by using the first two chords of a turnaround progression, the I7 and I dim 7. In the key of C this means C7 and C diminished 7.


An intro of this sort is usually four measures in duration and consists of going back and forth between these two chords. These four measures count as the first four measures of the 12-bar form and when the left hand comes in with the bass pattern it is on the IV chord.

, The simplest way to end a boogie-woogie is by playing this figure with the left hand by itself.

, Use an intro to start and an ending to finish and now you’re playing boogie woogie!"

Mix and match your major and minor pentatonic scales, all in the same key, for the subtle country sound.,
Use both scales simultaneously for the country/western sound.,
Use your ""minor thirds"" to transition from one scale to the other.,
Use mixed notes, like the minor third, to transition between scales.",How to Play Country Lead Guitar1," The pentatonic scales, which remove the 2nd and 5th notes from normal major and minor scales, is tailor-made for the speed and rocking sound found in most forms of popular music. Review these two scales to the point where you can play them up and down, individually, with ease. You'll get to blending later.










A-Major Pentatonic:

, If you're in the key of A, you want both the A-major pentatonic and the A-minor pentatonic, as the combination leads to country's unique, blues-inspired sound. While the rest of the article concerns how to transition quickly, you should practice on your own with your favorite country song -- how can you use them to get the sound you want?








, This is easiest to see on the 1st string, 8th fret-- the last note of the A-minor pentatonic scale. The next fret after, the 9th, is the exact same note as the 4th note of the major scale -- providing a great transition point. Bending or sliding into it from either direction is a good way to shift into the other scale. You can also play the identical fret on the low-E (6th) string as well to help transition.









There is another minor third on the 3rd string, 5th fret.
These bends like to ""resolve"" on the root note, meaning they finish on the nearest A (for example, the 1st string, 5th fret).

, Use the example in the video above to see this in action. Any notes where the scales overlap, or can be bent or slid into a note in the opposite scale, are fair game. It is these transition-like notes, when used sparingly, that give the country sound.

You must always have an INTEREST in the topic you are learning.,


,
Do not be confused into thinking the bands like ""Suicide Silence"" are a part of the death metal genre.,

Now all you have to do is make the music!",How to Play Reckless Death Metal," There would be no point in reading this article if you think that this kind of music is ""too loud,"" ""makes you scared to sleep at night,"" or ""gives you a headache."" Some good band to listen to in order to help you get influence from would be Porkfarm, Internal Suffering, Nile, Origin or Brain Drill. These are some of the most brutal death metal bands out there. Please also check out Disgorge(US) and Dying Fetus, they are also the legends of utilising complex riffs and PH in their riffs. Also, do not confuse Grindcore music with Brutal Death Metal, they are totally different thing too.;
,, They are part of a genre known as ""deathcore"" which, while similar to death metal, it is not the same thing. You must be able to appreciate the music.

, This article is going to focus on guitar specifically. Now, let's get started. You are going to need a guitar meant for death metal in order to play that genre correctly. You do not need an expensive guitar. a decent guitar with good pickups and a decent amp will give you a good enough sound.


Brands you should look for would include Ibanez, Jackson, B.C.Rich, Schecter, ESP, or Dean. If you really want to spice up your tone you can get one of these guitar with EMG pickups.

, In order to play in these low tunings comfortably, you need to have your strings set to a heavy gauge. This basically means that the higher the gauge, the heavier the strings. A good gauge to start on would be 10 gauge. As you get more experienced, you can and must go to higher gauges. The average gauge for the experienced player is usually 12 gauge. REMEMBER, every time you switch to a higher gauge, you MUST have your truss rod adjusted. This is a metal rod in the neck of the guitar that keeps it straight. If your neck is bent improperly, then your guitar will keep going out of tune and prevent you from playing properly. The higher the gauge gets, the more pressure is put upon your guitar neck. You can get this adjusted usually, at any guitar shop, just ask.

, The best brand would be line 6. A good starter amp would be a 15 watt spider 3 line 6 amp. It gives you good distortion for those punch in the face Chuggs and also gives you a good amount of cool effects.

, Watch their techniques and learn their songs. Do not struggle to sound perfect. You Will get better as time passes if you put effort into it. Most people say "" you HAVE TO learn these scales, you MUST know these chords, you HAVE TO learn this before you learn that, blah blah blah..."" well, others say, SELF TAUGHT IS BEST. Just learn as many songs as you can and learn how to play them accurately and you WILL get better and learn many skills. But here are some essential skills:


natural/pinched harmonics
palm muting
tremolo picking
sweep picking
tapping
alternate picking

Some of these techniques WILL take a while to learn and are quite a challenge.



, Think about everything you hate (the kids who bully you in school, chores that your parents make you do, friends who back stab you, the people who play cruel, mean, awful pranks on you and say the meanest things to you for no reason ) and incorporate it into your riffs. When you come up with enough riffs and get into the habit of it and actually ENJOY the wonderfully art of making music JOIN A BAND! get all of your friends and tell them your plans. its guaranteed that someone will want to play drums, someone will want to do bass, someone will want to play guitar alongside with you, and someone will want to do vocals. if not then look for people. search the internet, or set up fliers around your neighborhood. once you and the guys (or girls) get a couple of songs together start to play somewhere. Play in the subway or at block parties. If you're old enough, play at bars and little public get together places like that."

Experiment with blues scales over the major chords in the background.",How to Play Country Lead Guitar2," Even if you're unsure of music theory, this is less complex than it seems. All you do is take the second note in your pentatonic scale and bend it up a full-step. If you can match it with another note, holding the other string in place as you bend the 2nd note.

, For somewhat complex musical theory quirks, you can play a minor blues scale three frets away from your root note and still sound in key. For example, in the key of A-major, which starts on the 5th fret, you can also play the F# Minor Blues Scale, which starts on the 2nd fret.

E|-2-5---------------------------------|, The flat fifth of the minor pentatonic blues scale (the note right between the 3rd and 4th notes of the scale) is your minor third, and can be used to get right back into the major pentatonic.








In fact, the furthest note to the right of your pentatonic scale, on every string, is the first note of the associated major scale.

, Now that you know how to navigate the scales, hitting your flat 5ths, bending your 2nd notes into 3rds, and sliding around minor thirds, you can stick to a simple blues scale. As the chords change, change with them -- moving to A-minor pentatonic over A-major chords, then to an E-minor pentatonic for an E-major chord, etc. There is no ""right"" way to play country guitar -- so just keep practicing.









A big slide on the thick strings, like sliding into the first note of the scale, makes for some serious country starts to a lick or solo.
Get used to some finger picking-- try to pluck a couple strings with you pinky and ring fingers while still using your pick for the deeper notes."

For every location you add you have to break down your last set and move your crew, equipment and actors to the new location. For every location you use you have to pay for the right to film there (unless you can get it for free). It's easier to create a low-budget film by making a list of what you already have or can get and basing your story around that.;

, Storyboards can be made with blender 3-D and a Make human plug-in. If you plan to have 3-D production titles or CG in your film blender storyboarding is a good way to go. It's a full-service free 3-D software. Storyboards can be drawn, if you're not good at drawing, sketch it out to the best year ability even if that means stick figures and if need to let someone who is better at drawing redraw it in more detail.

, This is where you do not want to spend too little money. If you go to cheap your film will look cheap that might be what you're going for.


Camera. A good camera for filming low-budget movies is the Canon EOS Rebel T3i $850 or Rebel T2i $750 (there is a difference between T(2/3)i and T(2/3) T(2/3)i is much better).
Camera lens. You will need camera lenses of this size 28 mm lens (wide-angle), 50 mm lens (standard) and 70 mm lens (telephoto) with the lowest f/ number you can afford (nice ones can be found for around $700 a piece). If you use the lens that comes with the camera it will shoot decent video, but you will have to buy a telephoto lens if you need it for a shot.
Sound. You need an audio adapter like JuicedLink CX211 2 XLR ($200), JuicedLink CX231 2 XLR($300) or BeachTek DXA-SLR Dual XLR($400). Whatever adapter you choose make sure it has phantom power with 48 V. You need a shotgun mic and a boom pole a kit with everything you need can be found at b&h video ($550-$1,000).
Lighting. A decent independent film lighting kit can be bought for $500 or less by googling video lighting kit. If your only an extremely low budget tungsten-based film lights can be bought for $20 apiece are less. If you can afford softbox lighting you can bounce light off of the white surface like a poster board to get a softer lighting feel.
Computer. Almost all computers now can handle HD video editing as long as your computer is reasonably fast you should be fine. If you don't have a reasonably fast computer you can buy a very nice computer for last than a $1,000.
Editing. An the upper end of editing software is Adobe premium Pro and Apple Final Cut, but there are many lower-cost software like that would probably do everything you needed to. A list of editing software, many of them free ($0-$700).

, Community theaters are in almost every town and have experienced actors ready to add to their experience. Many mid-size cities have acting schools with actors ready to do a film to help build their credits. Beginning actors are likely to work for free or very little if they take you seriously, so do all your pre-planning so they have something to take you seriously for. If you do intend to pay your actors, take into consideration that for Paranormal Activity, the actors were paid $500 each.

, No matter where you start your chord, the from will always be the same. If you started on the 3rd fret, for a G7 chord, your ring finger goes on the 5th string, 5th fret. So, when building a G7:









--?--
--?--
--?--
--?--
--5--
--3--

, You don't need to place a finger down on this fret -- the barred note takes care of it. This note is the titular seventh note for that chord, which is the note making your chord a dominant seventh. Again, if you wanted the G7 barre chord:









--?--
--?--
--?--
--3--
--5--
--3--

, Again, you'll notice that your ring and middle finger are in the same position as an open E7 chord -- this is because the barre acts as the equivalent of a bunch of open strings, since open and barred strings are both when all six strings are ""fretted"" at the same place and time.









--?--
--?--
--4--
--3--
--5--
--3--

, These notes need to stay barred, though they are usually the hardest two notes to get used to holding. Before playing the whole chord, pick them individually to see if they are barred hard enough to sound out cleanly. Adjust as necessary.

, Your fingers will always be in this shape, no matter what root note you pick. Move to the 7th fret and you have a B7. Move to the 11th and you have a D#7. The malleability of barre chords makes it easy to quickly craft songs and shift chords with ease. An E-form C7, for example, would look like this:

Find a venue for your gig.,
Make sure you book your venue at least a month in advance of the gig, but the more advance it is would be better, so you can promote it better and get everything done before the gig.

,
Get the cost of renting the venue for the night and add it to your budget.,
Decide whether it is to be a seated or standing evening.,
Decide whether the gig will have assigned seats or general admission.,
Organize security.,
Set an age limit.,
Get insurance.",How to Organise a Gig2," Local theatres, cinemas, schools and function rooms are open to be rented.

However, once you find it talk to the manager to make sure it's within their rules to hold a live event. Your best bet is to use a theatre, as many theatres have the option of holding a seated or standing gig and already have a PA system and stage installed; this cuts costs.
There are also an increasing number of pubs dedicated to live music, these are generally around 100-300 capacity and should also have sound engineers on their books and an in house PA. This last point is vital, if this is your first time putting on a gig, having an in house PA not only cuts costs but means that A)this is a venue where people come often enough to warrant an in house PA B)the system should be set up to work with the room making your sound engineers job easier and C) this will greatly reduce the amount of time and hassle before/after the gig as there is one less thing for you to sort out and there will only be a minimal amount of gear going in/ coming out of the venue.







,, (sometimes venues want a cut of the ticket sales instead, don't let them have more than 40% as that's already far too much if you have extra costs), When it's a standing gig, you can usually have a larger capacity and the public often prefer standing gigs as you can dance and mosh if it's a metal gig.

, People usually prefer general admission because everyone has a shot at front row for the same price. However, a seated, assigned seat gig requires less security and less hassle for you.

, Theatres and venues often have door staff employed, but you may need to pay extra for their services. If this is a very localized gig with few people you may be able to get some of your larger, more confident friends to do security at it. However, laws often require that you get professional security staff. Add this cost to your budget

, If the venue has a bar, decide whether it will be distributing alcohol or not. If it is, it must be an over-age event. Alcohol being sold may increase your Insurance costs.

, Public Liability Insurance (PLI) may be included with the venue but always check. 200 bucks for insurance for the night is better than a million dollars lawsuit. All insurance companies have an option for PLI, but shop around for the best price. Also, with each gig you organize, as long as there are no accidents, the cost of your insurance will go down because you have proved you're responsible and there is less risk. Add the cost of insurance to your budget.

Determine which bands will be playing at the event; you will need between three and six acts.

,
Pick one band that has a large fan base and often headlines gigs about this size.,
Pick your other bands.,
Calculate the costs of getting bands.,
Get a Sound Engineer.,
Get an MC.",How to Organise a Gig3,", They will be your headliners and will ensure that you get a large enough crowd. Hopefully, they will supply you with the drums for the night and some amps. If they won't, get one of the other bands to do this. It's more effective, and it's cheaper than renting instruments.

, It's recommended that you get at least one band that is totally unheard of; they can open the night and it will promote them, as well as earn you one new contact., Some bands may have a fee, but often, unsigned/local bands will play for nothing if you throw in a few free tickets for their friends. However, don't take advantage of their generosity and always set aside some cold hard cash from the budget to give each band. Even if its only 40 or 50 quid a band, they'll appreciate it. Throw in a few quid extra for whichever band supplied the drums etc. just for wear and tear, and as a thanks. Add this cost to your budget figure.

, If the venue has one, and has a PA installed, use him. If not, a Sound Engineer may supply a PA and set up the system for a cost. If you are familiar with using a PA and miking amps etc, feel free to organise this yourself, but it is an added hassle. Maybe one of your friends/new-contacts can do this for free. Add any costs incurred to your budget.

, This is the guy that introduces the bands, and closes the night. Try to get someone locally famous on the band scene, or do it yourself. It just takes some confidence, and a few minutes of preparation. Caution, a rubbish/drunk/unpopular MC can ruin a night and cause unnecessary hassle, better no MC than one that causes you problems

Put the most popular band on last, and the least popular first.

,
Give each starting band equal stage time; the final two bands should get a little extra time.

,
Tell the bands they prepare their set for extra 5 minutes longer or 5 minutes shorter than they actually have.,
Organising gear requirements, gear sharing and sound check times is tricky.,
Allow bands to sell CDs and merchandise if possible during breaks and after the show.,
Stay within the venue's time restraints.

,
Generally leave 15 minutes between each band for setting up.,
Play music during the breaks.",How to Organise a Gig4,",, For example, if they have a 30-minute set tell them to prepare a 25-minute set and also a 30-minute or longer set, to keep everything running smoothly even if that goes out of control. However, be gentle and do not cut their performance while it is live (such as cutting amplifier's power, turning off volume, etc). Secretly get your messages to the band behind the stage. Chances are, that one edgy band keeps on playing and you should stay calm, get a few security officers with you and finish their set after they finished the current song.

, constant communication is required, there is no point in 5 bands bringing 5 drum kits, and 5 sets of amps, only for four of them sit outside in vans ready to be stolen. generally it is the headlining acts job to supply a drum kit, and the other drummers will have to provide what are known as breakables, (snare, cymbals, bass drum pedal) However, some drummers are not comfortable with this and will want other bands to use another kit. If each band does use their own kit, the gap between bands will go from 15 minutes to 25 and sound checks will be at least 5 minutes longer. On a night with three bands, not a problem, 5 bands and an 11 O'clock cut off, you will have major night mares. Likewise with guitarists, it is generally acceptable to use other people cabs (the speakers under their amps) but not the amps themselves unless the bands know each other and/or are particularly laid back. This gets tricky when headlining acts have combo amps or not enough cabs to go around. Then you have the added complication of a bands that isn't just drums/bass/gtr/vocals. Keyboards, Acoustic Guitars, mandolins, banjo's, kazoos, brass sections, harps etc can bring on premature aging in a sound engineer if they are presented on the night with no prior warning. Start with the headlining act, What will they bring, what will they need, what will they share. Tell the next band down what is available to them, then ask them the same three questions. By the time you get to the bottom couple of bands, you should have all your shortages sorted. There may be drum kits coming from one band, cabs from others that only certain bands can use etc, but as long as you have it all written down, it should be fairly easy to keep track of. From this, you should be able to, with the help of your sound engineer, work out how long they need for sound checking, if they all need a sound check and then organise times and let the bands know. Sounds like a lot of work, and it is, but it will save you from some big time stress on the night.

, Don't charge them for doing this.

,, It is however a good idea to check this with the sound engineer as some bands may take more time to set up/pack down depending on gear changes etc.

, Music styles similar to the band on the nights, but none of their music. Sound Engineers will do this for you, just tell them before hand so they bring the connection for your MP3 player.

Barre an open A7 chord to play any seventh chord starting on the 5th string.,
Barre the lower five strings with your index finger.,
On the 4th string, play the note two frets down from your barre.,
On the 2nd string, play the note two frets down from your barre as well.,
Leaving the final string open, play the lower five strings.",How to Play Dominant Seventh Chords on Guitar2," Just as any barre chord on the 6th string is an E-form chord, anything starting on the 5th string is an ""A-from barre chord."" Again, the shapes all match open A chords, so if you simply barre two frets up from a basic open A7 you can get your barre chord shape anywhere. If you forget the A7, its a simple chord to remember:









--0--
--2--
--0--
--2--
--0--
--X--

, Wherever this barre starts is the root note. So, this note determines what chord you have -- start on a D, and you have a D7. Start the barre on the 5th string, 5th fret, for example, and you'll have a A-from D7 chord:









--5--
--5--
--5--
--5--
--5--
--X--

, This is identical to the start of an E-form chord. If you're barring for a D7 (5th fret), then you'll play the 7th fret on the 4th string.









--?--
--?--
--?--
--7--
--5--
--X--

, Skipping the 3rd string (it stays barred), use your pinky to play the note two frets from the barre on the B-string. The lowest string stays barred as well, meaning you've finished the chord. Again, remember that this shape is identical to an open A7, plus the barre. Your final D7 looks like this:









--5--
--7--
--5--
--7--
--5--
--X--

, Do not strum the top string of the note -- it is an extraneous, low E that will muddy up your sound. However, you now have the A-form dominant seventh chord shape down, and could move it anywhere on the fifth string to play the chord. Start on the 7th string for an E7, for example:









--7--
--9--
--7--
--9--

, A G7 is nearly identical to a G major chord, and if anything is actually easier to play, since you don't need to use your pinky. Set up a normal G chord using your ring and middle finger for the top two notes. Then, instead of your pinky on the 1st string, 3rd fret, place it on the 1st string, 1st fret for a G7.

, Another simple chord, this is actually just a normal C major chord with one note added by your pinky. Set up your open C-major chord like normal, then simply add your pinky on the 3rd string, 3rd fret. You'll have a little triangle shape with the fingers on the 3rd, 4th, and 5th strings:









--0--
--1--
--3--
--2--
--3--
--X--

, The D7 looks just like an inverted D-major chord. You only play the bottom four strings, and the 1st and 3rd strings are identical. But to play the D7, you play the 1st fret on the 2nd string, not the 3rd. As such, you need to switch all your fingers, using the ring finger on the lowest string, then the index, then the middle:

Write a Press Release, and send it to newspapers in your area, and the area of the gig, a few weeks before the gig. Try to get the newspaper to send a photographer if they have an 'Out& About' section or similar.

, Try to set up your own account dedicated to your organising gigs if you are really serious.

Add together all your costs so far to get your budget.

,
Divide this by the number of tickets you have available for sale, not including ones you plan to give away for free.,
Get the venue to print your tickets, unless you're experienced in running gigs; it is probably included in their fee anyway.,
Try to avoid assigning seats unless the venue absolutely insists, first come, first served is much more appealing to a young crowd, and it will make sure everyone gets there on time for the first act.

",How to Organise a Gig6,", This is the minimum amount you can charge per ticket to break even. You may like to run your first gig as non profit, to get people in your area interested in local gigs.


If you want to make a profit, add on about 20% to this figure, but always have a round ticket price. It must be divisible by either 2 or 5. For example 11 is not OK but 12 or 10 is fine.

, If they don't print tickets, sell tickets on the door; there will be no paper and/or forged tickets involved this way. Use a hand stamp on people as they arrive. Get an original stamp, but remember, unless it's hand made someone else could have one. So get an original colour ink pad to use, and change the colour and stamp for every gig you run.

Determine your audience.,

Make the message clear.",How to Make a CD Mix1," Make the mix CD with someone specific in mind, whether this is yourself, someone you like romantically, or just a friend you want to share some music with. Having a clear idea of who the CD is meant for will help you choose the songs. You want the person who listens to this CD to enjoy it, so consider what they already like and include some of that. Additionally, you can take a chance and add songs that you think they will like based on what you know they like., The best mix CDs will have some kind of overall theme that ties the songs together, rather than being a completely random and disconnected set of songs. Common themes might be songs about love or songs for a road trip, but a theme could be starting a new school year, becoming friends, or inspiring music for a workout. Having a theme in mind helps establish the mood you hope the CD achieves and gives you something to aim for in compiling the songs.You might have the theme of “songs for the weekend” in mind, but don’t just add a bunch of songs that have “weekend” in the title. A theme is about continuity of the songs' tone and content, not just titles that have words in common.

, If you are making the CD for a particular person or occasion, it should have a message that the songs all work together to send. The theme gives a general guideline of how the songs should fit together while the message is what you want the mix to actually say. The audience also plays a large part in crafting the message, because you probably don’t want a mix for your boyfriend to send the same message as a mix for your grandma."

“Pitch” refers to the sensation of lowness or highness associated with the frequency of a given sound. The greater the frequency, the higher the pitch. The frequency difference between any two pitches is called an “interval.”
“Note” refers to a named range of pitches. The standard frequency for A above middle C is 440 hertz, but some orchestras use a slightly different standard, such as 443 hertz, to produce a brighter sound.Most people can determine whether a note sounds right when played against another note or in part of a series of notes in a piece of music they recognize. This is called “relative pitch.” A few people possess “absolute pitch” or “perfect pitch,” which is the ability to identify a given pitch without hearing a reference pitch.;
,


“Timbre” refers to the combination of primary pitch (fundamental) and secondary pitches (overtones) that sound whenever a musical instrument plays a note. When you pluck the low E string on an acoustic guitar, you actually hear not only the low E note, but also additional pitches at frequencies that are multiples of the low E frequency. The combination of these sounds, which are also collectively called “harmonics,” are what makes one instrument sound different from another kind of instrument.“Tone” is a somewhat more nebulous term. It refers to the effect the combination of fundamental and secondary harmonics have on the listener’s ear. Adding more high-pitched harmonics to the timbre of a note produces a brighter or sharper tone, while damping them produces a more mellow tone.“Tone” also refers to an interval between two pitches, also called a whole step. Half this interval is called a “semitone” or half-step., Music notes can be named in several ways. Two methods are commonly used in most of the Western world.


Letter names: Notes of certain frequencies are assigned letter names. In English and Dutch-speaking countries, the letters run from A to G. In German-speaking countries, however, “B” is used for the B-flat note (the black piano key between the A and B keys), and an “H” is used to represent the B-natural note (the white B key on a piano).Solfeggio (also called “solfege” or “solfeo”): This system, familiar to fans of ‘’The Sound of Music,’’ assigns one-syllable names to notes according to their successive positions within a scale. The original system developed by 11th century monk Guido d’Arezzo used “ut, re, mi, fa, sol, la, si,” taken from the first words of lines in a chant to St. John the Baptist.Over time, “ut” was replaced with “do,” while some shorten “sol” to “so” and sing “ti” instead of “si.” (Some parts of the world use the solfeggio names the way the Western world uses letter names.) , A scale is a series of successive intervals between pitches such that the highest pitch is at twice the frequency of the lowest pitch. This range is called an octave. These are some of the common scales:


A full chromatic scale uses 12 half-step intervals. Playing an octave on the piano from middle C to the C above middle C, sounding all the white and black keys in between, produces a chromatic scale. Other scales are more restricted forms of this scale.
A major scale uses seven intervals: The first and second are whole steps; the third is a half-step; the fourth, fifth, and sixth are whole steps; and the seventh is a half-step. Playing an octave on the piano from middle C to the C above, sounding only the white keys, is an example of a major scale.
A minor scale also uses seven intervals. The most common form is the natural minor scale. Its first interval is a whole step, but the second is a half-step, the third and fourth are whole steps, the fifth is a half-step, and the sixth and seventh are whole steps. Playing an octave on the piano from A below middle C to A above middle C, sounding only the white keys, is an example of a natural minor scale.
A pentatonic scale uses five intervals. The first interval is a whole step, the next is three half-steps, the third and fourth are each a whole step, and the fifth is three half-steps. (In the key of C, this means the notes used are C, D, F, G, A, and C again.)You can also play a pentatonic scale by playing only the black keys between middle C and high C on a piano. Pentatonic scales are used in African, East Asian, and Native American music, as well as in folk music.The lowest note in the scale is called the “key.” Usually, songs are written such that the last note of the song is the key note; a song written in the key of C almost always ends on the note C. A key name typically also includes whether the song is played under a major or minor scale; when the scale isn’t named, it’s understood to be the major scale.

, Sharps and flats raise and lower the pitches of notes by a half-step. They are necessary when playing in keys other than C-major or A-minor to keep the interval patterns for major and minor scales correct.

Sharps and flats are indicated in lines of written music with symbols called accidentals.

A sharp symbol, which resembles the hashtag (#), placed in front of a note raises its pitch by a half-step. In the keys of G-major and E-minor, the F is raised by a half-step to become F-sharp.
A flat symbol, which resembles a pointed lowercase “b,” placed in front of a note lowers its pitch by a half-step. In the keys of F-major and D-minor, the B is lowered by a half-step to become B-flat.
For the sake of convenience, the notes that must always be sharped or flatted in a particular key are indicated at the beginning of each line in the music staff in the key signature. Accidentals then have to be used only for notes outside the major or minor key the song is written in. When accidentals are used this way, they apply only to occurrences of that note before the vertical line that separates measures.
A natural symbol, which looks like a vertical parallelogram with a vertical line extending up and down from two of its vertices, is used in front of any note that would be otherwise be sharped or flatted to show that it shouldn’t be at that place in the song. Naturals never appear in key signatures, but a natural can cancel the effect of a sharp or flat used within a measure.

,


“Beat” refers to an individual pulse of music. A beat can be either a sounded note or a period of silence called a rest.A beat can also be divided among multiple notes, or multiple beats can be assigned to a single note or rest.
“Rhythm” refers to a series of beats or pulses.The rhythm is determined by how the notes and rests are arranged within a song.
“Tempo” refers to how fast or slowly a song is played. The faster the tempo, the more beats are played per minute. “The Blue Danube Waltz” has a slow tempo, while “The Stars and Stripes Forever” has a fast tempo.

, Measures are groups of beats. Each measure has the same number of beats. The number of beats each measure has is indicated in written music with a time signature, which looks like a fraction without a line separating the numerator and denominator.


The top number indicates the number of beats per measure. This number is usually a 2, 3, or 4, but may be as high as 6 or higher.
The bottom number indicates what kind of note gets a full beat. When the bottom number is a 4, a quarter note (looks like a filled oval with a line attached to it) gets a full beat. When the bottom number is a 2, a half note (looks like an open oval with a line attached to it) gets a full beat. When the bottom number is an 8, an eighth note (looks like a quarter note with a flag attached to it) gets a full beat.

, Rhythms are determined according to which beats in the measure are accented (stressed) and which beats are not (unstressed).


In most pieces of music, the first beat, or downbeat, is stressed. The remaining beats, or upbeats, are not stressed, although in a measure of four beats, the third beat may be stressed, but to a lesser degree than the downbeat. Stressed beats are also sometimes called strong beats, while unstressed beats are sometimes called weak beats.
Some pieces of music stress beats other than the downbeat. This type of stressing is known as syncopation, and beats so stressed are called back beats ., “Melody” is a succession of notes that the person listening to identifies as being a coherent song, based on the pitches of the notes and rhythm with which they are played.


Melodies are composed of phrases, which are groups of measures. These phrases may repeat throughout the melody, as in the Christmas carol “Deck the Halls,” where the first and second lines use the same sequence of measures.
A common melodic song structure is to have one melody for a verse and a related melody serve as a chorus or refrain.

, “Harmony” is the playing of notes outside those of the melody to either enhance or contrast its sound. As noted earlier, many stringed instruments actually generate multiple tones when plucked; the overtones that sound with the fundamental tone are a form of harmony. Harmony can be achieved through the use of musical phrases or chords.


Harmonies that enhance the sound of the melody are called “consonant.” The overtones that sound with the fundamental tone when the string of a guitar is plucked are a form of consonant harmony.
Harmonies that contrast with the melody are called “dissonant.”Dissonant harmonies can be created by playing several contrasting melodies at once, such as when singing “Row Row Row Your Boat” as a round, where each group starts singing at a different time.
Many songs use dissonance as a way to express unsettled feelings and gradually work toward consonant harmonies. In the example of the round of “Row Row Row Your Boat” above, as each group finishes singing its verse for the last time, the song becomes calmer until the last group sings “Life is but a dream.”

, A chord is formed when three or more notes are sounded, usually at the same time, but not always.


The most common chords are triads (three notes) where each successive note is two notes up from the previous note. In a C major chord, the notes are C (the chord root), E (the major third), and G (the fifth). In a C minor chord, the E is replaced with an E-flat (the minor third).
Another commonly used chord is the seventh chord, in which a fourth note is added to the triad, the seventh note up from the root. A C major seventh chord adds a B note to the C-E-G triad to make the sequence C-E-G-B. Seventh chords are more dissonant than triads.
It is possible to use a different chord for each individual note in a song; this is how barbershop quartet harmony is created.More commonly, however, chords are paired with notes found in the chord, such as playing a C major chord to accompany the E note in a melody.
Many songs are played with just three chords, those whose root notes are the first, fourth, and fifth notes in a scale. These chords are represented with the Roman numerals I, IV, and V. In the key of C major, these chords would be C major, F major, and G major. Often, a seventh chord is substituted for a V major or minor chord, so that when playing in C major, the V chord would be a G major seventh.
The I, IV, and V chords are interrelated between keys. While the F major chord is the IV chord in the key of C major, the C major chord is the V chord in the key of F major. The G major chord is the V chord in the key of C major, but the C major chord is the IV chord in the key of G major. This interrelationship carries through the rest of the chords and can be mapped as a diagram called the circle of fifths., Percussion instruments are considered one of the oldest forms of musical instrument. Most are used to create and keep rhythm, although a few can play the melody or create harmonies.Percussion instruments that produce sound by vibrating their entire bodies are called idiophones. These include instruments that are struck together, such as cymbals and castanets and those that are struck by something else, such as steel drums, triangles, and xylophones.
Percussion instruments with a “skin” or “head” that vibrates when struck are called membranophones. These include drums such as the timpani, tom-tom, and bongo, as well as instruments that attach a string or stick to the membrane that vibrates it when pulled or rubbed, such as the lion’s roar or cuica.

, Woodwind instruments produce sound by vibrating when blown. Most include tone holes to change the pitch of the sound they produce, thus making them suited for playing melodies and harmonies. Woodwinds are divided into two types: flutes, which produce sound by making the entire instrument body vibrate, and reed pipes, which vibrate material placed inside the instrument. These are further divided into two sub-types.Open flutes produce sound by splitting an airstream blown over the edge of the instrument. Concert flutes and panpipes are types of open flute.
Closed flutes channel air through a duct in the instrument to split it and make the instrument vibrate. The recorder and organ pipes are types of closed flute.
Single-reed instruments place a reed into the instrument mouthpiece. When blown into, the reed vibrates the air inside the instrument to produce sound. Clarinets and saxophones are examples of single-reed instruments. (Although a saxophone’s body is made of brass, it is considered a woodwind instrument because it uses a reed to make its sound.)
Double-reed instruments use two cane reeds bound together at one end instead of a single reed. Instruments such as the oboe and bassoon put the double reed directly between the player’s lips, while instruments like the crumhorn and bagpipes keep their double reeds covered.

, Unlike woodwind instruments, which rely solely on directing a stream of air, brass instruments vibrate along with the player’s lips to make their sound. While brass instruments are so named because most of them are made of brass, they are grouped according to their ability to change their sound by changing the distance through which the stream of air must travel before exiting. This is done through one of two methods.Trombones use a slide to change the distance the airstream must travel. Pulling the slide out lengthens the distance, lowering the tone, while pushing it in shortens the distance, raising the tone.
Other brass instruments, such as the trumpet and tuba, use a set of valves shaped like either pistons or keys to extend or shorten the airstream length within the instrument. These valves may be pressed singly or in combination to produce the desired sound.
Woodwind and brass instruments are often grouped together as wind instruments, since both must be blown into to make music.

, The strings of string instruments can be made to vibrate in one of three ways: by being plucked (as with a guitar), by being struck (as with a hammered dulcimer or the key-operated hammers on a piano), or by being sawed (as with the bow on a violin or cello). Stringed instruments can be used for either rhythmic or melodic accompaniment, and can be divided into three categories:Lutes are string instruments with a resonating body and a neck, such as violins, guitars, and banjos. They feature strings of equal length (except the low string on a five-string banjo) and varying thickness. Thicker strings produce a low tone, while thin strings produce a higher tone. Strings may be pinched off at marked points (frets) to effectively shorten them and raise their pitches.
Harps are string instruments whose strings are bound in a frame. Harps typically have strings of progressively shorter length arranged vertically, with the bottom end of the string connected to the resonating body, or soundboard.
Zithers are string instruments that are mounted onto a body. Their strings may be strummed or plucked, as with the autoharp, or struck directly, as with the hammered dulcimer, or indirectly, as with the piano.

Get the base.,
Find a tying device.,
Set up your guitar.,
Connect the band to the capo.,
Connect the capo to the guitar.,
Readjust the tightness.",How to Make a Capo with Office Materials," The base of the capo is the part that makes contact with the strings on your guitar. You have a few options for the base depending on what office supplies you have lying around. You can use a highlighter, pen, marker, or pencil.


The important thing to consider about the base of your capo is that it is long enough to cover the width of the fretboard.
If you have a short pencil or another shorter base, test it by comparing its length to the width of the fretboard.;
, You also have a few options with connecting the base of the capo to the guitar. The important part about the tying component is that it has enough pressure to hold the strings. You can either use a strong elastic band like a hair tie or rubber band, or you can use a piece of string.


If you use an elastic band, test it to make sure it is strong enough to hold the base against the strings.
Test the elastic band by stretching the band. You don’t need to stretch it too far, but make sure it doesn’t break on an initial test., Tune up your guitar before attaching the capo. You can either tune to standard tuning (EADGBE) or tune to an alternative tuning. Use a chromatic tuner for the most effective tuning.

, Tie one end of the band or string to the base. Secure a knot of the string near the edge of the base. This will create a permanent knot that is useful for fitting the capo to your guitar.


Loop the other end of the elastic band or string around your base. Detach the loop before attaching to the guitar.

, Put the base across the guitar neck at the fret desired, and loop the other end of the band around the other end of the base. This will secure the base over the strings. Make sure it is attached securely.Depending on what elastic band you use, you might need to double loop it to increase the pressure.
The pressure needs to be high to effectively press down the strings across the fret., Take it off and tie a knot on one end of the band to make it tighter. Repeat until the strings are pressed firmly against the strings. Test the capo by playing a chord or a few notes.


When you test the capo, play chords in the open position to test if the open strings sound good. The open strings are the notes that are affected by the capo."

, Ensure your Mac has sufficient battery, and open up the software. Close other programs for optimal performance.

, Before beginning work on any project, you must set the Tempo, Key, and Time Signature. This can be set up at the bar at the top that shows your project info.


You can always change the tempo of your project later. However, you cannot change the tempo with any tracked out instruments or vocals, as those are tracked out according to the tempo that was present when they were recorded. If you do need to change the tempo in such a scenario, you must re-record those particular components.
It is also recommended that you change your ""Count In"" settings before you record so you have a comfortable amount of room before your actual recording begins. You can do so by going into the ""Record"" option at the top of the bar, scrolling down to ""Count in"" and selecting what you are comfortable with.

, To create a new track, navigate your mouse to the ""Track"" option in the top bar and select ""New Track"". Select the first track you want to add in the arrange window.

, With your MIDI keyboard/synthesizer, you can emulate hundreds of different instruments through Logic's library.


From the new track window, click ""Software Instrument"". Select your instrument and make sure your MIDI workstation is connected and ready. Press ""R"" your keyboard to record.

, To correct any discrepancies in timing when recording software instruments, you can quantize that track to a certain time signature, based on its frequency in the recording.


To do so, first go into the inspector by clicking ""View"" at the top bar, and then ""Show Inspector"".
Select your track, then navigate to the ""Quantize"" option and select your particular timing. Those notes will automatically align themselves according to the timing you select.

, To record any real instrument you can either connect to the mixer or use a mic.


Make sure your instrument/mic is connected to the mixer, and is turned on.
Go to the ""New Track"" window, and select ""Audio"" as the option.

Consider your theme.,
Think creatively.,
Choose a nice mix.,
Be selective.,
Order your songs carefully.",How to Make a Mixtape1," Sometimes a mixtape will just be some of your favorite songs, but a really impressive mixtape has a theme and conveys a message. Think carefully about the person you are making the tape for and what you hope to express to them.;
, Different types of mixtape call for different stylistic approaches. A few of these are covered in greater detail below.

, A great mixtape may have some familiar songs and some songs that will be new to the recipient. Choose songs you like, and think your loved one will like, but don't be afraid to push their boundaries a little.

, Less is more! Don't just dump all your favorite songs onto your mixtape unless you are just trying to share some music. If you want to send a message, be spare with your selections. Use only what you need to say what you want, and no more.

, Putting tracks in the perfect order is part of the art of the mixtape. Consider the narrative, tonal, emotional and musical arc of the mixtape. Craft your songs into a story.

"
"
Brainstorm the track list.,
Listen to every potential song.,
Manage the length of the CD.,
Pay attention to the first and last song.,
Create peaks and valleys.,
Nurture the mix’s flow.",How to Make a CD Mix2," Before you start putting the songs into a playlist, you should spend time thinking of what songs you want. Browse through your music collection and start writing down songs that catch your eye with the audience and theme in mind. If you consider some songs you haven’t heard in a long time, play those and see if they fit with your intended feel. Don’t worry about writing down more songs than you need, because you can also narrow the list down later.

, There’s a good chance that you’ll pick some songs that you know are great but that you haven’t listened to in a while. It’s good to listen to the songs again just to refresh yourself on how they go. Maybe there is a lengthy intro that isn’t right for this mix, or a word of profanity somewhere that you want to avoid. Listening to the songs also helps you see if it really fits the tone and message of the CD that you are hoping to achieve.


It is also good to read the lyrics while you listen to make sure you don’t miss anything. You want to make sure there’s not a stray lyric or something you usually don’t notice when listening that someone else could pick up on. Examine lyric books or liner notes included in CDs you own, or visit one of the many lyrics websites available online.

, Using CDs means working within the storage limitations, which for most burnable CDs is around 80 minutes. When considering what your final mix will be, narrow down your list by checking song lengths. Pick the best set that fills the time available.

, Beginnings and endings don’t necessarily make or break the mix, but both will likely make an impact on the listener. Start out with a song that sets the tone you want the CD have and let it move forward from there. The last song is what you want the listener to feel once it is over. You can go out with a bang or let the tone mellow as the CD closes.

, This may be affected by what the purpose of the mix is, but for general listening, you don’t want the mix to be too heavy on one particular tempo or style. A whole CD of fast and loud songs might be right for the gym, but probably won’t be right for a long drive. Put a few songs in a row that build the intensity and then drop it down during the next couple of songs.Think of a DJ at a wedding reception or other party, and mimic their routines by trying to form patterns and keep a wide variety. You might use a pattern of fast, medium, slow, or loud, average, soft. But don’t repeat the exact pattern for the whole CD. Break the pattern partway through.

, This is similar to peaks and valleys, but with a focus more on content than on style and pacing. You want to create a CD that has a sort of unity and put the songs in an order that makes them fit together. You wouldn’t want to put Three Days Grace’s song “I Hate Everything About You” next to Michael Jackson’s “The Way You Make Me Feel.” Try to put songs next to each with lyrical content that seems somewhat similar rather than completely opposite.This is much more of an art than a science, so it will not be perfect. You just want the mix to feel like it was put together in a specific way on purpose, not a bunch of songs that are on shuffle.

Wait for the disc to finish.",How to Make a CD Mix3," With iTunes open, click the word File in the top left corner. A drop down list should appear, and you’ll find the option that says New. Hover over that, and you’ll see Playlist. Click that. A new playlist will appear in the list on the side of the window. Go ahead and name it something that tells the purpose of the mix you are making. If you work on this project in multiple sittings, you want to remember which playlist you are working on if you have multiple playlists., Assuming the music you want to put on the mix is already in your iTunes, search through and find the songs, then drag them over to the playlist. For right now, the order that you add them in is not important because you can go through and reorder once the songs are in the playlist.If some of the songs you want to include on the CD are not already in your music library, you may need to add those songs. You can either import them from CDs you have or download them from iTunes.

, Once you have all of the songs you want in your playlist, you need to rearrange them into the order you want. You can do this by clicking and holding on the song and dragging it to the position you want it in. When you get the songs to a place where you think they’ll fit well, listen to the beginnings and endings of the songs to see if they transition well from one to the next.

, Assuming your computer is equipped with a CD burner, a window might pop up asking what you want to do, and if there is a Burn CD option, click that. If not, go back up to File and click the option that says Burn Playlist to Disc. You can also hold Ctrl and click on the playlist title and the option to Burn Playlist to Disc should appear. Click that.

, When you click Burn Playlist to Disc, a new window with Burn Settings should appear, and you’ll have some options. You can leave everything as default and simply hit Burn, or you can change the time gap between songs, file type, and sound levels. If you are new to burning CDs, it is best to leave the settings alone and hit Burn., Once you’ve clicked Burn, your work is pretty much done. iTunes will begin burning your disc, which takes a varying amount of time depending on how many songs you’ve chosen and how fast your computer is. In general, it takes 5-10 minutes. Your computer may eject the disc automatically when it is finished burning or you may have to hit eject manually.

This will open a panel on the right side of your screen that will be the place where you drag the songs you want to burn. This tab does not start burning the CD, it simply opens the panel for you to make the song list.

, If you have made a playlist in media player ahead of time, you can drag the whole playlist and it will add to the Burn list. If you still need to search through your library and find them, do so and drag each one to the list separately. If you don’t add them in the order you want them in, you can rearrange once they are in the Burn panel., This button will either be at the top under the tabs marked Play, Burn, and Sync, or it may be at the bottom of the window by itself. Once you click this, the program will start burning the CD automatically, so make sure you don’t click it until you have the songs arranged how you want them.

Add a name.,
Add art.,
Make it sparkle.,
Replace the labels.,
Screw around with the content of the tape.,
Give your mixtape a a background track.",How to Make a Mixtape2," All but the most mundane mixtapes will benefit from having a name. At the very least, a descriptive name will help the recipient keep track of what's on the tape (for example, “2010s folk music”).


If it's special, make it sound special. For more tightly themed mixtapes, there is an art to coming up with the perfect name.
Using the name of the person who will receive the mixtape can be very flattering to them. A name can also be used as part of a statement addressed directly to the recipient.
Using a favorite lyric from one of the songs on the tape is a good way to center every song on the tape around that lyric, and encourage the recipient to think about the tape in that context.
A name that succinctly reflects the theme can help make sense of the song order you choose for the tape. A mixtape named “dawn to dusk,” for instance, suggests a very specific arc of music.

, This doesn't necessarily mean a tiny painting or a sketch (although those are fine), it means any kind of cassette decoration you can put some effort into to create a finished product that's unique and unmistakable.


Color it in. Colored markers are a time-honored tool of the cassette decorator's trade. They can brightly decorate any paper surface with minimal trouble. Try an abstract pattern or oversized, multicolored lettering. Even a plain black marker can cloak a cassette case insert in zebra stripes or dense spirals.

, Sequins and glitter add flash with just a bit of thin glue and a paintbrush. Be careful not to get anything on the actual tape inside the cassette, and avoid putting anything that isn't flat (like a rhinestone) on the cassette or CD itself, or the recipient may have trouble getting it to play. Save such decorations for the outside of the case.

, With a bit of planning and some care, the cassette or CD case insert and even the tape label itself can be custom-made from scratch


Use cloth-top medical tape for a nice wide label that takes marker very well.
Carefully cut out a photograph or part of a magazine article and firmly glue it onto the tape (with proper holes cut out of it for the tape reels) to make a completely new label.
Use the case insert as a backing board for a collage.

, If you're an experienced and confident mixtape creator, take your tape to the next level by filling in every possible gap between the songs to create a continuous sonic experience.

, This takes some finesse, and causes sound quality to suffer a bit, but the result is worth the trouble.


Get a long recording of something that isn't quite music, such as a poetry recital, a comedy routine, or a soundtrack of old TV commercials, and record it onto both sides of your tape first.
Carefully plan your songs out – you won't get any second chances to re-record them without messing up the tape.
Record your mixtape over the previous recording, leaving gaps of a few seconds each between songs. The gaps in your mixtape will be filled with the previous recording for an interesting and attention-grabbing effect.
Paint a sonic landscape with filler tracks. Scrape together all the short songs (less than a minute) you can find, and use them to fill in the gaps at the end of each side of the tape. They'll serve as bookends, framing the rest of the mix in a different light.
For an even more ambitious project, include any sound bites you can find in larger songs that are only a couple of seconds long, and manually record one of them between each of your regular songs as you make the tape.

The best ways are burning a CD, putting your music onto a small flash drive, or simply sending your tape over the Internet.

, Organize your songs into a playlist and add digital album art. Then burn your CD.



Decorate your CD and CD case. Give your CD case an eye-catching cover and include the track listing on the back.

, Gather the files into a folder on your computer. Rename each one with a number in front of the title to put them in the proper order. Include a .txt or .doc file with any track information you wish to add, as well as your cover art. Drag the folder into your flash drive's icon on your computer.


Since flash drives are usually small, consider putting yours in an envelope or taping it to a card before handing it off. This way you can include some physical decorations or a handwritten note and make it harder to lose.

, Gather your mix into a folder and include track listing documentation and album art. Perhaps compress the folder into a zip file. Use your preferred method to send your file to your mix's recipient.

Choose your length. There are a few different lengths of blank cassette tape commonly available. The best lengths for making a mixtape are 60 minutes (30 on each side) or 90 minutes (45 on each side). Avoid 120 minute cassettes, as their sound quality is considerably lower.

, Once you've settled on a track list list (get some ideas below), stack your recorded music so that you can work your way through the stack from top to bottom as you make the mixtape. This will help keep you from losing track of the project as you record.


If you are able to get lengths for each track, do so. This will help you organize your songs around the break that comes halfway through the tape.

, If your music collection is primarily digital but you would still like to make an old-fashioned cassette mixtape, all is not lost. Burn the songs you want to use onto blank CDs using your computer's optical recording drive, and then record to the tape from the CDs. Be sure that you burn a music disc and not a data disc, since data discs won't work with every kind of stereo.


Alternatively, if you have a way to run your MP3 player's audio through your stereo, you can record directly from it onto the tape. Be aware that sound quality will typically take a hit if you use this method, compared to the CD method.

, There are cords that should be able to do this for most cassette players.


If you can, use an integrated setup. Most stereo and hi-fi systems manufactured over the last few decades have a cassette recorder built into one of their integrated tape decks. Look for the tape deck with an extra button, which usually has a red dot on it.

, Let the tape play for a few seconds, until the sound changes to a smooth hiss, and then stop it.

, Put the first album you are copying a song from into the appropriate player on the stereo or hi-fi.


For CDs, pause the playback and skip tracks until you reach the track you want.
For other cassettes, fast-forward to the song, and then stop or pause the tape.
For LPs, leave the dust cover up and wait for a moment.

, Push the “record” button on the recorder deck (this will push the “play” button down automatically as well), and then start playing the song you picked. Pushing “record” first ensures that none of the song gets clipped off at the start.


If you're recording from an LP, drop the the needle just before the song you want to record, and once the record reaches the silent space between tracks, push “record” on the tape deck.

, Stay close to the stereo and push the “stop” button on the recorded deck as soon as your song is finished. This will stop the recording. You can then stop the first album and switch it out for the next song on your mixtape list.

, When your cassette reaches the end of the first side, it's time to flip it over and continue on the back.

, Listen to your mixtape through to make sure everything recorded correctly. If a song didn't come out right, record of that part of the tape until you are satisfied.


Unless you carefully budgeted your time, it's likely that you'll end up with part of a song at the end of the first side. You can erase songs from your mixtape by recording over them while no music is playing.

, Consider adding cover art, decorations, and other finishing touches.

It needs to cover your entire midsection, from your bust down to your hips, but it does not need to extend over your hips.


A leotard or bodysuit could also work well. Just make sure that whatever base you start with is a solid green, rather than a patterned green.
A green corset or structured bodysuit would also work well and might even be easier to work with. These tend to be more expensive, though, and it might also be harder to find one in the right shade of green.;
, Use a needle and green thread to attach individual ivy leaves to the front of the bodysuit.


Attach the leaves by weaving the thread into the back of the bodysuit, through the center of each leaf, and back down through the leaf and bodysuit. Repeat this several times for each leaf to secure the centers in place.
Create a climbing ivy pattern by having a consistent line of ivy running from the top of the costume to the bottom. The entire top should of the bodysuit should be lined with leaves, while the center of the costume can have as few or as many leaves as desired winding down it.
If you use a corset instead of a bodysuit, you could simply glue the leaves onto place using a hot glue gun. This can be problematic with more flexible materials, however, since it will make the costume stiffer and harder to slip on.
You will likely need four to six bundles of fake ivy for this project.
For added flair, you could also paint each leaf with red and green glitter. This is not necessary, though.

,


For an added touch, look for a camisole that has a little lace pattern toward the top. While not part of the classic Poison Ivy look, this feminine detail certainly plays into the ""femme fatale"" flair of the character.

, The skirt should drape well and loosely match the color of your bodysuit. A short pixie-style skirt should suffice.


You can wear this costume without the skirt, but adding one can provide an appropriate degree of modesty if you feel uncomfortable showing off so much of your figure.
Alternatively, you could make a simple cape-skirt by attaching sheer green fabric to a belt. Measure out enough fabric to fit comfortably around your waist. The fabric should also be knee-length or longer for this option. Attach it to a green belt by sewing or gluing one side of the fabric rectangle to the belt. You could also add a layer of green lace to the skirt to mimic the look of leaves.

, The most traditional Poison Ivy costumes include long green gloves that reach up to your elbow.


Make sure that the shade of green used for your gloves differs from that of the bodysuit. If the bodysuit is dark, go with a lighter shade of green. If the bodysuit is light or a medium shade, opt for a dark green.
You could also mimic the look of gloves by wrapping rectangles of fabric around your arm. These rectangles should extend from the elbow down to the risk. Sew or glue them together. Using green lace fabric can mimic the appearance of ivy leaves.

,


The shade of green used for the tights may vary depending on the green used for your bodysuit. If the bodysuit is fairly dark, use lighter tights. If the bodysuit is fairly light or a medium shade of green, use darker tights.
In a pinch, green leggings will also work. You simply need something skin-tight and green to cover your legs.
If you cannot find green tights, you could get a pair of white tights and dye them green using cheap clothing dye. The advantage of using this option is that you can also dye white gloves and white boots to match your tights exactly.
For added decoration, use a needle and thread to attach a few stray leaves of fake ivy along the legs. You do not need much, however, and too much can actually distract from the shape of the costume.

, Ideally, the boots should match the color of the gloves and should extend up to the mid-calf or knee.


Both flat and heeled boots can work, but opt for a lower heel rather than a notably tall one.
You can also get white boots and color them green using dye or fabric spray paint.

, Poison Ivy traditionally has long, bright red hair. Dye your hair using the brightest shade of temporary red hair dye you can find.


Note that if you have dark hair, you may need to lighten it first before applying the red hair dye. Otherwise, you may end up producing a deep burgundy color, which is a little less accurate to the character.
If you would like to avoid dying your hair, you could simply use a red wig. Look for a wavy red wig that extends past your shoulders but not past your mid-back for the most classic Poison Ivy look.
If using a wig, you could decorate it further by sewing a handful of individual fake ivy leaves into the back.

, Instead of trying to paint on ""Poison Ivy eyebrows"" with make-up or body paint, you can create the look with an ivy-covered cat eye mask.


Cat eye masks are slanted dramatically above the eyebrow, giving them the perfect shape for your Poison Ivy costume.
Start with a green mask if at all possible. While the entire mask should be covered with leaves, using a green mask will prevent any other colors from slipping through if there are gaps between your leaves.
Attach small ivy leaves around the mask. Start at the inside corners of each eye, and make sure that the leaves point outward instead of in. You should also be careful so that the leaves do not cover up the eye holes.
Use craft glue or hot glue to secure the leaves in place.

, There are several ways you can do this, but green eyeshadow should definitely be the key focal point of your eyes.


Start by applying a medium shade of green to the lid of the eye. Draw a line of dark green in the crease of your eye with dark green eye shadow, and cover everything from the crease to the bottom of the eyebrow with light green eye shadow.
Alternatively, apply burnt orange eyeshadow to the lid, dark green to the crease, and medium green to the upper eye.
You could also apply dark green eyeshadow to the lid, burnt orange to the crease, and light to medium green above the crease.
Glitter eyeshadow can be used for added drama.

, A deep green or dark brown eyeliner can further emphasize your eyes. Apply an even, smudged line to the top lid only.

, Your eyelashes should be long and voluptuous. Use green or black mascara to coat and curl your upper lash line.


If your eyelashes are naturally thick, you can get away with simply curling them using an eyelash curler.
Instead of applying mascara, you could also attach fake eyelashes to your eyes.

, The red should be at least as bright as your hair color, if not even brighter. For an alternate approach, you could also use green lipstick, but it will be harder to find.

Think of a specific reason.,
Settle on a theme.,
Search for songs that fit your theme.,
Narrow the playing field.",How to Make a Mixtape5," “Just because” is a fine excuse to make a mixtape, but “you made me smile yesterday and I can't figure out how you did it” is better. Your reason will suggest themes, which can be adopted to make the mixtape more cohesive.

, It doesn't necessarily have to be connected to your reason for making the mixtape, but you should choose something you think your boyfriend or girlfriend will appreciate. Using the example above, you might come up with a theme of songs that mention smiling.

, Feel free to use novel or unorthodox interpretations of your theme to help you find more songs. Get as many songs together as you can and listen to all of them, or at least parts of all of them.


Keep trying until you get it right. If you just can't seem to scrape together enough music to fill a blank tape, try to come up with a different theme instead.

, Think about what your significant other likes, what you like, and how you want the theme to be expressed. Think about whether or not you can create a deeper message out of your songs by putting them in a certain order. With a little luck, you'll be able to whittle down your selections to just about the right amount to fit onto a mixtape.


Spend a lot of time on the order of your songs. Order is important for this type of themed mixtape; a good song order allows the songs to flow from one to the next in a way that makes sense and adds meaning. Working all this extra detail into your mixtape is also a great way to show your significant other how much love you've poured into making it for them.

Hear with the recipient's ears.,
Pick your tracks based on what you think they will like.",How to Make a Mixtape6," Very often when you make a mixtape for a parent or other older relative, it is intended to be a way for them to sample new music. If you're going to show them a lot of new music, spend some time trying to guess whether or not they'll actually enjoy listening to any of it first. Remember, this person has very different musical tastes than you do.

, For this kind of mixtape, pick the catchiest and most accessible songs you can think of within the confines of whatever type of music you're planning to give away.


Use your past as a guide. If you can't figure out which tracks those might be, think back to the first time you heard the albums in question. What tracks immediately caught your attention? Even if you've moved on from them now, those are the tracks most likely to make a good impression on people who haven't heard the music before.

"
"
Keep other people in mind.,
Think of the children.,
Be a team player.,
Use a simple theme.,
Consider donating your tape to work.",How to Make a Mixtape7," Assuming that you are bringing your tape to work with the intention of playing it over the speakers so you can listen to it while you do your job, the most important consideration (aside from picking songs you like) is the wants and preferences of the other people who will hear the tape.

, If you work in a customer environment where children and families might be present, you should avoid songs with swearing or adult themes like violence and drug use.

, Try to pick songs you think your coworkers will enjoy, rather than just whichever tracks you feel like listening to at the moment.

, Deeper themes require a flow not just from song to song, but across different styles and sounds of music, which won't translate well in most workplaces. Instead, pick a plain and simple theme like “songs about days of the week” or “blues songs that sound like summer afternoons.” That way, when your coworkers hear the first song, they'll know what to expect from the rest of the tape and be able to get back to focusing on work.

, If it's a big hit with your coworkers, think about leaving it there permanently for anyone to use whenever they feel like hearing it. The point of making a mixtape, generally speaking, is to give it to someone else anyway, so just think of it as a natural next step in the process.

Get some comic-printed fabric.,
Choose a pair of plain high heels.,
Cut a piece of fabric big enough to cover one shoe.,
Cut a slit down the middle of the fabric for the opening.,
Use a foam brush to coat the toe area with a thick layer of fabric glue.,
Smooth the fabric down onto the glue.,
Cover the sides of the shoe with more glue, and smooth the fabric down into the glue.,
Trim one side of the fabric down until it goes ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) past the back seam, and glue it down.,
Trim the other side of the fabric until it goes 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) past the seam.,
Fold the raw edge under itself, then glue the fabric down.,
Shape the top opening.,
Glue the fabric inside your shoe.,
Trim the excess fabric away along the sole.,
Seal the fabric along the sole for extra security.,
Consider covering the heel area as well.,
Seal the fabric with Mod Podge, or another type of sealer, if desired.This may not be necessary if you used fabric glue, but it would be a good idea if you used Mod Podge.,
Let your shoes dry completely before you wear them.",How to Make Comic Book High Heels1," You can buy comic-printed fabric from the fabric store.You can also buy a comic-printed shirt or skirt, and use that instead; make sure that the fabric is cotton and non-stretch.;
, Fabric shoes would work best for this, because the glue will stick better. If your shoes are made out of patent leather, or a similar material, lightly buff them with fine-grit sandpaper or an emery board; this will give the glue something to grab on to.


If there are any embellishments on your shoes, be sure to cut them off; you can always glue them back on later.

, The easiest way to do this would be to lay the fabric on top of the shoe, and then to cut around it.This method is just for one shoe. You'll need to repeat it for your other shoe. It is easiest to work on one shoe at a time.

, Keep the fabric on top of the shoe and position your scissors just above the heel seam. Cut straight down the fabric until you are ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) away from the top of the opening (closest to the toe)., You can also use a decoupage glue, such as Mod Podge, but make sure that it is waterproof.

, Make sure that the fabric is stretched over the surface of the shoe, and that there aren't any puckers or wrinkles.

, Try your best to follow the curves of the heels. Don't worry about the top opening just yet. When you get close to the heel of the shoe, stop.


You can leave the heels covered or uncovered. If you plan on covering them, skip over them for now; you will need to use a separate piece of fabric for that.

, Pat some glue onto the heel of your shoe first, then press the fabric down onto the glue, making sure to pull it nice and taut., You are including this extra fabric so that you can fold it under itself and create a finished seam. Don't glue it down just yet, however., For a more secure finish, coat the underside of the fabric with glue first, then fold the raw edge under itself by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). Brush on some glue under the fabric, then press it down onto the shoe., Go back to where you cut the slit, and cut the opening out until it is ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) away from the edge of the shoe. Next, cut slits into the fabric. Make the slits further apart along the straight edges of the shoe, and closer together in the curved areas (such as the toe). This will help the fabric lay smoother inside your shoe, and prevent wrinkling and buckling, which might make your shoes uncomfortable to wear.If your heels are peep-toes, use a similar technique: trim the fabric down to ½ inch (1.27 centimeters), then cut slits into it.

, Many crafters find that the inside of shoes doesn't take glue well for some reason. To ensure that the fabric stays down, brush glue onto the shoe and the fabric, then press the fabric down. If the fabric still won't stay down, secure it with metal clips until the glue dries.


If your shoes are peep-toes, use a similar technique: glue the fabric down, then secure it with clips until it dries.

, The easiest way to do this would be to run a craft blade down the seam between your shoe and the sole.This may even tuck the fabric into the seam.


If you have a lot of excess fabric, you can trim it away with a pair of scissors first.

, Run some fabric glue along the seam where the body of your shoe joins the sole. Next, run something blunt along the seam to tuck the raw edges in. You can use your fingernail, a butter knife, a skewer, or even a knitting needle to do this., Start by measuring the height and circumference of your heel. Next, add 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) to the height, and 1½ inches (3.81 centimeters) to the length. Cut the fabric out, then do the following:


Fold the bottom and one of the side edges down by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters).
Cover the heel with glue.
Wrap the fabric around it, starting with the raw edge and finishing with the folded edge. Keep the seam on the inside of the heel.
Run a craft blade along the top seam of your heel to cut away any excess fabric. This should also tuck the raw top edges into the seam.

, If your fabric has any glue ""stains"" on it, then coating it with Mod Podge or sealer would help hide them. Whatever you decide to use, make sure that it is waterproof.


It might be an even better idea to add 2 to 3 coats of Mod Podge or sealer. Make sure that you let each coat dry before applying the next.

, Even though the glues and sealers you used are waterproof, it would be best to avoid getting these shoes wet. If you get them wet, the fabric may start to bubble and warp.

Get a red spandex mask.,
Buy a pair of large-frame sunglasses.,
Use window tint for the eyes.,
Buy a black Sharpie, black fabric paint or puff paint.,
Get a hot glue gun.,
Lay your mask out flat.,
Sketch out the eyes.,
Cut out the mask's eyes.,
Take out the sunglasses' lenses.,
Hot glue the lenses inside the mask.,
Draw the eye borders.,
Draw on webs.,
Let it dry.,
Try it on.",How to Make a Spider Man Mask," Many online vendors sell spandex face-masks, called Morph Masks. If you're planning on making a Spiderman suit to go with your mask, you can buy a full-body Morph Suit as well. Look for a plain red Morph Mask at a costume depot or order one online. It should cost around 15 dollars.;
, There are many different versions of Spiderman, between the comics and the films. Some Spiderman costumes feature dark eye-lenses, while others show a Spiderman with bright, reflective eyes. Buy a large pair of sunglasses in the tint that you prefer for your costume, dark or bright.Make sure the glasses have very large lenses. Each lens will become an eye on your mask, so take some reference pictures of Spiderman with you when you go shopping. Look in the women's sunglasses section, as many women's styles feature larger lenses.

, For an alternative look, consider using a sheet of silver or dark auto tint for the eyes of your mask. It will make for a similar effect as the sunglasses, but the material is flexible instead of rigid. You can ask an auto detailing shop if they have any scraps, then cut it into the shape of the eyes. You won't need very much, so they should be able to help you out., To create the ""web"" pattern on Spiderman's mask, you'll have to decide between a black Sharpie or black fabric paint. This will depend on your aesthetic preference. Sharpie will create flat, matte lines, while puff paint or fabric paint will create raised, textured lines. Be aware that you may have to hand-wash your mask regardless of which marker type you choose. Both can be damaged by machine washing., Many craft stores carry inexpensive hot glue guns. Pick one up or use one that you already own. Make sure that you have plenty of glue sticks handy so that you don't run out in the middle of your project.

, Lay the spandex mask on a flat surface, like a table or desk. Make sure you lay it with the front facing up, because you'll obviously want to draw the eyes on the front of the mask. If you have a styrofoam head or dummy head, feel free to use this as well. It will give you a better vantage point for designing your mask and visualizing it on your own head., Using a pencil or a ballpoint pen, sketch out the size and shape of the eyes that you want. Use a reference photo to get an idea of how you want the eyes to look, relative to the mask size. Remember to check your sunglasses against the eye size: you want the sunglasses' lenses to be larger than the size of the eyes.

, Put one hand inside the mask, then hold a pair of scissors with your other hand. Carefully pierce a hole directly on the line of one eye, then begin to cut along the line. Once the first eye is completely cut out, do the same for the second eye. Make sure that your scissors are sharp and your hands are steady, otherwise your cuts could turn out jagged or uneven.Look at photos of Spiderman as a reference to get an idea of the shape of the eyes. In most incarnations of Spiderman, his eyes are roughly triangular, with a straight line on top and a U-shaped line forming the lower eyelid.

, The lenses of most sunglasses will pop out easily when you apply pressure. Hold the frame with both hands, then push out the lenses gently with your thumbs. Make sure not to push too hard, or the lenses might break., Let your hot glue gun warm up, then apply a thin line to the outside of one lens. Holding the neck of the mask open with one hand, use your other hand to move the glued lens inside of the mask. Hold the lens directly under one of the eye holes, then adhere the glue to the fabric inside the mask. Make sure that the eye hole is completely filled by the lens, and that there are no gaps.Apply the second lens. Using the exact same method, glue a thin line to the other lens and then affix it to the inside of the mask, creating the second eye.
If you place the lens incorrectly at first, you will have a few seconds to move it before the glue dries. Apply light pressure to the side of the lens to fill the eye-hole while the glue is still hot.
The glue will take around 15 seconds to set, so keep in mind the amount of time you have left to make changes.

, Spiderman has thick black borders around both eyes, so you'll need to draw these on. Using your sharpie or fabric paint, sketch out a 1/2"" border around each eye, then fill it in completely. If you are feeling a bit more ambitious, cut out some black fabric from an old t-shirt in the correct shape, then hot-glue it on.

, Look in a comic book or online for a reference photo, then copy Spiderman's web patterns onto the mask. If you're uncomfortable free-handing the webs, try sketching them on with a pencil first, then erasing and adjusting till they're just right. Then, use your Sharpie or Fabric paint to draw over the penciled lines., Now that your mask has been hot-glued and accented, you'll need to let it dry. Read your bottle of fabric paint and the hot-glue instructions for specific times. The glue itself may dry in around a minute, but fabric paint may take up to 72 hours to dry, depending on the brand., Once your mask has dried, go ahead and try it on. Pair it with a homemade Spiderman costume, or wear it on its own. It'll be perfect for Halloween, Super Hero events, or costume parties.

Modern Robin wears a yellow belt. Glue a yellow circle made out of fun foam on the buckle.

, Robin wears a long cape in addition to his costume. The type of Robin you want to be depends on what color cape you should wear.

, The best heels to use for this project are ones that are made out of fabric or suede becuase the Mod Podge will stick to them better. If your heels are made out of patent leather, or a similar shiny material, light buff them with fine-grit sand paper or an emery board instead; this will give the Mod Podge something to stick to.If there are any embellishments on your shoes, be sure to cut them off; you can always glue them back on later.

, Go through your book, and look for various characters, scenes, sound effects, and speech bubbles that you want to put on your shoes.


Many comic book shoes also have ""statement"" images. These are images that are a little larger than the rest, and are meant to stand out.

, You can cut them down further into various shapes as well, such as squares, rectangles, and triangles. Make sure that you have some small and large shapes. This will make fitting them into the contours of your shoes a lot easier and reduce wrinkles. Make sure that the pieces you cut are no bigger than 1 inch (2.54 centimeters).If you are cutting out statement images, make sure that you follow their outlines. For example, if you want to cut out an image of Wonder Woman's head, make sure that you follow the outline of her hair, face, and neck. A craft blade or tiny pair of scissors would be best for this.Consider separating your shapes into groups based on size or color. This will make it easier to find the pieces you need for your design.

, Only put down enough glue to apply 2 to 3 comic book scraps. Depending on the material you are working with, the may dry within minutes. Working in small patches at a time will prevent the glue from drying out too quickly.


You can use any type of decoupage glue you want, but make sure that it is waterproof.

, This will make the paper extra-damp and pliable. It will be easier to smooth the paper over the curves of your shoe., Make sure that you are placing your comic book scrap glue-side-down. You can also smooth it out with your fingers first before adding the glue on top. This will smooth down any wrinkles and loose edges.

, Use larger pieces of paper on the flat areas, and smaller pieces on the curved areas. When you get to the top edge, fold the paper over to the inside of the shoe. If the paper won't stay down, secure it with metal clips.


You do not need to cover the entire shoe. For example, you can leave the heels and soles bare for a different look.
If you are adding any ""statement"" images, don't glue them down yet; you'll be adding those at the very one, after everything has dried.

, Take a close look at your shoe. If there are any imperfections, peel the paper off, and apply a new scrap. At this point, you can also run a craft blade along the seam where the shoe meets the sole, and peeling away any excess paper.


If there is any glue left on the sole, use a damp towel to wipe it away.

, Use the same technique as before: brush some decoupage glue onto your shoe and onto the back of the image, place the image on your shoe, and smooth it down with more glue. Once you have all of your statement images applies, give them a final coating of glue, making sure to go well past the edges to seal them. , Let each coat of glue dry before you add the next one.You can use any type of finish you want: matte, satin, or glossy. Whichever finish you choose, make sure that it is waterproof.


You can also use an acrylic sealer instead, as long as it is waterproof.

, If you cut off any embellishments earlier that you want to keep, glue them back onto your shoes using hot glue or an industrial-strength glue.

Gather your materials.,
Insert your cardboard inside the shirt.,
Paint a large yellow rectangle on the center of the shirt.,
Paint brown shell lines on the yellow rectangle.",How to Make a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Costume2," Your top half is what you're most concerned about. For your legs, wear green sweatpants (that ideally match your t-shirt). Those will be left mostly alone, but the shirt will need to be turtle-fied. Here's what you need:

A green t-shirt or sweatshirt






Yellow and brown fabric paint






Paper plates






A foam paintbrush






Cardboard







, This will separate the sides, keeping the paint from seeping through. If you don't have cardboard, use some other sturdy material that you're not worried about getting paint on.


Lay the shirt flat and smooth out all the creases. The cardboard insert needs to be the just short of the width of the shirt when laid out.
If you're using a t-shirt, consider wearing a sweatshirt underneath that is your turtle's color.

, For ideas or a template, go online and see artists' depictions of the Turtles or other costume designs. The yellow is the bottom of the shell -- make it fitting to your size.


It's easiest to use a paper plate as your palette. You can just throw it/them away afterward and not worry about the mess.

, Because there have been so many variations over the years, it's impossible to say 100% what the shell looks like. But a good standard design includes a thin line just inside the border of the yellow and lines separating the block into six squares, with one line down the middle.


If you're going for super-strength turtle, you may want to make your lines look more like abs. Go work on the shell while you let the shirt dry.

Draw the turtle shell pattern on your pan.,
Paint or apply duct tape to the shell.,
Poke two holes in the top and bottom of your foil pan.,
Thread the ribbon through the top hole.",How to Make a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Costume3," This part is a bit ambitious and a little messy, so clear off the table, lay down some newspaper, grab a drink and sit down to work. Here's what you'll need:

A large foil turkey pan






Lots of newspaper (in addition to what's covering your workspace)






Papier mâché supplies -- bowl, water, white glue or flour






Scissors






Brown and dark green paint (or duct tape)






A drill (or something to poke holes through the pan with)






Wide brown ribbon







, Basically, take the sides and push them out a bit and round out the inner edges, too. While you're at it, just round out the entire thing. Everything needs to be a bit more circular.

, Using 2 parts glue or 1 part flour, make a paste with water and cut 2 in (5 cm) wide strips of newspaper. The length doesn't really matter.


Cover the entire outside of your shell. Go in every direction, creating an even layer. If you'd like to add texture by bunching up your strips, you can -- but the shape of the pan should already be fairly shell-like.
Let dry for a couple of hours.

, If it's easier, paint your shell white beforehand. Grab a hexagonal template off the internet and trace it -- the shell sort of looks like a soccer ball...sort of. But ultimately the shell is up to you -- horizontal lines work, too.


You'll be painting or taping over it, so don't worry if you have dark lines. They'll get covered up.

, Use green duct tape and brown paint (or vice versa) if you'd like to go for a more textured look. Paint is much easier to work with, but duct tape makes it look sturdier.


If painting, you may have to put on several coats. Be patient. Let dry after you've finished.

, That's four in total. Straps are going to be attached through these holes, so place them like you would see them on a backpack.

It's easiest to use a drill, but anything that can pop through the foil will do. If you don't use a drill, keep the hole to drill-size.

, Don't cut it yet -- you don't know how much you need. Place the pan on your back. Once you go through the top with the ribbon, put it over your shoulder and through the bottom. Leave 3 or 4 inches (7.5 - 10 cm) extra for making knots and cut. Then, take that length and cut another piece for the other side.


Tie knots to the top and bottom. It's best if you have the pan on your back while doing this, so grab a friend to make the knots for you.

, Cut it so it fits like a loose belt.

, They need only be about 3"" (7.5 cm) in diameter. Draw the letter of your turtle on the white paper (in the appropriate color) and attach to the cardboard.

, Tape is easiest, though glue and staples will do as well. If you don't want a tie in your belt, use the circle to join (and hide) the ends together.


The letter should be worn front and center. Make the belt tight enough that it doesn't rotate too much.

, You can identify which turtle you are by having a headband, armbands, and leg bands in your turtles color. Where the headband across your forehead, the armbands around your bicep, and the leg bands around your calf.

If your ribbon is wide enough, you could always cut eye holes in it and use it as a mask instead!

, Again, do this in your turtle's color. This is a simple alternative to having to mess with a bandana wrapped around your head that you still have to see out of.


Paint up to the eyebrow, just below the eye, a thin bridge around the nose, and lines to the ears. Their masks weren't that wide.

, Now it's time to go to town with quilt batting or pillow stuffing -- unless you already have the body of a body builder. Stuff your chest, biceps, and thighs. Sculpt it to your liking.


Stuffing your costume isn't necessary, no. But it will make your costume even more noticeable than it already is!

Prepare well.,
Price the works.,
Look on line for Call for Entry.,
A contract needs to be signed between the artist and gallery.,
Come up with a name.,
Ask trusted friends for name suggestions, keywords and the feeling one gets when viewing your art.,
Identify your own technique and style, range of subjects and theme to fully enhance the title of the show.,
Get some help with titles.,
Be as descriptive as possible.",How to Name Your Solo Art Exhibition," Preparation for your solo exhibition is essential. Keep in mind that the work meets the following criteria:


Is it all made using safe, solid materials secured so nothing can come un-glued, smear, or fall off? 
Is the work ready to hang? 
Do certain works need support rods or Plexiglas to cover it, or a pedestal to display it? 


You will need to address all of this. Each level of artistic quality should show a sign of sophistication, a website, write-ups, online articles and publications about your art. Name recognition is highly desirable.





;
, Original art needs to be priced based on the artist’s status of being a new, emerging or master artist. A new artist is one with basic art skills, but has never really exhibited their art work before. Keeping a portfolio of work, showing your growth is essential for all new artists. New artists will probably do best in a group show at first.

, You will need to pay about $20-35 dollars to participate, but you will see how your art work stands up in competition. An emerging artist has some exhibition experience, publicity and a following. Master Artists are well-known, get top dollar for art, and work with galleries to sell their work or get commissions.

, The contract will state the artist’s responsibilities, delivery date, photos for press, a list of works and prices and an artist biography. The gallery will state their duty to provide space, advertise, and support for the artist. Some galleries do charge up to 50% commission to provide for publicity and staff.

, Naming the exhibition is usually the duty of the artist and this can be daunting. For many art spaces, calendars are set up to a year in advance. An artist typically shows examples of current work, but may want to focus on a new direction for the solo show. You may have no idea how the new work will turn out, and therefore it will be difficult to describe it.

, Is one word often reoccurring, such as bright, comforting, symbolic, intriguing, youthful, realistic?

, What makes your artwork stand out from all other artists?

, If you are still stuck, there are title generators out there.  An example of this is Rebecca Uchill’s curator’s helper. Museums often debate titles themselves. “The title is your initial marketing hook,” says David Rubin, curator of contemporary art at the San Antonio Museum of Art. “I’ve worked outside New York most of my career, in areas where art is not necessarily part of the daily diet, so if it’s too esoteric people won’t have a clue what the show is about.” Rubin tends to follow the formula of the two-part title: “a cliché everybody knows or a sexy hook,” followed by a colon and a fuller explication.”, A title such as “New Works”, may mean you need to produce everything new in a year.  A better descriptive title should entice viewers, with the type of work, (painting, mixed media, drawings) and the style (landscapes, contemporary, figurative, historical) and a bit of you, the artist, so they will get your personality. "

Plan the details of your project.,
Produce a scaled down version of your finished mural.,
Prepare the wall or other surface to be painted.,
Measure the location of specific features for your mural after you have primed the surface to receive your choice of paint.,
Paint in the base coat of the background, again, if your subject is a landscape, painting the sky a pale blue (for a daylight sky, of course), the foreground grey, brown, or green, depending on the type of landscape you intend to portray.

,
Allow the background and base coats to dry, then begin marking, using your scaled sketch, the location of key elements of objects located in the foreground.,
Work from the back of your picture to the front, covering large areas in single colors as you go, being careful to keep clean transition edges from one color (an element of your subject) to the next, but keeping in mind that mistakes can be touched up later.,
Paint in details with brushes of suitable size for the portion of work you are painting.,
Cleanup your work with the original paints.,
Overcoat your entire project with a clear sealer if it is intended to last a long time on a surface that will require cleaning.

",How to Paint a Mural," Some of the most important details are these:



Location. Painting a mural requires a suitable location, with a surface that can be painted. Flat, smooth surfaces are ideal, but with planning, even rough-textured or round surfaces can be used for your project.

Type of paint. For exterior projects that are expected to last for years, using an oil based alkyd enamel or polyurethane enamel, or newer 100% acrylic exterior paints may be your best bet. For interior walls, latex paints may offer easier cleanup, lower costs, and less odor, but regardless of your choice, make sure the paint you use is available in colors which are suitable for your project.

Quantity of paint. Because a mural can be dozens of feet long, and even dozens of feet tall, large amounts of paint will be required. By measuring the total area to be covered, the total amount of paint can be calculated, but since mural painting can require many different colors, figuring the actual area to be painted each color is necessary to allow purchasing the right amount of each one.

Method of paint application. Large areas like backgrounds may be rolled or sprayed with a paint sprayer, where details may be added with brushes or an airbrush.

Protection from the elements. Paints are sensitive to direct sunlight, extreme temperatures, and humidity, so planning to deal with these factors before beginning will make your job easier. Obviously, interior projects don't have as many complications as exterior ones, but in public places, keeping the project protected may still require attention. You can consider using varnish for your mural.

Design. Begin your project with a design you choose, either a photograph or sketches, to give you a sense of proportion and ideas for the color scheme you will use. Landscape scenes are greatly different from still life or portraits, and each will have unique requirements and elements.;
, Use a photograph (or pasted photographs) or accurate sketches of your subject, and measure at scale the distances and locations of various points of your subject. An example would be the horizon in a landscape, possibly being located at the one-third point of the total area to be covered. Measuring key features will allow you to calculate the amount of paint when each feature is identified by its color.

, If the surface is low enough the whole mural can be painted standing on the ground or from a stepladder, you are ready to begin cleaning and priming it, but for higher work, you may have to build a scaffold or rent an aerial lift.

, On a landscape (or seascape), you will want to mark the horizon line, since this is the place sky will become land, a distinctive change of background colors.

,, Depending on the complexity of your choice of subject, you may want to actually plot enough points to create a connect-the-dots effect, or if you are confident in your artistic ability, you may choose to sketch all of the details in freehand.

, Blocking out the largest areas of color first allows you to apply the paint with the most efficient method, whether you choose a paint roller or a sprayer. Always allow each color to dry before proceeding to the next adjacent color unless you need to actually blend the two (or more) to create shading or intermediate hues and tones as part of your design.

, An example would be painting a large tree, using large brushes (or even a roller or sprayer) for the trunk and large limbs, then using small brushes for tiny limbs and twigs, if you choose to work in this detail.

, If you have a drip or run, paint over it with the paint appropriate for that location, sharpen lines if they are blurred between colors, and add highlights or deep shadows if these are desired.

Wears suits in his signature colors: purple and green.,
Wear small pops of other colors, usually brown.,
Get green hair.,
Use a knife as the weapon of choice.,
The Joker's makeup may be one of the most important features of his costume.,
Both Jokers appear to have yellowed teeth.",How to Make a Joker Costume," Though suits in these colors aren't common, they are more readily available in party supply stores such as Party City and online. If a trip to your local Party City is not a success, try amazon.com or a similar site. (Look under Men's Clothing and Accessories in the subcategory ""Suits and Sport Coats."" From there you can choose specific colors, such as green or purple) In most cases; his shirt, suit jacket, gloves, and trousers are purple and his waistcoat and sometimes his tie are green.;
, The Joker's tie is brown (and sometimes an olive green), as are his shoes. Any brown tie and dress shoes will suffice for your representation, though if you're striving for perfection, consider looking through pictures from the movie or watching the movie with a watchful eye for wardrobe.

, This is a simple effect to produce. During the Halloween season, Walmart carries an assortment of aerosol hair-dyes that wash out in various colors, including green. They usually cost between $3.00 and $7.00 a can.

, The Joker carries a knife to torture his victims and supplies a different backstory each time he is witnessed holding the knife to someone's face. It is frowned upon to carry a knife around; however, there are multiple toy-weapons available at Party City and online. Mock weapons are also sold as children's toys in stores.

, The face paint, or ""war paint"" as it is called in ""The Dark Knight"", not only hides The Joker's true identity but enforces the image that Gotham's citizens have of him. Replications of his makeup are simple to create. First, appropriate the following: White face paint; black face paint, eyeshadow, or liquid eyeliner; and red face paint or lipstick. Coat your face from the top of your forehead to your chin in white face paint, also coating your ears. To follow Heath Ledger's Joker costume, smudge black face paint, liquid eyeliner, or eyeshadow heavily over your eyelids. There is no need for strict lines or boundaries; as long as your eyelids are coated and the edges look hazy, it'll work. For the lips, cover your lips in red lipstick and either run the red lipstick in a thick, vague line about an inch and a half past both corners of your mouth. The line should curve like the joker's demonic grin and blend a little bit into the white. To achieve the look, draw the lines on your cheeks and smudge them lightly with your fingers. Conversely, if you wish to look more like Jack Nicholson's Joker, lightly line your eyes with black liquid eyeliner. Don't get any in your waterline, keep the liner in a very thin line on the outside of your eyelid. Next, cover the area of your lips in red lipstick and very carefully extend the lines outward to recreate the shape of his very thin lips. Don't just draw thin lines, but extend the shape of your lips to make it seem like the corners are further apart and your lips are thinner. If you already have naturally very thin lips, this look is easier, and you only have to extend the corners of your mouth a slight bit with the red lipstick.

, You'll find that, when applying the white face paint, your teeth naturally look more yellow when compared to the bright white.

Purchase or gather supplies.,
Paint the edges of the canvas panel, if desired.Your print, once mounted, will cover only the front surface of the canvas panel.,
Coat the front of the canvas in Mod Podge.Using a foam brush, paint a thick coat of Mod Podge (or whatever medium you are using) on the front of the canvas panel.,
Place the print on the front of the canvas panel.While the Mod Podge or other medium is still wet, carefully lay the photo/print on the front of the canvas panel, image side up.,
Press the print down.When you are sure that the print is lined up on the canvas panel the way you want it, press down firmly so that it sticks to the Mod Podge or medium underneath.,
Coat the print in Mod Podge.Using a foam brush, coat the front of the photo or print in a light coat of Mod Podge (or whatever medium you are using), using long, even strokes.,
Add texture, if you want.While the Mod Podge or medium you coated the print in is still wet, lay a piece of scrap canvas fabric on top of it.,
Hang the print once it is finished.When all of the paint and Mod Podge/medium is dry, your print is ready to hang.",How to Make Your Own Canvas Prints1," The supplies you need to mount a photo or other print to a canvas panel are readily available from hobby or craft stores, as well as many department stores. For this project, you will need:The photo or other print you would like to mount (printed on regular photo paper)
A pre-made blank canvas panel the same size as the print you would like to mount (if you use a canvas panel that is smaller than the print, you will have to cut the print to size, or wrap and glue/staple its edges to the sides of the panel)Gel medium or decoupage glue such as Mod Podge
Foam brushes or rollers
Acrylic paint (optional, to be used if you want to paint the sides of the canvas panel)
A scrap of canvas fabric, if you want to add texture to your print.;
, Many pre-made canvas panels are mounted on wood frames so that there is a small side (about 0.5 inches thick) on all sides. You can leave these sides unpainted canvas (usually white), or use quick-drying acrylic paint to make them any color you like.


For a classic look, choose a dark color of paint, such as black or brown.
You can also paint the sides in a color that matches or complements a color in the print you are mounting.
Once you have chosen a color, simply use a foam brush to paint the sides of the canvas panel. Let the panel dry before moving on to the next step.
You can add an additional layer of Mod Podge over the acrylic paint if you want extra shine.

, Work quickly so that the medium does not dry, but make sure the entire front of the panel is coated, all the way to the edges.


You can use regular white glue or white wood glue instead of Mod Podge or gel medium.However, you may have to work more quickly, since glue tends to dry faster.

, Make sure that the print lines up exactly with the edges of the front of the canvas panel (they should be the same size).


Alternatively, you can lay the photo down on a hard surface (image side down), then lay the canvas panel on top of it.If you mess up when laying the print down (such as by not lining it up correctly with the canvas), you may be able to remove it if the medium is still wet, and try again.
If your print is larger than your canvas panel, wrap its edges over the sides of the panel and glue or staple them down.

, Make sure that all areas of the print are pressed down. If there are any air bubbles trapped between the print and canvas, gently push them to the edge of the panel and press the canvas down again.


Once the print is fastened to the canvas panel, you can flip it over, set it on a hard surface, and press down on the back of the panel to make sure that the print sticks well., It might look like you are covering up the print, but remember that the Mod Podge or medium will dry clear.

, Press down gently, and then quickly pull it away. This will leave behind a simulated canvas texture. If you do not want this texture on your print, just skip this step.


If you don’t have a scrap piece of canvas to use to create texture, you can use a piece of another kind of cloth, or roll a foam roller over the Mod Podge/medium for a similar effect., Most canvas panels have a “lip” or overhand that makes them easy to hang on a wall using a nail, wire, or other common methods.

Represent yourself online.,
Seek representation.,
Exhibit your work yourself.,
Work with other artists.",How to Make a Living As an Artist1," To attract an agent or other clients, make a website and build a social media presence. You need to be easily located and well represented online.Make a professional-looking website that showcases your work. Your website should include examples of your work, your artist CV, and a list of events (gallery shows, performances, etc) that you have participated in.


If you are a performer, include headshots.
If you are a visual artist, you should have online portfolios of your work.
Consider getting a Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, Facebook page, or other form of social media. Post examples of your work and updates on your progress. This can be a great way to connect with other artists, as well as with talent agents.;
, Whether you are a musician, a writer, an actor, or a painter, you can benefit from the help of a professional who represents talent. Read your contract carefully, however, especially if you are a musician. You should retain the rights to your own work.


. Look up agents who represent other artists you admire and ask for an interview. If you get an interview, ask how many clients they represent-avoid agents who are overbooked.
Get a gallery to represent you. Visit galleries and talk to the curators. If you like the art they show, they might like your art. Galleries will show your work in exchange for a cut of the profits.
. Send a demo to record labels you like. Consider getting a manager to facilitate this process.

, If you are a visual artist, exhibit your work at art fairs. In some cases you may already need gallery representation to do this, but in others you can show and sell your work for an entry fee. If you are a performer, put on amateur shows and invite friends and other artists to watch.


If you are a writer, connect with local reading series and ask to be included in a lineup.
If you are a musician, send demos to local music venues and ask them to book you for a show.

, Collaboration is a great way to become known in your community, which can open up doors for you over time. Consider forming or joining an artist's collective, making collaborative work with other artists, putting on a show with a group of artists you admire, or otherwise working to promote (and become known to) your peers.

Coat the panel in Mod Podge.Using a brush, coat the front of your canvas panel with a light coat of Mod Podge or gel medium.,
Hang the print once it is finished.",How to Make Your Own Canvas Prints2," Transferring a photo or other print to canvas doesn’t require many more supplies that simply mounting one on a panel, just a little more time. The supplies you need can be found at hobby, craft, and department stores. You will need:The photo or other print you would like to mount (printed on regular paper using an ink jet printer)
A pre-made blank canvas panel the same size as the print you would like to mount (if you use a canvas panel that is smaller than the print, you will have to cut the print to size, or wrap and glue/staple its edges to the sides of the panel)Gel medium or decoupage glue such as Mod Podge
Foam brushes or rollers, or a paint brush
A sponge or spray bottle filled with water

, This will allow you to transfer the image onto the canvas by removing the excess paper. This process will create a reverse image of your print on the canvas, so if there is wording on the image (or if it is very important that the image is not reversed), you should first create and print a reversed image, so that it will transfer correctly to the canvas.


You can create a reverse of an image using most photo and image processing software programs if you have a digital file (including a scanned image) of it.

, Work quickly so that the medium does not dry, but make sure the entire front of the panel is coated, all the way to the edges.

, Make sure that the print is lined up exactly with the edges of the canvas panel.

, If there are any air bubbles, gently smooth them out (it’s fine just to use your hands).

, Your print will be completely attached to the panel, looking like a piece of paper glued to the canvas, but don’t worry—things will come together soon.

, Gently wipe the sponge on the paper print on the canvas panel. As the paper gets wet, it will start to rub off. The image from the print, however, will remain behind on the panel.


If you are using a spray bottle of water, just dampen the paper and rub it off, using your fingers., This will protect the image.

, When the top coat of Mod Podge/medium is dry, you can hang your print. Most canvas panels have a “lip” or overhand that makes them easy to hang on a wall using a nail, wire, or other common methods.

, If your artwork is small and saleable (jewelry, pottery, clothing), you can sell it at arts and craft fairs. Just book a table, set up an attractive display, and set prices on everything.

, If you are studying art and are not sure how you'll make a living, consider honing an art that has commercial applications outside of the fine art world, such as design, photography, or animation.

, If you are a writer, consider directing some of your talents to commercial ends. Writers are valuable to companies looking for grant writers, proofreaders, copywriters, affiliate bloggers, and editors., Many artists support themselves in part by teaching their art. Consider tutoring, working at an after-school or summer program for children, or becoming a full time teacher of dance, visual art, or acting.


If you have a graduate degree, consider working as an adjunct at local colleges.

Hold the instrument out to your right.,
Place your hands correctly.,
Position your mouth for blowing.,
Practice blowing until you get a sound.",How to Play the Fife1," Position the fife so that it is horizontal and extending out to the right of your face. The six holes for fingers should be out to the right, while the one hole on its own goes near your mouth for blowing.;
, Cover the three holes nearest to your mouth with the first three fingers of your left hand. Face the palm of that hand toward you. Cover the other three holes with the first three fingers of your right hand. Face the palm of that hand away from you.Though the index, middle, and ring fingers of each hand will be the only ones covering holes, support the fife with the thumb and pinky fingers of both hands by resting them on the body of the instrument however they are comfortable.
If your instrument is not the conventional 6-hole fife, you may have more holes to cover with your other fingers, but you can still use this basic hand placement.

, Place your bottom lip against the fife right next to the hole for blowing. Tighten your lips and try to blow across the hole rather than down into it.


To get the right angle for your breath, imagine some of the air from your mouth is hitting the inner wall of the fife, and some is going past the blow hole outside the fife.Try blowing out air as if you are whispering the word “too,” with lips tightened together and air pushed out sharply by your tongue.

, Roll the instrument slowly back and forth while blowing to find the right angle to create a sound. Also try changing the angle of your breath and the tightness of your lips to find what makes the best sound.


Practice blowing and holding the fife correctly by doing it in front of a mirror.Don’t worry if it takes a long time to get your fife to make a sound! Keep experimenting with the angle of the fife and your lips until you can get a sound consistently.

Tune the instrument first.,
Try a low C#.,
Try a low D. Play a D note by covering every finger hole and blowing an even, steady breath into the blow hole.,
Follow a fingering chart for the fife.",How to Play the Fife2," Play the same note (you can start with all finger holes open) as another fife player or an electronic or online tuner to get the right pitch. Roll the instrument in toward your mouth if your note is too sharp. Roll it out if it is too flat. Experiment rolling slowly in and out on the same note to hear how it changes in pitch. The pitch doesn’t matter so much if you’re just playing by yourself, but you’ll need to tune anytime you start playing with another fife or instrument.

, Make a C sharp note by simply keeping all of the finger holes open and applying steady breath into the instrument. Roll the fife slightly in or out to see if it sounds sharp or flat compared to another player or a tuner.


Try a middle C# by using the same fingering but blowing harder. Tighten your lips to push a harder stream of air from your mouth. This is generally how to achieve a note in a higher octave.
Remember that these notes are for a standard fife, which has 6 holes and is in a Bb key. Look up notes and tuning for your specific instrument if it is in a different key or style.

, Use this note to tune with another player or a tuner by rolling the fife further in or out from your mouth to change the pitch.


Try to hold your fingers firmly over each hole, closing it completely to prevent air from getting through. Keep this in mind for every note you learn how to play.
Remember that these notes are for a standard fife, which has 6 holes and is in a Bb key. Look up notes and tuning for your specific instrument if it is in a different key or style.

, Learn the proper fingering for nearly any note on the fife with a simple fingering chart. You may want to learn the basics of understanding musical notes, but you don’t have to.


The typical complete fingering chart for a standard fife ranges from a low F (all but the second to last hole covered) to a high B (the first, third, and fifth hole covered).Experiment with playing every note you can. Focus first on playing notes in a low or middle octave because they are easier to achieve when you’re just learning to blow and make a consistent sound.
Some of the more difficult notes require half-closing a hole. You can either tilt your finger slightly so it doesn’t completely cover the hole, or you can “float” your finger above the hole so it doesn’t cover it so closely."

Keep playing on your own.",How to Play the Fife3," Locate sheet music for the fife online or at music stores. Use a fingering chart side by side with the sheet music to remember where to place your fingers for each note.


You may be able to adapt music for another wind instrument—like a flute, piccolo, or panpipe—to play for the fife. Ask music store staff or someone familiar with wind instruments for help with this.

, If you can’t or don’t want to read sheet music, you can also learn new songs simply by listening to them and sounding out the notes on your fife through trial and error, one note at a time.


It will get easier to pick out notes once you have a better understanding of your instrument and practice picking up songs by ear. If you get stuck figuring out a note or section of notes, try moving on to a different part of the song., Take deep breaths and move slowly from note to note when you’re figuring out a song. It helps to stand up rather than sit down to play. Hold your head and shoulders up and your chest open to take big deep breaths.


It can be very difficult and awkward at first to move your fingers from note to note. Be patient. Break the music down into small parts (just a few notes at a time), then repeat the same part over and over until you can move your fingers easily to each note before moving onto the next part.

, Look up a fife and drum corps in your area. Join one of these groups to team up with other fife players and drummers to learn new songs, get valuable input and experience, and play in parades or historical events.

, If you want to find another group to play with, and especially if you’re interested in the rich military history of fife music, talk to war reenactors about playing the fife for their reenactments or other events.

, Continue to play just for yourself and improve by learning more from a teacher, an instructional book, or watching videos and looking up music online.

Put photographs in 3-inch (7.62 cm) white mats for a crisp look.",How to Mat Artwork," Wipe the space down with a damp cloth and then completely dry it. As you’re going to be using your mat board to display your artwork, you don’t want it to get covered in dirt and grime! You’ll also be using your art to make proper measurements, so it’s extra important to have a clean work space.Don’t use cleaning solutions or soap to clean your workspace, as these could damage your materials.;
, This is going to require some math, so break out your calculator. First, you need to decide how wide you’d like the mat border to be. Next, measure the width and length of your artwork. This will give you the size you need to cut out the window (the cut-out that will display the artwork). Add the window and border measurements for the total mat board size.If you’re not showing any border or edges on the side of the artwork, you may want to subtract ¼ inch (0.64 cm) from each side (½ inch or 1.27 cm total for both length and width). This will give you a neat edge underneath your mat board.
Your mat board should match up in size with your backing. Once you’ve got the mat board measured, use these measurements to size out the backing as well.

, Most boards come in standard sizes that will need to be trimmed to fit your artwork. Now that you’ve got your measurements, use a tape measure or ruler and make two light pencil marks in each corner to record them., If you’re going to frame your matted art, both your backing and the mat boards need to be measured to fit into the frame. Use the back of the frame to make sure you’ve got these measurements right. If your backing and mat boards are too big, you may need to trim down the border size.Having a frame before you start matting limits your flexibility on sizing the mat board border, so you may want to wait to pick a frame until after everything’s already matted.

, Remove your artwork from the backing and mat boards and set it to the side. Use a ruler to make straight lines connecting each of the small marks you just made. You should have two rectangles or squares on your mat board and one on your backing., Press the razor down firmly at the top corners of the boards. Pull the razor slowly and steadily towards you, stopping at the bottom corner. Keep the same pressure throughout your cut, and be very careful not to dip out or in from the penciled line.Keeping the line straight is the toughest part of this whole process. It’s also frustrating, because you’ll have to start over if your lines aren’t straight. Use something with a straight edge, such as an old frame or a heavy book, to help you cut.

, You shouldn’t need to use any force to remove the cut out, as this could rip the mat board window. Make the cuts at least twice to allow the cut out to simply fall out of the window. Make sure you’re cutting on the exact same lines each time.You may need to make several cuts to remove the cut out. Do as many as you need to, but take your time. Each repeated cut needs to be on the same line as all the others.

, Place your artwork on the backing and measure the space on each side. You should have the same amount of blank space above and below the artwork, as well as on the left and right sides of the piece. Make small pencil marks in the corners on the backing to record the right spot., It’s a good idea to make sure your centering looks right with the window on top of the artwork. This will give you an idea of what your final, matted piece is going to look like. Take a minute to enjoy it before you get back to work., Now that everything’s centered, it’s time to start attaching all the pieces to one another. Use something heavy, like a sock filled with coins or a heavy glass, to keep your artwork where you want it. Don’t worry too much if it shifts, though, since you’ve made marks to keep track of the centering., Use linen or archival tape to create what’s called a hinge to attach your window to the backing. Put two pieces of tape in vertical lines on each side of the back of the piece, so the sticky side doesn’t touch the backing. Lay two more pieces of tape horizontally across the vertical pieces (sticky-side down) to adhere the artwork to the backing.Linen and archival tape has the adhesive ability of regular tape, but it won’t damage your artwork or mat board. It’ll cost more than normal tape, but regular household tape contains acids and other chemicals that may eventually leak onto your artwork., If you’re using corners, take off the bottom adhesive and place four of them on the backing at each corner of the piece. For see-through mounting strips, use two on each side of the piece, or eight total, and adhere them to the backing. You can then slip the artwork directly under the corners or strips.Photo corners and strips are best for conservation, as they avoid the damage that even linen tape could cause to your piece., Lay down the window and the backing flush against each other, with the window face down. Use one long strip of linen tape to connect the window to the backing. Place the tape so one half is on the back of the window and one half is on the backing. Fold them together like you’re closing a book.It’s best to connect the window and backing at the top of the frame.
You’re now ready to put this matted print into a frame if you’d like a more finished look. You can also attach an adhesive picture hanger to the back of your backing board to hang the matted frame up on the wall by itself.

, Dry mounting (rather than using tape) is a more involved process. If you want a permanent and extremely stable mount and you don’t mind opening your wallet, go for it! You’ll need a tacking iron, dry mounting and release tissues, and a professional heating press.Investing in dry mounting equipment may be a great idea if you know you want to consistently mount lots of artwork or photographs.
This really will be an investment. Dry mount presses cost a few thousand dollars, and tacking irons may cost between $50-$100. The tissues will be less pricey.
Be aware that dry mounting isn’t recommended for older artwork or pieces you’d like to preserve. It’s a permanent, irreversible process, so it’s not the best option for conservation.

, It’s time for math! Pick the size you’d like for the border of your window. Measure your artwork. Add these two numbers together to calculate how large the backing needs to be. Make two pencil marks in the corners to record your measurements., Make sure you’ve got a clean space for this step. Once you’ve put down your artwork, lay a sheet of dry mounting tissue over it. It should cover the artwork completely. You’ll trim off the excess later., Most tacking irons can be plugged in to heat them up, just like normal irons. Once you’ve let your iron get toasty, place it in the center of the face-down artwork and dry mounting tissue. Iron the tissue for a few seconds in a small circle to adhere it to the back of the piece., Use scissors or a paper trimmer to carefully cut off the extra dry mounting tissue. Go slowly. You need neat, straight lines, and you don’t want to cut your artwork by accident.If you have access to a large paper trimmer, this will make cutting the tissue much easier and neater.

, Place the artwork face up on its backing. Use a tape measure to check its placement. You should have the same amount of extra space on the left and right sides, as well as on the top and bottom of the piece. Make pencil marks on the backing to mark the spot., Gently lift up two corners of the piece, one at a time. Take your heated tacking iron and adhere the dry mounting tissue, which should be laying flat on the backing, to the backing. Pull the tacking iron from the center outwards. Adhere two opposite corners., Lift up the press cover and slip your piece inside two pieces of leftover mat board and release paper. Close the press. It should be heated to about 180℉ (82.22℃). Use a stopwatch to keep track of the time.For photographs, resin-based paper should only be heated for about 60-90 seconds, while fiber-based papers should be heated for 2-4 minutes. Fiber-based paper is the material that’s more commonly used to print high-quality pictures., You don’t want the board to warp or bubble during the cooling process. Once you remove it from the press, keep it flat by laying it face down underneath something heavy. The artwork needs to be fully cooled before you remove it from under the weight. Test it by lifting one corner and gently touching your finger to the backing.Use a large coffee-table book or several socks with coins in them if you don’t have a flattening weight specially made for the dry mounting process.
Make sure your workspace is still clean before you lay your artwork face down to cool.

, Archival materials are designed to preserve artwork by using acid-free paper that won’t damage your pieces. This is the stuff that museums use on their collections, so you know it’s high quality. These materials will cost you a little more. However, if you’re matting expensive prints or original artwork, this is the way to go., If you’re matting a print that’s less expensive, you may not be as concerned with damage. Be aware that while it may take years for standard backing and mat boards to affect your prints, it will happen eventually. If you’re matting something that you care about (even if it’s not pricey!), pick the archival-quality materials., To highlight smaller artwork or photographs, set them in wide-bordered mats. This will make the piece look more dramatic. It’ll also draw observers’ attention to the center of the piece.Measuring the border will depend on the size of the piece. Your border should measure as wide as at least 25% of the shortest edge. So if your piece is 8 in. by 12 in. (20.32 cm by 30.48 cm), you’ll need a minimum of 2 inches (5.08 cm) for the border. Go up an inch or two (2.54-5.08 cm) to make this a wider border., Larger artwork generally speaks for itself. It doesn’t need any added flair. It’s especially important to keep elaborate or detailed large pieces in windows with thin borders.Keep your border at the minimum measurement (25% of the shortest edge) for a narrow width.

, Don’t think of white as boring, as white will allow your pieces to shine all on their own. White matting also provides a clean look. White is perfect for original artwork, as it’ll allow observers to focus only on the art itself., If you’d like to add a little more character to your matting without distracting from the artwork, try other neutrals. Grays, beiges, and off-whites can all be great choices. This can allow you to add diversity to your mat boards without overshadowing your pieces., If you do decide to go with other colors, choose carefully. You need colors that complement the artwork, rather than competing with it. Try choosing a color that’s already present in the piece to draw it out a bit.If you have a piece that’s mostly orange, for example, don’t go with a blue mat board.
Avoid mats that are darker or brighter than the artwork. If you really want to add color, put bright or bold colors on the bottom, thinner layer of a double mat., Photographs look especially good in matted frames, and they can give you something beautiful to display on your walls. Try a relatively large border in white to give your photographs a professional appearance."

Obtain a quality quena.,
Lift the quena to your lower lip.,
Blow straight out across the notch.,
Once you are able to do this almost instantly, start covering different holes, producing different notes.,
Consult a fingering chart.,
Tune your quena.,
Sit or stand up straight and breathe from the diaphragm.,
Purchase CDs of renown Andean groups and listen to them often.",How to Play the Andean Quena or Kena," This is most easily done through the internet on sites like eBay or Bolivia Mall.


It is also possible to build your own for a few dollars and a couple hours.Although homemade flutes will be the most rewarding to play, they may be difficult to make or to play in tune.;
, The u-notch should rest on the upper segment of your lower lip.

, Tilt the angle of the u-notch up and down until it makes a whistling noise. Your teeth will be slightly parted, and the opening between your lips will be wider than it is tall.


Did you ever make a sound by blowing across the top of a bottle? This is the same sort of thing, except you're blowing across the top of the quena.
Help start each note by making a voiceless ""t"" sound. This is called tonguing. Don't use your voice, but make sure you are saying ""too"" instead of ""who"" into the quena.

, Your left thumb should go on the bottom hole, your left pointer on the first, left middle on the second, left ring on the third, right pointer on the fourth, right middle on the fifth, and right ring on the sixth.


Your right thumb should support the instrument. Your pinkies can go where they feel most comfortable.

Quena fingerings are sometimes imprecise, and may include half-covering a hole.

, Unlike more advanced wind instruments, the quena does not have any moving parts to slide in or out to adjust the pitch, so if you are playing with other musicians, you will have to adjust using technique. You can also use these techniques if you want to bend the pitch.


Blow harder to raise the pitch (make it sharper), less hard to lower the pitch (make it flatter). The amount of breath you supply also will affect how loudly you play.
Tighten your embouchure (the shape of your lips) to bring the pitch up; loosen it to bring the pitch down.
Tilt the quena down (away from your mouth) to raise the pitch; tilt it up (toward your mouth) to lower it.
Raise the pitch even further by opening the bottom-most hole that is covered in any given fingering. Lower the pitch, on notes with many open holes, by covering a hole further down, or by partially covering the next lower hole.

, As with singing, the tone on the quena will benefit if you support your breath this way.

, Get the spirit of Andean music inside you, and figure out how to play it on your quena.

Know the terms.,
Know how your flute's size affects its tune.,
Understand the two ways to change a flute's tune.,
Know your flute's pitch.,
Measure where the cork is currently.,
Understand what the measurement means.,
Adjust a cork that is not centered.,
Leave the cork in place.,
Adjust your headjoint every time you play.Unlike the cork, which you adjust once and leave alone, the headjoint should be adjusted every time you play to get the best sound.The length of a flute's headjoint can range from three to fifteen millimeters for optimal pitch; it will vary every time you play depending on factors such as the temperature in the room and the pitch of other instruments that you might be accompanying.,
Sharpen your pitch.,
Flatten your pitch.",How to Tune a Flute," A flute that is out of tune might be ""flat"" or ""sharp."" Knowing if your flute is flat, very flat, sharp, or very sharp will determine how you get it back into tune.


""Flat"" refers to a pitch that is slightly lower than it is supposed to be. Typically, if your flute is playing flat, it is playing a half-step lower than it should (for example, when you try to play B, you are playing B flat instead). If you're ""very flat,"" you might be a whole step lower than where you should be playing instead.
""Sharp"" means that your pitch is slightly higher than it is supposed to be. If you're playing sharp, it usually means that you are a half-step higher than you should be; if you're very sharp, you might be a whole step higher.;
, When it comes to flutes, the length of the body of the instrument is what determines whether it plays a higher or lower pitch.The longer your flute, the lower its tune. As you lengthen a flute's body, you decrease its pitch. Over-lengthening a flute can cause it to play flat.The shorter your flute, the higher its tune. As you shorten a flute's body, such as a piccolo, you increase its pitch. Over-shortening a flute can cause it to play sharp., A flute is a pretty simple instrument, so tuning it is much simpler than, for example, stringed instruments like a guitar or piano. There are two ways you can tune it: by adjusting the cork located in the crown, or by lengthening the headjoint.The flute's crown is the cap located on the end of the flute nearest the mouthpiece (which is also known as the embouchure hole). The crown looks like a small metal cap, but it is actually attached to a cork that is inside the headjoint.Once you adjust it once, leave it in place. Don't tighten or loosen it again.
The headjoint is the first of three joints that holds the flute's body together. It is located nearest the embouchure hole., Different types of flutes are designed to be played at different pitches; for example, a piccolo plays a very high pitch, while a bass flute plays a low pitch.


Generally, professional flutes are meant to be played at A=442. If you are not sure what pitch your flute is meant to be played at, contact the manufacturer and ask. They can tell you the proper pitch so that you can recognize when your flute is out of pitch.Using a chromatic tuner, play a mid-range note (such as G) without looking at the tuner. Once you have the note established, glance at the tuner to be sure it is not playing flat or sharp.If it is playing flat or sharp, you need to tune your instrument.

, The cork attached to the crown is intended to be set at a particular place, exactly 17.3 millimeters away from the middle of the embouchure hole. If it's not in place, the flute will play sharp or flat. Don't worry; you don't have to measure it yourself! Your flute's cleaning rod has a handy measuring line on it to let you know that the cork is in place.


Insert the marked end of the cleaning rod into the end of the flute opposite the crown, and push it all the way through the flute until it gently touches the cork at the other end. You should be able to see a mark on the cleaning rod through the embouchure hole.

, The placement of the tick-mark on the cleaning rod when you insert in into the flute tells you whether the cork's location is responsible for your flute playing flat or sharp.


If the tick-mark on the cleaning rod is in the exact center of the embouchure hole, then your cork placement is not the problem and you do not need to adjust your crown. Skip on to the next step below titled ""Tuning Your Flute By Pulling Out the Headjoint.""
If your tick mark is too far to the right (that is, in the direction of the crown), your flute tube has too much internal length and is playing flat. If the tick mark is too far to the left, the cork is screwed in too far, decreasing the internal length of the flute tube and causing it to play sharp.

, If your cork is not centered, your flute needs to be tuned by adjusting the cork into the correct position. Be aware that this is a difficult and delicate procedure and if it is not done correctly, it can damage your flute. Ask your music teacher or instrument repair shop to adjust it for you if you are not absolutely sure you can do it correctly.Always measure the placement of the cork before adjusting, to be sure that you know whether you need to lengthen the flute tube or shorten it.To shorten a flute tube and fix a flute that is playing flat, turn the crown counterclockwise one half turn. Very gently push the crown toward the tube, which moves the cork away from the crown and shortens the flute tube. Only push until the crown sits against the headjoint, and do not continue pushing if you meet any resistance.To lengthen a flute tube and fix a flute that is playing sharp, turn the crown clockwise one half turn. Turning the crown clockwise moves the cork, so do not pull on the crown. Check the pitch with a tuner to ensure that you have turned the crown far enough; if you are still playing sharp, turn the crown another half turn.

, Once you have made the proper adjustments to your cork, don't mess with it. It should stay in place until it is serviced by a instrument repair person.


Twisting the crown tightens and loosens the cork unnecessarily and can damage your flute, not to mention altering its tune.,, If you are playing flat, you need to sharpen your pitch by pushing in the headjoint and shortening the flute tube.


Holding the body of the flute firmly in one hand, carefully but firmly push in the headjoint as much as necessary. You might have to use a slight twisting motion to push it in. Start by just pushing it in a bit and then check the tune before pushing it in further.
Use your chromatic tuner to check that you are now playing in the correct pitch. If you are still flat, push it in a bit more.

, If you are playing sharp, you need to flatten your pitch by pulling out your headjoint and lengthening the flute tube.


Holding the body of the flute firmly in one hand, carefully but firmly pull the headjoint out a bit. You might have to use a slight twisting motion to pull it, but don't pull too hard. Start by just pulling it out a few millimeters and then check the tune before pulling any further.
Use your chromatic tuner to check that you are now playing in the correct pitch. If you are still sharp, pull it in a bit more.

Draw a nose.,
Highlight your eyes.,
Swipe a little lip gloss on.",How to Make a Minnie Mouse Costume," You will need one piece of black felt that can be wrapped around a headband, two foam circles, and two pieces of black felt that look like dumbbells. For headbands that are 1/4-inch (6.35-mm) wide, cut out a strip of black felt at least 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) wide. The length should be about 2 inches (5 cm) longer than the length of the headband, which can be measured using a tape measure.






The foam circles should be 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) in diameter. Trace the circle out using a compass, cookie cutter, or other round stencil. Use thick craft foam, and double the foam if you need to create something sturdier.






The black felt dumbbells need to have circles that are 2 inches (5 cm) longer in diameter than the foam circles. In between the circles should be a connecting rectangle about 1 inch (2.5 cm) long, or four times as long as the thickness of the headband.





;
, Use hot glue to attach the felt to the headband as you work, starting from the inside and working your way around.


Place a thin line of hot glue along the inside of the headband. Press your felt onto this glue line, leaving roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) of felt hanging off the end of the headband. Attach the felt at the edge, rather than at the middle.
You may need to apply the glue in 2-inch (5-cm) lines to prevent it from cooling off before you reach the end.
Once one end of the felt is in place, draw a line of hot glue over the inside of the headband, on top of the attached felt. Wrap the remaining felt around the top of the headband and back down. Press the other edge into the new line of glue.
Put a dot of hot glue on the inside of the headband at both ends. Pinch and fold the hanging felt into the dot of glue to close them.
If the felt still wants to open at the end, apply a small dot of hot glue to the inside of the opening and pinch closed.

, Position the foam circle near the center of the circular portion of the dumbbell. Secure it in place with a drizzle of hot glue.


Repeat this step with the other foam circle and the other felt dumbbell.
The foam circle should not extend down into the rectangular portion of the felt dumbbell. It should ideally be located in the center of the circular portion, but if necessary, you can push it a little out from the center and toward the end to keep it from hanging over into the rectangular portion.

, Hold the ears behind the headband with the foam-side facing up. Adjust the distance between the ears until you are satisfied with the appearance.


Usually, the ears should be spaced about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) apart from one another. The ears should also be an equal distance apart from the center.

, Put a small line of hot glue underneath the headband at the spot where the felt meets the headband. Press the headband into the glue to secure it in place.

, Apply a thin drizzle of glue over the foam circle, around the edges of the felt circle, and over the connecting rectangle. Fold the top half of the ear over the headband and onto the bottom half, covering the foam circle completely.


Press the edges firmly to seal them.
If the edges are uneven, you can trim them carefully with a pair of scissors.

, One ribbon should be 1.5-inch (3.8-cm) wide and the other should be 3/8-inch (1 cm) wide. The wider ribbon needs to be 9 inches (23 cm) long and the thinner ribbon should be 2.25 inches (6.35 cm) long.


For a classic Minnie Mouse look, use a red-and-white polka dot ribbon for the larger piece and a plain red ribbon for smaller piece.
Other looks that Minnie has sported include pink-and-white polka dot bows and plain pink bows. Choose the ribbon color and pattern that will best match the rest of your Minnie Mouse costume.

, Fold the ends of the wider ribbon over each other so that they overlap, creating a loop. Glue the ends in place with a small dot of hot glue.


Make sure that the polka dot side faces out.

, Fold the loop in half, flattening it. Hold the loop so that the sides of the ribbon are between your thumb and forefinger and press down in the middle.


If desired, you could add a dot of glue to the inside middle of the loop before folding it in half. Do not glue across the entire inside, however.
You can also secure the bow in place by applying a small dot of hot glue to the outside center of the bow when you pinch it into shape.

, Wrap the smaller strip of ribbon around the bow and the headband to hold the bow in place.

Glue the end of the smaller ribbon to the inside of the headband. It should be position in the exact center of the headband, in between the two ears.






Place the bow in front of the headband.






Wrap the smaller ribbon around the top of the headband and over the bow. Glue the loose end down, placing a dot of glue on the original attached end on the inside of the headband.







, The iconic Minnie Mouse dress is covered in a red-and-white polka dot pattern. The dress should have a circle skirt or other full skirt that extends down to the knee. It also has puffy short sleeves.If you cannot find a dress that matches this description and are unable to sew one yourself, improvise. The key features are the red polka dots and the full skirt. Any red polka dot dress with a fairly conservative neckline and hemline will do the trick. You can even use separates, if necessary, as long as either the blouse or skirt has red polka dots.
If you are unsatisfied with the amount of fullness offered by your skirt, you might be able to wear a tulle petticoat beneath it to add volume. This only works if the skirt flairs out, rather than clinging to your figure.
You could try mimicking one of Minnie's other looks if red polka dots aren't your thing. Minnie Mouse has been known to wear pink-and-white polka dots and yellow-and-white polka dots. She's also worn a solid blue dress with a pink bow.

,


If the weather is too warm for tights, you can also keep your legs bare.
Similarly, if the weather is extremely cold, you can slip a long-sleeve black shirt on beneath your dress.

, Minnie Mouse traditionally wears yellow heels with her red polka dot dress. Look for a short heel that has a closed toe.


With any other outfit, Minnie usually wears pink heels instead of yellow ones.
If you cannot find yellow or pink heels, you can wear solid black or white ones, instead.
If heels do not suit you, swap them for cute, Girly flats, instead.

, The gloves should be wrist-length.

, Use black face paint or a black eyebrow pencil to color the tip of your nose black.


Do not color the bridge of your nose. You only need to color in the tip of your nose to mimic Minnie.
Whiskers are not necessary. Most pictures of Minnie Mouse do not show whiskers, so you do not need to make them part of your costume, either.

, Minnie Mouse has long eyelashes, so you should bring attention to your eyelashes by using black mascara or an eyelash curler.


Alternatively, you could use fake eyelashes if your own eyelashes are too thin.
If you want to draw further attention to your eyes, apply a light coating of gray eyeshadow over the lid and trace your upper lid with black eyeliner. While defining your eyes is a good idea for this look, less make-up is actually more suitable for the costume than more.

, Apply a pink or red lip gloss to your lips. Choose whichever color best matches with your dress and bow.


As with eye make-up, less is more. Lip glosses tend to look more accurate than lipsticks since lipsticks can be somewhat heavy.

Determine your purpose.,
Choose your color.,
Create a designated case for your kazoo.,
Hold the kazoo horizontally.,
Hum into the kazoo.,
Create pitch with your humming.,
Train your ear.,
Set aside time to practice each day.,
Play with friends.",How to Play the Kazoo," Do you want to play for fun, for a class, or as a whimsical addition to your band? This will help determine the quality of kazoo that you need.


For the most part, the kazoo is a very inexpensive instrument. You can find plastic kazoos at dollar stores, department stores, and toy stores.
If you’re looking for something of a slightly higher quality or different aesthetic, consider a wooden kazoo.You also might consider a metal kazoo.If you do choose metal, watch for rust, and dry it off each time you play.
If you’re going to be playing a lot, consider getting a few kazoos, since they are often only a couple of dollars each. This will ensure you have a back up in case one breaks.
An electric kazoo is another alternative for musicians and those interested in recording with the kazoo.;
, The kazoo is a whimsical instrument that comes in a rainbow array of colors to match.


Pick a fun color that makes you excited to pick up your kazoo and play.Add personalization. Consider putting a small sticker on your kazoo. This is especially great for identification if you’ll be using it in a classroom setting, where a lot of people with have their kazoos with them.

, Even though the kazoo is a relatively inexpensive instrument, you still want to take care of it.


If the kazoo doesn’t come with a case, use an old, hard shell eyeglass case. You can find these at thrift stores, if you don’t have one already.
Write your name on your case in permanent marker.

, Unlike a larger instrument such as a clarinet, you can use one hand to hold your kazoo.


The mouthpiece of the kazoo is the wider, flattened end.

, To make sounds with your kazoo, you’ll need to hum, rather than blowbecause humming create vibration.You should place your mouth on the kazoo as though it were a whistle.
To make slightly different types of sounds, try humming different syllables like “do,” “who,” “brr,” or “rrr.”

, The kazoo has no frills so you create all of the pitches in a song with your mouth.


Practice humming songs you like without the kazoo, first.
Then, try humming them with your kazoo’s mouthpiece against your mouth.

, Because all the pitch in your kazoo playing comes from your mouth alone, you’ll want to practice hearing and recreating notes.Listen to songs you like, and sing along out loud. Pay attention to trying to match the pitch correctly.
Record yourself humming a song on a recorder device or your phone. Then, play the song and your recording at the same time. See how well you matched pitch.
Try playing your kazoo along to recorded songs.

, Even though the kazoo is a simple instrument, you won’t improve unless you practice.


Pick a specific time of day and length of time you want to practice.
Set some goals for each practice session.Write them down in a notebook. Your goals could be experimenting with humming techniques or practicing specific songs.

, Above all, the kazoo is a fun instrument, and you should enjoy playing it.


Play your favorite songs for your friends.
If you’re in a class, practice with other people from your class.
If some of your friends play different instruments, consider starting a band for fun.

Choose a harmonica.,
Learn about your harmonica.,
Learn to read harmonica tablature.",How to Play a Harmonica1," There are many different types of harmonica available for purchase, which vary in use and price. For now, purchase either a diatonic or a chromatic harmonica. Either type can be used to play most popular music, such as blues or folk.









The diatonic harmonica is arguably the most common type available, and certainly the cheapest. It's tuned to a specific key, which can't be changed. Most diatonic harmonicas are tuned to the key of C. Types of diatonic harmonica include the “blues harmonica,” the “tremolo harmonica,” and the “octave harmonica.”

In the western world, the blues harmonica is common; in east Asia, the tremolo harmonica is seen more often.


The chromatic harmonica is a type of harmonica that uses a mechanical apparatus to control which holes make noise. Basic chromatic harmonicas with 10 notes can only play one full key (the same as a diatonic harmonica), but chromatics with 12-16 holes can be tuned to any key. Chromatics are considerably more expensive than most diatonic harmonicas; a quality chromatic from a reputable brand can cost several hundred dollars.

Because of their flexibility, 12-plus-note chromatic harmonicas are generally preferred for jazz music.


A common shorthand term for the harmonica is the “harp.” This comes from its other traditional names, including “French harp” and “blues harp.” As long as the context is clear, the words “harmonica” and “harp” can be used interchangeably.;
, The harmonica is a reed instrument that uses brass reeds. The reeds are what split the air you push or pull through the holes to create tones. Reeds are mounted on a plate, sensibly called the reed plate, which is also usually made of brass. The part of the harmonica that the reed plate is mounted to is called the comb, and is typically made of plastic or metal. The mouthpiece of the harp may be integrated into the comb, or in chromatic harmonicas, screwed on separately. The cover plates cover the rest of the apparatus, and can be made of wood, metal, or plastic.









A chromatic harp's sliding bar is also usually made of metal.
Depending on whether you inhale or exhale through your harp, different notes are produced by the reeds. A typical diatonic harp tuned to C on the exhale is tuned to G on the inhale. These scales complement each other nicely, each filling in the other without having to add extra holes.
The reeds inside your harmonica are delicate and will wear out over time. Gentle playing and regular care are required to maintain a good tone as long as possible.

, Like guitars, harmonicas can be played by following tablature, which reduces the notes on a sheet of music down to an easy-to-follow system of holes and breath patterns. Tablature is useful for larger chromatic harmonicas as well, but it differs somewhat from diatonic tablature, and is less common.









Breathing is marked by arrows. An up arrow indicates a breath out; a down arrow indicates a breath in.

Most holes on a diatonic harmonica produce two “neighbor” notes on a given scale; thus playing C and then D on the same scale is accomplished by blowing into the appropriate hole, and then drawing in from the same hole.


Holes are marked with a number, starting from the lowest (left-hand) tone and moving upward. Thus, the lowest two notes are (up) 1 and (down) 1. On a 10-hole harp, the highest note would be (down) 10.

Some notes on a regular 10-hole harmonica overlap, notably (down) 2 and (up) 3. This is necessary to allow proper range for playing scales.


More advanced techniques are marked with slashes or another small mark. Diagonal slashes through the arrows indicate that note bending (covered later) is required to get the proper tone. Chevrons or slashes on chromatic tablature can also indicate whether or not to hold the button in.

There isn't a standardized system of tablature that's used by all harmonica players. However, once you practice and get comfortable reading one type, most other types will make sense to you quickly.

Make a note by blowing.,
Draw in a breath to change notes.,
Try playing a scale.,
Practice.",How to Play a Harmonica2," The very first thing to practice with your new instrument is making a note. Pick a hole or a set of holes on the mouthpiece and blow gently into them. Neighboring holes are typically designed to harmonize with each other automatically, so try blowing into three holes at once to make a pleasing sound. Practice switching between only playing one hole, and playing chords on multiple holes.









This type of playing is called “straight-harp” or “first position.”
As you might suspect, the number of holes you blow through is partly controlled by your lips. To allow greater control over the notes you play, you'll eventually learn to use the blade of your tongue to block holes as well. This is covered later.

, Remembering to pull air across the reeds gently, breathe in to bring each note up a step. By breathing in and out through the mouthpiece, you can gain access to all the notes your harp is tuned for.









This type of playing is called “cross-harp” or “second position.” Cross-harp notes are often well-suited to blues riffs.
If you have a chromatic harmonica, practice pushing and holding the slide button to further control the notes you produce.

, On a C-tuned diatonic harmonica, the C scale starts with (up) 4 and climbs to (up) 7. The standard out, in pattern is repeated except for on the 7th hole, where it is switched (draw in first, then out). This scale is the only complete scale on a C-tuned harp, but you can sometimes play songs on other scales, provided they don't require the missing note(s) of the scale.








, Keep practicing playing scales and individual notes until you're comfortable with playing just one note at a time. Once you can exert that level of control over your instrument, pick out some simple songs and practice them as well. Tablature for songs like “Mary Had a Little Lamb” and “Oh, Susanna” is easy to find online, if you get stuck.









Try adding texture by playing multiple notes at once. The next step in your practice is to slightly relax your control and add two-note and three-note chords to the songs you practice by playing two or three adjacent holes at once. This will help you develop more control over your mouth and your breathing, and make the songs more interesting to listen to.

Don't play everything in chords! Try adding a chord at the end of a verse or phrase. The important thing is to get comfortable switching between single notes and multiple notes.



"
"
Pay for lessons.,
Skip holes.,
Play with two hands cupped.,
Learn to tongue block.,
Begin to learn note bending.",How to Play a Harmonica3," From this point on, though you can certainly continue to teach yourself, you'll see faster and more technically sound results if you practice under the tutelage of an experienced player. Harmonica lessons vary in price and frequency; feel free to try a few lessons from a teacher and then move on until you find one who fits your needs.









Even as you take lessons, continue to rely on guides and books to help augment your playing. There's no reason to drop all your other material just because you're supplementing it with professional lessons.

, It's easy to fall into a pattern of constantly forcing air in and out through your harp, but as you begin to play more advanced songs, you'll need to practice skipping over some holes to reach others. Play songs with notes that require you to jump a hole or two, such as the American traditional tune, “Shenandoah,” which has a jump from the 4th to the 6th hole near the end of the second phrase (on a standard C diatonic).









Practice skipping by pulling the harmonica slightly away and then returning it to the appropriate position (to further your familiarity with the position of each hole) and by stopping your airflow without removing the harmonica (to give you more practice with breath control).

, To start with, you've probably been holding the harmonica with the pointer finger and thumb of your left (or non-dominant) hand and sliding it as you play. Up your game by adding your right (or dominant) hand. Rest the heel of your right palm under your left thumb, and then lay the blade of your right palm along your left to that your fingers can curl up around your left pinky finger. This creates a “sounding hole” that can be used to affect the sound coming from your harmonica.









Add a soft warble or wail by flapping your sounding hole open and shut. Use it at the end of a verse to add emotion, or just practice it anywhere you like.
Create a train whistle effect by starting with the sounding hole open, then tapping it shut and open again once.
Play a muted, soft sound by leaving the sounding hole mostly closed.
You'll likely find that this position forces you to hold your harp at an angle, with the left end pointed slightly down and inward. This position actually lends itself to other techniques as well, so embrace it.

, Tongue blocking is a great way to roll single notes into beautiful chords without breaking the original note. Using the side (blade) of your tongue, you'll block some notes of a chord, and then lift off partway through the note to add them. This technique takes practice, but your sounding hole position should help present the side of your tongue to the mouthpiece naturally.









Start by opening your mouth to cover the first four holes of your harp. Using your tongue, block holes 1 through 3 and play a straight-position note on hole 4. If you did it right, you should only hear (up) 4 being played. Once you can do this with ease, play a sustained note and then lift your tongue off halfway through to introduce the full harmony.
Tongue blocks can be used to add a waltz- or polka-like airiness to songs by alternating them with individual notes, or in any of a number of other different ways. They're very flexible. Practice using them until you're comfortable improvising them from song to song.

, Probably the most advanced technique in terms of the sheer amount of practice it takes to master is note bending. Note bending is the art of actually changing the notes your harmonica produces by making airflow tighter and sharper. Master harpists can turn a diatonic harmonica into a de facto chromatic harmonica just by note bending. For now, practice using it to produce flat notes to increase your repertoire.









The basic technique for bending a note is to make the opening in your lips very very small, and sharply suck air through them into the hole you want to bend. Draw a cross-harp note and gradually pinch your lips together until you begin to hear the tone change. By pinching your lips more or less, you can further control the tone of the note.
Be very careful when you practice note bending. Because the air crosses the reeds so sharply, it can easily loosen or bend them, ruining your instrument. Patience and care are required to find a happy medium between not bending a note and bending it too harshly.

Shop for your ocarina online.Since it’s such a rare instrument, you’re going to be hard-pressed to find one in a music store.,
Decide on a pitch range.,
Choose an ocarina style that best suits your skill level.A four-hole or six-hole ocarina will be the best style to learn on, as they are generally inexpensive, light, and easily produce a wide range of notes with very few finger patterns.,
Avoid Peruvian and plastic ocarinas.",How to Play the Ocarina1," With a little research, you’ll find a wealth of online retailers who sell what you’re looking for—from Amazon to retailers who specialize in high quality ocarinas.









If you’re just learning how to play this instrument, don’t break the bank on your first ocarina. $20 to $60 should get you the perfect starter instrument.
If you find you love your new hobby and want to invest in an instrument, high quality ocarinas can run as high as $500.;
, Ocarinas don’t cover a wide range of sounds, like a piano does, so it’s important to choose an ocarina that’s going to play the pitch you want. In descending order from highest to lowest pitch range, you can find soprano, alto, tenor, and bass ocarinas.









The higher the range, the smaller the instrument, so keep that in mind when choosing your instrument.

,









A four-hole ocarina can produce a basic scale of eight notes.
A six-hole ocarina can produce a basic scale plus semitones.

, Peruvian ocarinas are beautifully styled and detailed, so you may be tempted to buy one on aesthetics alone. However, they’re usually crafted with cheap materials, and don’t sound very good as a result. They’re more decorative than useful for playing purposes. Plastic ocarinas, although seductively affordable, are often “airy” and improperly tuned.

",How to Make Bassoon Reeds," These are listed below under Things You'll Need.

,  Soaking makes the cane more pliable and will reduce the chances or breaking or cracking when forming the reed.;
,  The top wire should be 1/8 inch below the ridge of the cane (where the shaping starts). The second wire should be 3/8 inch below the ridge. The third wire will be 3/16 inch from the end of the cane (not the ridge).

,  These grooves will give the wire a place to sit for more stability.

, If it cracks a lot, stop and soak for another 1 or more hours.

,,, Wrap so that the ends pass each other on the opposite side of the reed.

, Twist to tighten the wires about 75 percent of the way. Do not twist too much; the wire could snap. However, do not skimp on the twisting, since insecure wiring will not allow the cane to stay together.

, Ensure that the wires are sitting properly in the wire grooves. Remember to squeeze the back of the wires (where they crossed around the reed) so they are completely touching each other. Any gaps can affect the reed's performance.

, Make three or four scores on each side of the cane.

, Be careful when wrapping, since the wires might stab your fingers. Keep the twine evenly bound––this step prevents cracking.

, Slowly push into the reed, twisting as you push. Push it in far enough to reach the third line on the mandrel tip.

, This allows the mandrel to ease in to the reed more. Once the mandrel is completely in place, use the pliers to tighten the wires completely. Again, be sure to not over-twist the wires.

, Place into the mandrel tip holder. Leave the reeds on the tip for at least to completely cure.

, Then remove the twine from the reed. Use the pliers to carefully untwist and remove the wires from the reed.

,, Use the ""scroll"" of sandpaper to sand the groove the mandrel made. Lightly sand the edges to make the sides flat and even. This will allow them to lay flat once folded back together. Do this to both ends of the cane.

,,, However, make sure that you start on the opposite side of the top wire (once twisted, the twist should be opposite the top wire).

,, Once cut, fold the thread in half.

, Keeping tension on the wire, wrap it around the bottom wire, alternating above and below the wire as you wrap.

, Then cross up above the turban and wrap up to the second wire.

, Cut off the excess (although, leave about half an inch/1cm).

,  Place the reed on the mandrel tip holder and allow it to dry for at least a day.

, Use the wire cutter to cut the bottom wire as close to the thread as possible. Bend the other two wires in so they lay flat against the reed.

, Only cut small sections at a time. If too much is cut off, the reed will not be able to play in the desired range.

,,, Hold the reed with your thumb and the knife with your other. Gently and lightly scrape the reed with short strokes, removing small amounts of fiber at a time. Be sure to do this only a little at a time since too much shaving with create many performance issues.

,
After playing, soak the reed for a couple of minutes while disassembling the instrument.",How to Keep Woodwind Reeds Playable," Any small bottle with a tightly sealing cap will work, but it probably must have a screw-cap since the hydrogen peroxide will tend to produce gas (Oxygen -- very small quantities and of no danger) which will pop the lid of snap-cap bottles and leak. You don't want leaks because hydrogen peroxide will bleach and deteriorate most clothing/case linings/etc.;
, The proportions are not critical. Over time, you will lose some liquid -- refill with straight hydrogen peroxide until the liquid gets cloudy; at that point, it is time to start over with new water/hydrogen peroxide.

, If you have previously-played reeds, the first time you put them into the mixture, it will foam a lot. New and/or clean reeds will not foam very much. The foaming is from the removal of the ""gunk"" (food particles, dried saliva, mildew, etc.) that build-up on reeds.

,, For tubular reeds, a reed brush can be helpful for cleaning the inside. Simply wiping off the outsides of the reed with the fingers or with the lips is sufficient for external cleaning.

Check for a user’s manual.,
Label and memorize the holes.,
Learn your basic scales.,
Practice your scales.,
Familiarize yourself with musical notations.",How to Play the Ocarina2," Sometimes, ocarinas come with an instrument chart or other instructions on how to play the instrument. If it did, study the chart to see which holes you have to cover to produce a specific note.









If your ocarina did not come with a user’s manual, follow the instructions in the next step.

, You can produce a wide range of sounds by covering and uncovering different combinations of the four holes with your fingers. As such, you want to make sure that you have a labeling system that helps you remember which combinations produce specific sounds.









Put the ocarina’s mouthpiece in your mouth as though you were going to play it and look at the positioning of the holes from this perspective.
In your mind, label the top left hole “1”, the top right “2”, bottom left “3”, and the bottom right hole “4.”
Drill those hole positions into your head so that you can easily read these instructions for how to play scales.
An “x” will be used to symbolize an open hole, meaning you should not cover that hole with your finger.
So, for example, a Middle C is represented as 1 2 3 4. This means you should cover all four holes with your pointer and middle fingers while blowing through the mouthpiece.
A D, on the other hand, is represented as 1 X 3 4. This means that all holes should be covered except for hole 2 — the top right hole.

, Go through them slowly at first and try to memorize the finger patterns needed to create this progression of notes. Don’t worry about speed yet — just memorize how to play a scale. Use the following finger patterns to work through the scales:









Middle C: 1 2 3 4
D: 1 X 3 4
E: 1 2 3 X
F: 1 X 3 X
F# (Gb): X 2 3 4
G: X X 3 4
G# (Ab): X 2 3 X
A: X X 3 X
A# (Bb): X X X 4
B: X 2 X X
C: XXXX

, The best thing you can do to become a proficient ocarina player is to be able to move up and down your scales. There are two things you want to focus on during this practice: 1) memorizing the notes produced by your finger patterns and 2) speed. The better you get at those two things, the more you’ll be able to enjoy the actual music you’re playing.









A scale of C progresses thusly: C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C.
Practice it going up (ascending) and down (descending). This is the basis for many pieces you will play.

, Everyone knows what musical notes look like, but being able to decode them into an actual song might be beyond your grasp.

, Just like with a four-hole ocarina, the only way you’ll find any success playing this instrument is by memorizing how to produce a specific note. You need a labeling system — but this time, for six holes.









Put the ocarina’s mouthpiece in your mouth as though you were going to play it and look at the positioning of the holes on the top of the instrument from this perspective.
In your mind, label the top left hole “1,” the top right “2,” the bottom left “3,” and the bottom right “4.”
Then imagine the holes on the bottom of the instrument, which can be covered with your thumbs. Label the one on the left “5” and the one on the right “6.”
Drill those hole positions into your head so that you can easily read these instructions for how to play scales.
An “x” will be used to symbolize an open hole, meaning you should not cover that hole with your finger.

, Even though the six-hole ocarina has two extra holes on the back, it uses the same basic system as the four-hole ocarina. The significant difference is that to produce the notes from the four-hole instrument, you must cover the two holes on the bottom while following the same pattern in the top four holes. Memorize this scale progression, beginning slowly again and focusing on familiarizing yourself with the notes. Use the following finger patterns to work through the scales:









Middle C: 1 2 3 4 5 6
D: 1 X 3 4 5 6
E: 1 2 3 X 5 6
F: 1 X 3 X 5 6
F# (Gb): X 2 3 4 5 6
G: X X 3 4 5 6
G# (Ab): X 2 3 X 5 6
A: X X 3 X 5 6
A# (Bb): X X X 4 5 6
B: X 2 X X 5 6
C: XXXX 5 6

, These holes raise the basic notes from the previous step by one step (a semitone) or by two steps (a tone). To raise a note by one step, begin with the fingering for the lower note as on a four-hole instrument, but cover hole 5 covered and leave 6 open. To raise a note by two steps, start again with the fingering for the lower note on a four-hole instrument, with hole 5 open and 6 covered.









A semitone raises a note to the next one up in the chromatic scale, eg: C→C#, Ab→A, E→F.
A tone raises it up two steps in the same scale, eg: C→D, Ab→Bb, E→F#.
For example, to play a C#, you would position holes 1-4 for a C (XXXX), then move up one step by covering hole 5: X X X X 5 X.
To easily move from a C to a D without having to move all of your fingers around, you would begin with a C (XXXX56) then move up two steps by covering hole 6: X X X X X 6.
This is a much easier transition for your fingers than XXXX56 to 1X3456.

, The best thing you can do to become a proficient ocarina player is to be able to move up and down your scales.

Wear your hair down in long waves.",How to Make a Wonder Woman Costume," Wonder Woman's top is traditionally strapless, so if you want to make a more accurate costume, go with a red bustier or red tube top. Look for one in a glossy material, if possible. For a more modest variation, use a red swimsuit or snug red tank top.;
, Gold duct tape should suffice for this. There are several designs you could use for the emblem, which you can find photos of online, and they range from elaborate eagle patterns to simple W shapes. One option is to cut a W-shaped eagle out of craft foam, spray paint it gold, and then glue it to the top.For something very simple, just line the top front edge of your bustier, swimsuit, or tank top with gold tape.
For something a little more daring, create a double-layer W (one W inside another W) with wings or straight horizontal lines coming off the top ends of both W shapes.

, The bottom half of the costume is fairly revealing and usually only covers the upper to mid thigh. High-waisted boy shorts work perfectly, but blue gym shorts can work as well. If you want a more modest option, though, you can wear a blue miniskirt, like Wonder Woman used to wear in the old comics.In some modern revamps of the comic, Wonder Woman is wearing tight blue or black pants, so you could go this route if you’re not comfortable wearing shorts or a skirt.
In the 2017 film, she wears a skirt with strips of fabric hanging down, which also provides more coverage. Create this look by finding strips of scrap leather and painting them blue before sewing or gluing them to the bottom of your bustier., If you’re going for the classic comic look, add stars to the skirt or shorts by cutting them from white fabric, white tape, or white construction paper. Use fabric glue to adhere the stars to the shorts or skirt, applying them generously., It may be difficult to find red boots, so get the boots in any color and spray paint them red. Or use red duct tape or electrical tape to cover the entirety of the boot. You can also just cover regular shoes with knee-high red softball socks., The very top of each boot leg should be lined with white. You also need a white stripe down the center of the boot, extending from the top to the toe., To make a more modest version of the bustier for a child, select a red tank top, t-shirt, or even long-sleeved t-shirt if they’ll be wearing the costume for a chilly night of trick-or-treating., Since the top likely won’t have a deep neckline to use for the emblem, simply use yellow electrical tape or cut strips of gold duct tape to make nested W’s on the front of the shirt. You can also cut the W’s out of gold glitter foam, which can be found at craft stores.If you’re making a last-minute costume and don’t have any tape, use a black Sharpie to draw the design on the shirt. Just remember to place a piece of cardboard or something similar inside the shirt as you draw so that the ink doesn’t bleed through to the back.

, You can opt for short blue shorts if you’re comfortable dressing your child in them, but a skirt will add a bit of length and femininity to the costume. It can be any material, such as cotton, jersey, or denim, or try something fun like a blue tutu., If your child will be trick-or-treating in this costume and you’re concerned about keeping them warm, find some nude-colored tights or panty hose to wear under the skirt. These can be purchased cheaply at most drugstores., Cut stars out of white fabric, felt, or paper, then sew or glue them to the skirt with fabric glue. If you can find stickers shaped like white stars, let your child help you decorate the skirt with the stickers. Depending on the fabric, they may still need to be glued so that they don’t fall off., Unless your child already owns knee-high boots, it will be easier and less expensive to just buy socks that go up to their knees. Pull the socks over a pair of ballet flats or other simple shoes to create a seamless boot-like look., Use white electrical or duct tape to line the center of the sock from knee to toe. Also add a circle of white around the top of the sock. If you don’t have white tape, tear up an old white t-shirt and sew or glue long strips of fabric to the sock., While typical depictions of Wonder Woman costumes don’t include a cape, many child versions of the costume have one. Simply find a long stretch of red fabric and either sew it to the top of the shirt, or safety pin it to both shoulders., If you cannot find a gold belt, you can spray paint any wide belt with gold metallic paint or you can cut a simple sash belt out of gold fabric. You can also trace the design onto gold vinyl and wrap that around your waist, attaching it in the back with velcro.You can leave the belt as a solid band, or you can add a star or the iconic Wonder Woman W to the front. Cut the desired shape out of cardboard or thin foam that has been spray painted red, and attach the shape to the center front of the belt with craft glue or hot glue.

, Unless you already own thick gold bangle bracelets, the easiest way to mimic Wonder Woman's arm bands is with toilet paper rolls. Cut each roll lengthwise so you can slip your wrist in and out, then spray with gold spray paint or cover in gold craft paper. Add a piece of tape if the cuffs are not staying on your wrists.In the absence of any gold craft materials, use tin foil to wrap the toilet paper holders to create a metallic look.

, Wonder Woman has a thick gold tiara with a red star on it. The tiara is worn around the top part of her forehead and, ideally, should have a slight diamond shape in the center front. You can create the tiara by covering a cheap exercise headband or cheap plastic tiara with metallic gold fabric, wrapping paper, or foil.Finish off the tiara with a red star. You can either adhere a red star sticker to the front, or you can cut a small red star out of fabric or red duct tape., For the lasso, you can use a few yards (meters) of plain tan rope. Traditionally, the lasso is yellow in color, so you can also spray paint it yellow or gold if you so desire. As long as it is light in color, though, the rope should work.Tie a simple loop at the end of the rope to mimic the lasso look and hook the rope, wound up, to your belt.

, You can purchase a plastic sword and shield at a party store, costume store, or toy store. Or you can make them yourself by tracing them and cutting them out of cardboard. The shield should be a circle, and you can draw or tape the W emblem on it like you did with the shirt. For the sword, wrap the blade in aluminum foil to give it a more metallic look., Style your hair in loose waves by wrapping sections loosely around a curling iron and releasing them after a few seconds. If you do not have black hair, you could use temporary dye to dye it black. If your hair is not long enough or if you do not want to dye it, you can also buy a wavy black wig from a party store."

, Once you have settled upon the suit and are dead certain that's the one you want to make you can now buy your materials. The suit is first priority but you can learn how to make that by reading How to Make a Spider Man Costume. You can usually pick up the required items from your local craft shop or any other shop that will sell them. Failing that, the other option is to purchase them online., Some eyes are different shapes to others so you need to properly research the suit you are making so as to know what shape you must make. Usually if you type in what you're after (e.g. ""Scarlet Spider Lense Template"") you will get the right designs however if you are unable to, simply search a good image of the chosen suit and either;

resize and then print the image off or
resize and trace straight from the computer onto paper pressing very gently or
sketch the design yourself

, Now you have your template, cut it out and draw around it onto card. Make sure when you cut it out you cut out the inside so you get the border of the lense. Draw around this template twice to make lenses for both eyes., This may be tricky to do depending on the colour, black won't show but some other colours will and white will stand out clearly. Draw around the card template as it's the strongest again twice and cut those out., Once you have cut out the card borders it's time to get gluing. Choose a corner of the fabric to use, apply hot glue to one side of the card border and stick it down onto the fabric. Do the same with the other border but applying glue on the other side and stick it down about 2-3cm away from the other., Flip the fabric over and apply hot glue to the fabric following the card border showing through then stick your foam/felt border onto that., Cut the fabric in squares around the glued lense borders then cut the excess fabric off., Now you have your completed lenses you can now glue them onto the face of your suit."

Style your hair.",How to Make a Thor Costume," The tissue box should be one of the long, full-sized boxes, rather than the smaller, square ones. Peel off the perforated top, but leave the tissues in the box. The tissues will give some weight to your hammer. Then, grab a paper towel roll. You can take the paper towels off an existing roll, or just wait until you have finished off a roll.Note: you should only use tissue boxes that have an opening at the top, rather than an opening over the top and side.;
, Place one of the ends of the paper towel roll into the top of the tissue box (the plastic covered opening). Take some duct tape and wrap it around where the roll meets the box. Wrap enough tape around so that the roll is secured to the box. Feel free to add some pieces of duct tape, laid across perpendicular to the existing tape., Wrap the roll in duct tape in a circular motion, starting from the base to the top of the roll. Leave the opening at the top of the roll free of tape. Duct tape the tissue box as well, using long continuous pieces of tape. The goal is to get the box to look as smooth as possible. Make sure the entire box gets covered in tape.Remember to use silver (or standard gray) duct tape for this part of the project, as the tape on the tissue box will show on the final product.

, Take some tinfoil and break it into small strips. Ball each of the small strips up, and place them down into the opening in the paper towel roll. Every time you get a few in, take the end of a spatula, or a long utensil, and shove it into the roll. Press the tinfoil down so that it is compacted. Remove your utensil, and continue to add more crumpled strips or tinfoil.Do this until the entire roll is filled. Once you are done, take a strip of duct tape and place it over the opening so that the tinfoil does not fall out.

, Purchase a brown piece of construction paper. Lay a thin line of super glue down one of the short ends of the paper. Place that end against the handle, centered, so that there is equal space on both sides. Then wrap the piece of paper around the handle.Once the entire piece is wrapped around, add another small layer of super glue to the short edge of the paper. Press it down against the handle with your hand until it is dry (about 1 minute).

, Go to your nearest arts and crafts store to purchase a large piece of red flannel. The color red should be between pure red and maroon. Use a measuring tape to measure from your neckline to your feet. Also measure from outside one shoulder to the outside of the other shoulder. These two measurements will be the dimensions of your fabric.You can either buy the flannel directly off the bar, or buy it prepackaged. If you buy it prepackaged, then you won't be able to buy the correct size. Make sure to buy a prepackaged piece of fabric that is larger than what you need so that you can cut it down to the correct size later on.
While this section is dedicated to showing you how to make a cape, you can, if you want, substitute this step by buying a simple red apron or robe, and tying it to your neck backwards.

, Lay your flannel on a flat surface, free of other items, food, etc. At one of the short ends of the fabric, lay a ruler down. Find the middle of the short end (will vary depending on your individual dimensions) and make a pencil mark. On each side of this mark, measure 4 inches away along the edge. Make a mark at each of these two points.Use scissors to cut into your fabric longways about 10 inches at each of the two 4 inch marks. You should now have a rectangular flap with only one side still left on. Cut this side off as well and throw away the rectangle.

, Grab a piece of black felt. Take an empty, dry drinking cup and flip it upside down. Trace the rim of the cup against the black felt with a pencil. Do this twice so that you have two circles. Use a pair of scissors and cut each of these circles out of the felt., Get out your sewing machine. You will want to use standard red thread for this project. Turn your cape so that the bright side you wish to show off is facing upright. Take one of your shoulder flaps, and place it halfway down one of the black felt circles. The middle edge of the strap should meet the middle of the felt circle. You can either pin them together, or hold them together tightly with your hands, as you apply a 1/2 inch inseam with your sewing machine.Attach the second black felt circle to the other shoulder strap in the same way.
You can also sew them together by hand. For more information on how to do this, visit How to Sew Blanket Stitch


, All you have to do is to attach a safety pin to each of the black medallions. Then simply pull the cape around your shoulders, and slide each of the pins through your shirt to keep it from falling off., Wrap a fabric tape measure around the edge of the plate. Hold it there, as you make a pencil mark every third of the way around. For example, if the total distance around the plate was 24 inches (61 cm), it would be best to make marks on the edge of the plate at the 8, 16, and 24 inch (61 cm) marks. Remove the tape measure, and draw a dot in the center of the paper plate.Use a ruler to connect each of the outside edge marks to the center dot. Draw connecting lines with a pencil.
Then, use a pair of scissors to cut out each of the three pieces. You will only need two pieces but leave the third piece aside in case you make a mistake later on.

, Place your two pieces together on a flat surface, as if they were the bottom two pieces of a plate. Use a fabric tape measure, and start measuring at the bottom corner where both plates meet. First, measure along the edge of the right piece, making a pencil mark at the 1 1/2, 3, and 4 1⁄2 inch (11.4 cm) marks. Flip your tape measure around to the other piece, once more starting to measure from the bottom corner where both pieces meet. Make a mark along the outside edge of the left piece at the 1 1/2, 3, 4 1/2 inch marks.Between the 1 1/2 and 3 inch marks on both pieces, you will use a pair of scissors to cut out a triangle that is about 1 inch (3 cm) tall. The edge of the paper plate is the base of the triangle. It does not matter if it is perfect, but the edges you cut out should be straight, and fairly symmetrical between right and left pieces.
Do the same thing in between the 3 and 4 1/2 inch marks on both pieces. However, instead of a 1 inch tall triangles, you will make these about 1 1⁄2 inch (3.8 cm) tall. Try to keep the edges of the triangle straight, and fairly symmetrical between right and left pieces.

, First, take a measuring tape, and wrap it around your head. Hold the end of the measuring tape down against your head, as you bring the other end around to meet it. Make sure it is sitting on your ears as you wrap it around. You will want to determine the circumference of your head in inches.Add three inches to the circumference length. Take a ruler and measure out a rectangle on a piece of paper that is 2 inches wide X (circumference + 3 inches) long. For example, if the circumference is 10 inches, the dimensions of your rectangle would be 2X13 inches.

, Cut out a triangle from the middle part of the top edge of your rectangle. On the top long edge, make a pencil mark at the middle (use a ruler). Then make a pencil mark on each side of the middle mark, each 1 inch away. Use a pair of scissors to cut out an upside-down triangle 1 inch tall (the two 1 inch marks will be the distance of your base).When you get done, you should have one long strip of paper, with an upside-down triangle cut out of it.

, Lay old newspapers down on a table, and place your three pieces (headband, two wings) on top of them. Get out a can of acrylic silver spray paint. Use slow, smooth strokes as you spray the paint. Wait about an hour for one side of the three pieces to dry before you flip them over and coat the other side.It is important that you do this in a safe location. You do not want to spray paint around other people, and you do not want to spray paint in a contained room, like a garage. If the room you are painting in has windows or doors, open them up to get air circulation.
You should also consider wearing a doctor's mask so that you don't breathe in the fumes. Wearing old t-shirts is also important so that you don't get paint on your nice clothes.

, First, place a small amount of super glue on the end of the headband. The glue should cover 3 inches at the end of the strip of paper. Curl the headband around, bringing both ends together. Press them together so that the glue binds them. Hold them for about a minute.Place a small amount of super glue in the middle of each of the wings. Note that when you place your wings on the headband, the wings will curve inward. This means the glue goes on the sides of the pieces of paper plate where you would put food on.
Position the headband so that the triangle is upside-down, and in front. The cut out triangles of the wings are positioned low, while the uncut part of the wings are positioned high.
Press each wing onto each side of the headband. Hold them there for about a minute so that the glue has time to dry.

, You will want to find a pair of black boots. These could be work boots, or ones you find at a costume shop. The closer the boot rises to the knee, the better. A pair of dark blue or black pants should also be worn with your costume. Leather works best, however you can also wear a dark pair of jeans.

, Look for stores which sell tights for your arms. You will want a silver pair which will cover your forearm areas, up to your shoulders. If you can only find standard colors, you can always spray paint the tights a silver color. Leggings can also be substituted for arm tights. You simply have to cut the feet out of them so your hands can slide through.


Any silver medallions (broaches) you own should be pinned to your chest area. It is best to keep the medallions symmetrical, so make sure you have two, one for each side of your chest. These medallions should also be round.

, Thor has longer hair, down to the shoulder. If you do not have long hair already, it is best to go purchase a wig (blonde for the movie Thor version). If you have long hair, simply apply a gel to your hair. Then take a comb and work it back and down. Thor's hair looks perfectly combed and lays flat against the shoulder and back area.

Lay the black shirt and red shirt flat on your work surface.
Use a ruler or tape measure to find the exact center of each top. Draw a line down the center using chalk or fabric pencil.
Use your ruler to draw another line 1 inch (2.5 cm) away from the center line. On the black shirt, draw the second line to the left of the center line when facing it. For the red shirt, draw the second line to the right of the center line when facing it.;
, Use sharp sewing shears to cut along the second lines on both shirts.


Do not cut along the center lines. If you cut on the center lines, you will not have enough material for a hem.
You may need to pin the front and back of the shirts together so that you can make an even cut on the front and back. Otherwise, redraw the center and second lines on the back of the shirts and cut the backs out separately from the fronts.
Save the extra fabric to create diamond appliques for the sleeves.

, Turn the shirts inside-out and sew a straight line along this seam.


Using a sewing machine and red or black thread, sew a straight line along the seam to attach the two shirts together. Backstitch the ends to secure them.
If sewing the costume by hand, use a backstitch to sew a straight line from the top to the bottom of the shirts.
Stitch up both sides before turning the shirt right-side-out again.

, If you are going for a classic Harley Quinn look, you will need to attach three diamonds onto the sleeves of your shirt.


Trace and cut out three diamonds from your extra black fabric and three from your extra red fabric. The diamonds should be about 2 inches (5 cm) tall and 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide.
Sew the three red diamonds in a partial-diamond pattern on the upper portion of the black sleeve. The diamonds should be facing out.
Sew the three black diamonds in a partial-diamond pattern on the lower portion of the red sleeve. These diamonds should be facing out, as well.

, This option is more for those who are interested in mimicking the ""Arkham Asylum"" version of Harley Quinn rather than the classic look.


Lace a black corset around your waist, over the sewn red-and-black tank top. If possible, thread the tank top with red strings or belts. If you don't have a corset then take a black strapless shirt (with sweetheart neckline) then put that over the shirt and tie a belt over.

, Pants have a center seam that extends from the top of the waist, down in between the legs, and back up to the waist again. Use a thread puller to yank out all the thread holding the two halves together.


If you simply cut the jeggings, you will likely end up with a situation in which you will not have enough extra fabric to stitch the two halves together.
You could also use leggings, but jeggings are made from a thicker material and are easier to work with for this project.
If possible, use jeggings made by the same manufacturer so that the two halves will fit together more readily.
Save the color halves that are opposite of the colors used for your shirt. Since the right arm of your shirt should be black and the left arm of your shirt should be red, the right leg of your pants should be red and the left leg of your pants should be black.
Save the excess material for your diamond appliques.

, Turn the Jegging halves inside out and pin the red and black halves together along the unstitched hemming fabric. Sew a straight line from the waist, through the legs, and back up to the other side of the waist.


Use red or black thread.
If using a sewing machine, use a straight stitch and backstitch the ends to keep them in place.
If sewing by hand, use a backstitch to create a sturdier seam.
Test the pants out. Before strutting your stuff, you should wear the sewn-together pants to make sure that there are no holes and that the seams hold as you sit, walk, and bend.

, Cut out three black diamonds and three red diamonds from your scrap fabric. The diamonds should be about twice as large as the diamonds used for your top.


Sew the three black diamonds in a partial-diamond pattern on the upper portion of your red leg.
Sew the three red diamonds in a partial-diamond pattern on the lower portion of your black leg.

,


Create as even a look as possible. The white cream should extend from your hairline down to the base of your head, where your head meets your neck. You do not need to include your ears, eyelids, or mouth, however.

, Your eye shadow, eyeliner, and mascara should all be black.Brush a black eye shadow over the lid of your eye.
Apply a thick line of black gel eyeliner along the top and bottom lids. Gel liner smears more easily than pencil liners, which is what you will need for this look.
Brush black mascara onto your upper and lower eyelashes.
Use a moist cotton swab to smear the eye make-up. It should look messy, yet still fairly attractive.
Use a little of the black gel liner to create ""tear"" lines. Apply the gel liner in short, quick strokes extending out from the lower lid line. Only create a few so that they look distinct. Smudge them slightly with your cotton swab to smooth them out.

, You could also use blood red lipstick, but whatever you choose, it must be dark.

, Sponge the blush quickly over the apples of your cheeks, giving your cheeks just a hint of color.

, Flat leather fashion boots work best, but you could also go for boots with a short heel.


Ankle boots work for either version of the costume, but you could also go with knee-high boots if you plan to wear an “Arkham Asylum” version.
Technically, Harley Quinn has one red boot and one black boot. If you have cheap boots and you do not mind permanently altering them, use red fashion spray paint to color one boot red. The red boot should be whichever boot goes over the black leg of your pants.

, Costume gloves or thin knit gloves both work, but the gloves must be made from a thin material either way.


Invert the colors of your top for your gloves. The red glove should correspond to the black half of your shirt while the back glove should correspond to the red half of your shirt.
Add white wrist ruffles to both wrists. The easiest way to do this is to wear white scrunchies or white ruffled hair elastics around your wrists.

, This only applies if you plan on going for a classic Harley Quinn look.


Try to find a jester hat that is red and black. Otherwise, it will not match your costume.

, This applies if you are going for an ""Arkham Asylum"" look or if you are unable to find a jester hat.


Find a long blonde wig. Tie the wig into two high ponytails on either side of your head.
Tie red and black ribbon around your ponytails. You can either use both red and black on both ponytails, or you can use red ribbon on the side that corresponds to the black half of your shirt and black ribbon on the side that corresponds to the red half of your shirt.

, Harley Quinn wears a black mask that just barely covers her eyes and part of her nose.


A black masquerade mask bought at a craft store should work, but if it appears to cover too much of your face, you can always trim it down so that it only outlines your eyes.
Make sure that the elastic band goes beneath your wig or hat.

The acceptable places for there to be a logo or writing on the shirt are the middle of the chest and the back of the collar, as these will be covered by the emblem and the cape.;
, Purchase some blue leggings either online or at a clothing store. Try to find leggings in a blue that's as close to the color of the shirt you found as possible.


Note that for men shopping online, you'll have to get a size or two smaller than usual when shopping for women's leggings.
You can also get blue tights instead, either at an online dance-wear store, or a dance store near you.

, The results will contain several photos of the superman emblem. Find one that's red and yellow. Do not worry if it has black outlines, as you are going to be cutting it out anyway. Print out the superman emblem.

, Any copy center will show you how to blow the image up larger. Go to a local copy center like Kinkos or Fed-Ex. Make a copy of the image that is large enough to fit on the chest of the shirt..


Before making the larger copy, you'll want to measure the width of the chest of the shirt. Take 2-4"" off that measurement. That's roughly how wide you'll want the final ""S"" emblem to be. The exact size is up to you.

, Use a utility knife to cut out the yellow from the printed out emblem. This will leave just the red ""S"", which you'll use as a stencil.

, Glue the stencil to a piece of red felt with a craft spray adhesive. Use a pen to trace the outside of the emblem on the felt. Cut the emblem shape out of felt. Trace the internal parts of the emblem with a pen and cut those out with a utility knife.You can also use sheets of craft foam to cut out the emblem so it has a more 3-dimensional look. These craft foam sheets can be found at your local craft store or online: https://www.darice.com/store/browse/catalog/wholesale-foamies.

, Use rubber cement to attach the red ""S"" to a piece of yellow vinyl. Then cut the yellow vinyl around the red emblem so that you're left with a superman emblem in red and yellow., Put on the shirt so that you can get the placement right. Stand in front of a mirror and attach the emblem to the center of your chest using foam double-sided tape. Have a friend help you if you need it., Get about 4 yards of 60"" width fabric. You can use felt if you can’t find lycra. It’s best to choose a type of fabric that doesn’t fray and makes a clean line without hemming. Try to find a color as close the color of the red in your emblem as possible.

, Get someone to help you use measuring tape to measure from your collar to the top of your calves. Cut your red fabric to this length with fabric scissors., Tuck one to two inches of the red fabric into the back collar of the shirt. Pin it in place. You'll need a friend to help you do this while you wear the shirt you're using for the costume., Take off the shirt or leotard you are using for your costume, ensuring the red fabric is pinned in place on the back of the shirt or leotard. Then, use needle and thread to secure the cape to the back collar of the shirt or leotard.If you have a sewing machine, you can sew the cape on by running the fabric through the machine.
To create a finished look, hem the sides and bottom of the cape with a one-fourth inch (0.6cm) hem using your sewing machine or using needle and thread.

, Look for high waisted men’s briefs in red at your local men’s clothing store or online.


The briefs will help to add a finishing touch to your superman suit.
If you cannot find a pair of men’s red briefs, you can try to Dye-Clothes|dye men’s cotton white briefs red using red dye. You should aim to get the right superman red color, using superman colors on the internet to find the right shade.

, If you cannot find a pair of men’s red briefs or if you are looking to really DIY this costume, you can make your own red briefs.


Start by finding a pair of men’s white briefs, preferably high waisted.

, You'll need a red fabric like spandex, lycra or polyester. Lay your red fabric on your worktable. Lay the briefs on the fabric so that the top hem of the briefs lines up with edge of the fabric. Trace around the briefs with a piece of tailor's chalk.


Add about two inches to the width of the briefs in your tracing, to account for the width of your body.

, First, cut out the brief shape, all the way to the crotch, without cutting out the whole thing. Flip the fabric over on itself where the crotch meets the fabric, as if you are making a reflection. Draw another chalk outline on the other side that connects at the crotch.

, Cut out your briefs. Fold them in half at the crotch. Pin the sides together, leaving the leg holes and top of the briefs open., Either hand sew or machine sew the sides of the briefs together with red thread. Try the briefs on over your tights or leggings., To make the briefs wearable, first measure a length of elastic that's the same measurement of your waist minus an inch. Sew the elastic into the inside of the top of the red briefs., Cut two slits that are about two inches (5cm) tall and one inch (2.5cm) apart just below the right hip bone and two slits just below the left hip bone. Repeat at the back and at the sides. These will be your belt loops., It should be just less than two inches (5cm) thick., In the back of the briefs, attach the belt to the briefs by sewing them in place. You want to do this in back, as the cape will cover it., Try to find cowboy boots, riding boots or rubber boots. The aim is to purchase boots that rise past mid calf, to mimic superman’s signature red boots.Look for boots that have very little in the way of patterns and embellishments. You're looking for the most basic calf high boots you can find.

, Pick a spray paint that is made for use on leather or vinyl and look for a glossy finish if you'd like your boots to be shiny. For full coverage, also purchase a primer. You will not need to sand down the boots as long as you use leather or vinyl specific spray paint.Spray the boots. Spray the outside of the boots with primer. Wait until it dries. Follow up with a few coats of red spray paint.Wait a day between coats. You may need two coats of red spray paint to cover the boots well., If you do not want to use spray paint, you can use red acrylic paint on the boots instead. You will first need to prep the boots by sanding them with fine grit sandpaper to remove any shiny areas on the surface of the leather or vinyl. Then, wipe the sanded leather or vinyl down with rubbing alcohol to remove any surface finishings or protective coatings.Make sure you paint the boots in an open space with painters cloth on any items you do not want to be painted red. Mix the paint with one part paint and one part water in a bowl. Use a paintbrush to apply one coat of paint to the boats. Do two to three coats total, allowing the paint to only partially dry between coats.
To prevent the leather from cracking, flex the leather with your hands between each coat of paint. Do not let the paint dry fully between coats, as this will cause the paint to crack.

Rinse with lukewarm water.,
Tap the harmonica after each use.,
Let your harmonica dry after playing.,
Clean your mouth before playing.",How to Clean a Harmonica1," If you have a diatonic harmonica with a plastic comb, simply run some lukewarm water through the harmonica. Placing the mouthpiece against your palm, tap it firmly to remove the water.Only run water through the harmonica if your comb is plastic or sealed wood. If the comb is wooden or metal, do not run water through it.;
, Because a harmonica is played with the mouth, saliva and other contaminants get blown into the instrument by the mouth. After each use, tap the harmonica on your hand, leg, or a towel to knock out any loose saliva. This will help keep it clean and help reduce the amount of build up in the instrument.Try to be a dry harmonica player. This means you should try to reduce the amount of saliva that you pass into the harmonica while playing., Another way you can help keep your harmonica clean and rust free is to let it dry after playing. When you place it in the case, leave the case open. This helps any moisture in the harmonica to dry instead of sitting there damp in your harmonica., If you have eaten or drunk anything right before playing, rinse your mouth with water. Remnants of food can get blown into the harmonica, and sugar or other contaminants from non-water beverages can build up a residue in the harmonica.Refrain from playing right after brushing your teeth. Any residue left over from the toothpaste or mouthwash can build up.
Don't smoke while playing the harmonica. This can damage the harmonica."

, You could use a half airsoft mask that only covers your mouth, or a full airsoft mask with the goggle portion removed.These can usually be found at sports equipment stores and can be cheaper than professional respirator masks.

, If you cannot find a full respirator mask, or if your budget does not permit it, you could buy a simple dust mask, also called a particle respirator, instead. These masks do not have mouthpieces or filters and are usually simple white masks that fit over your mouth


If possible, look for one that comes with a thick strap instead of one that uses elastic string.

, Twist or unscrew the filters on the side of your respirator mask. The mouthpiece of the mask can stay if it is fairly flat, but if it bulges out more than 1 inch (2.5 cm) or so, it should be removed, as well.


If you are using a full airsoft mask, remove the goggle portion and cut away any plastic that sits above the goggle glass.
Use a sharp knife or saw to remove this plastic.
Sand down any sharp edges with an electric sander to avoid injuring yourself on your mask.

, Most professional respirator masks and airsoft masks have a small hole where the mouthpiece is/was located, in which case, you do not need to make a cut. If using a dust mask, however, you will need to cut a hole 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) across, directly above the point where your mouth will be.


To get a better idea of where the mouthpiece needs to be, place the dust mask on your face and use a pencil to mark where your mouth is on the mask. Remove the mask and cut the hole using scissors or a utility knife.

, Use hot glue to attach these four pieces at even intervals along the top of the mouthpiece. The opposite should be glued down to the top part of the nose piece on your mask.


If you do not have a mouthpiece on your mask, put the mask on your face and lightly mark with pencil a line where your upper lip is. Arrange the pieces of tubing along this line at even intervals.
Thin tubing like this can usually be found in a hardware store.
For an easier, cheaper alternative, you could use flexible straws instead of tubing. Cut, bend, and shape the straws before gluing them down.
Fabric glue or jeweler's glue can be used in place of hot glue if hot glue is unavailable.

, Cut another four 3½ inch (8.89 cm) pieces of ½ inch (1¼ cm) tubing. Use hot glue to attach these evenly along the bottom of the mouthpiece section. The other end of each piece of tubing should be glued down to the chin portion your mask.


If you do not have a mouthpiece on your mask, put the mask on and lightly mark the line where your lower lip is with a pencil. Arrange the pieces of tubing along this line equally.
As suggested earlier, you might use bendy straws as an alternative to tubing.

, Cut two 4½ inch (11.43 cm) pieces of ½ inch (1¼ cm) tubing and two 7½ inch (19 cm) pieces of ½ inch (1¼ cm) tubing. Starting with the smaller pieces:


Hot glue the smaller pieces directly next to the end pieces of tubing above the mouth. The lower end of these two new pieces of tubing should be hot glued to the sides of the mouthpiece.
If your mask does not have a mouthpiece, then glue the other end to the midpoint in between your top and bottom mouth tubing rows.
Hot glue the larger pieces next to those you just glued on to the top end. Glue the bottom end of these final pieces of tubing next to the bottom end of the lower mouth tubing row.
As previously mentioned, you could use bendy straws as an alternative to tubing.
Let everything dry completely so you do not break loose the seal of your glue.

, Cut a strip of pleather, or other tough black cloth, so that is twice as wide as the width of your straps and just as long. Use hot glue or fabric glue to cover the side-straps with this material, hiding the seam or ends of the material on the inside of the strap.If you do not have wide straps on your mask and only have thin elastic cord, go out and buy a band of 2 inch (5 cm) thick black elastic.
Cut this piece of elastic to match the length of your elastic cord and glue it to the mask over the cord.
Keep the edges of this band on the inside of the mask to hide them.

, Use a soft tape measure to determine the distance from the tip of your nose to the base of your skull. Also measure the width of the bridge of your nose at both the top and bottom.


For a more accurate fit, place the mouthpiece portion of your mask on before proceeding.
Measure from the top of this mouthpiece, over your face and head, and down to the point at which the strap meets in the back of your head.

, Look for black soft foam that is no thicker than ½ inch (1¼ cm). Use fabric scissors to cut out a strip of foam that matches the measurement of the top of your head, plus one inch (2½ cm) to allow overlap for gluing., To begin with, the foam should be as thick as the widest part of your nose. Next, you will contour the shape of your strip to fit your nose better.

, On one end of the foam, narrow down the part where the upper bridge of your nose will be. If necessary, place the foam over your head temporarily and mark the area you will need to trim with a pencil.

, Lay your foam over another piece of black pleather and trace the shape onto the other material. Use fabric scissors to cut the shape out of the pleather.


If you do not have pleather, choose another durable, tough black fabric.

, Apply thin lines of hot glue to the back of the pleather and press the foam in place onto the glue. Make sure that the edges line up as evenly as possible.

, The narrowed part of your headpiece needs to be hot glued just above the top part of your mask nose piece. The wider, even section of the back of your foam strip should be glued to the pleather-covered strap in the back.


Make sure that the strap goes across the front, top, and back of your head in a straight line.
Glue the edges of the foam headpiece to the inside of your mouthpiece, hiding them from sight.

, Cut two pieces of ½ inch (1¼ cm) tubing that match the measurement you took of the top of your head. These pieces should be the same length as the strip of fabric that covers the front, top, and back of your head.


Hot glue these pieces of tubing along the edges of the top headpiece, one tube to each edge.

Note: these pieces of tubing are too long to substitute plastic flexible straws. If you cannot find tubing, you could either skip this step or use pipe cleaners covered in pleather in place of the tubing.

, Take small bolts and hot glue them in pairs along the top headpiece. Each bolt should be on the inside of the tubing along the edge of your headpiece.


You should have five to eight pairs of bolts, or 10 to 16 individual bolts, in total.
Space the pairs apart at even intervals.
If you do not have bolts, you can use belt studs or similar metallic objects, instead.

, Bane's mouthpiece is a dark, intimidating black. To get a consistent, uniform appearance, use spray paint that is labeled to work on a variety of materials (metal, plastic, fabric) and spray the entire mask black.Depending on where you spray paint, you may want to put a layer of newspaper or a drop cloth down before spray painting.
Let your mask dry for several hours in a warm spot with low humidity.

, For a slightly more authentic look, you can use silver metallic paint and a paintbrush to paint the tubing of your mask silver. This is not strictly necessary, but can add more realism to the final mask.


Check the label to make sure that the paint is safe for use on plastic.
Let the paint dry.

, Your Bane mask should now be complete. Try it on and see how it looks. If you notice that the straps are loose or tight, make necessary adjustments by trimming down or gluing extra fabric to lengthen the straps.

Finished.

",How to Design a Costume for a Superhero," Usually, the whole costume should be one or two colours/shades only. Doing this just ensures that the costume does not distract from your superhero. When figuring out the colours of the costume, think of the powers your hero will have. For example, using a wide variety of colors for the costume isn't a good idea unless the powers of the hero are related to a rainbow.;
, Will it cover the whole body? Does it have a cape? Design the actual outfit first, before figuring out the logos. Once you have designed your costume, it gives you a blank slate to work with. Find a signature letter or symbol that relates to your superhero. For example, Spiderman has a spider and spider-web design on his costume, Batman has a bat logo, and Superman has an 'S' logo.

, What kind of mask will your hero wear? Will it cover the whole face, or only the eyes? The colour should go along with the characteristics of the hero. For example, Batman has a black mask because his name has the word bat in it, which is related to the dark. Alternatively, will your hero even have a mask at all? Not all superheroes have to have masks! Think of Superman, for example.

, Most superheroes carry a utility belt with them. You will have to decide how it looks and what it contains inside it. Consider having your superhero have a signature weapon that they carry with them in their utility belt (The most notable is Batman).

, A superhero could have gadgets built inside his costume as well.

The Dark Knight: This is a darker version of Batman that began to appear after the Batman Begins movie. This portrayed Batman as more of a dark outcast in Gotham city, a vigilante who lives outside the law. Alfred Pennyworth said it best, in the movie The Dark Knight when he said, ""Endure, Master Wayne. Take it. They'll hate you for it, but that's the point of Batman, he can be the outcast. He can make the choice that no one else can make. The right choice.""

The World's Greatest Detective: This is the iconic comic-book version of Batman. This batman costume is more playful and colorful (with the bright yellow accents) and follows a more detective-style way of fighting crime. This costume best depicts a Batman character who is witty enough to yell ""freeze!"" to Arnold as Mr. Freeze.
