The Man in the Mask.",How to Build Your Own Batman Costume2," Unlike the first Batsuit, the Dark Knight's suit is a lot more sophisticated. Here's how to make one.


Start with full-body pant suit or unitard. It should be all black fabric and long sleeve. It should be extremely fitted and stretchy for optimal mobility. You can find them at stores that sell ballet clothing, or if you will be spending time outside when the weather is colder, you can go for neoprene body suit like those that divers, surfers, and paddlers use (and which may be a little more forgiving if you're not fresh from training with Ra's al Ghul and the League of Shadows.
Add on armour. Use a black paintball armor to create the hard shell of the bat suit. Every part of your body should have this hard shell on it, but you especially want to cover the chest and upper arms.
Pump it up. Batman's suit clearly indicates how big each and everyone of his ab muscles are, to strike fear into the hearts of villains and scoundrels. You can pad the abs by adding large amounts of Puffy Paint (available at Walmart) to the armour, or use dense, paintable styrofoam (available at craft stores) to build up muscles.
Add the Batman crest. The Batman crest covers the center of your chest. It should be the all-black bat symbol and there should be nothing around it. You can use this template: just print it as large as you need, trace it onto cardboard, and carefully cut out with a box cutter.
Add the gloves. The gloves should be elbow length, all black and should have three ""fins"" attached to the sides. These fins should be stiff and angling backwards towards Batman.;
, This is the stiff black or dark metal belt with a large square pockets on the sides that house Batman's gadgets. You can use an inexpensive webbing belt with a black buckle, and empty jewelry boxes or eyeglass cases for the pouches.

, Go the extra mile and try adding utilities such as a Bat-monitor (black walkie-talkie), Bat-cuffs (spray paint handcuffs black), a Bat-lasso (black climbing rope), a Bat-Tracer (anything black with a blinking red or blue LED), Batarangs (anywhere that sells novelty boomerangs, painted black), etc.

, You should have a floor length, straight cut at the bottom, black cape. A sheet, dyed black, should do the trick nicely. Cotton is good, satin is better. Kevlar is best. Good luck with that last one!

, These boots can be closer to military boots than rain boots. The less lacing or buckling the more authentic the boot will look.

, Crown your costume with the perfect Batman mask. Buy a black rubber mask with pointed ears that extend from top sides of your head. Your nose should be stiff and pointy. The mouth and chin should be completely exposed and the eyes should have very little other than the whites of your eyes exposed.


Use black make up to ""black-out"" the skin surrounding your eyes so that the mask makes you look more like the Dark Knight.

Start with full-body pant suit or unitard. It should be neutral or slightly bluish-gray, with long sleeves. Unless you're already ripped, it should fitted loosely so that you can pad. You can find them at stores that sell ballet clothing, or if you will be spending time outside when the weather is colder, you can go for neoprene body suit like those that divers, surfers, and paddlers use.
Don't worry about getting a unitard if you can't find one—the utility belt will make the suit look continuous. Do make sure your pants are not loose at the bottom—they need to tuck into your boots.

, Not boxers. Batman is an outsider, he has no problem wearing his underwear on the outside of his gray suit. So find a pair that has nothing written on them. Dark blue will also work, depending on the bat-era you are trying to emulate.

, Use shoulder pads that you can get from a fabric store to add muscles to your body to fill out the suit, or use balloons partially inflated.

, It will need to cover the center of your chest. The look of the crest has been interpreted two different ways: A yellow sideways oval with all black ""bat"" symbol on the inside OR an all-black ""bat"" symbol without anything around it.

, The gloves should be elbow length, should match the color of your Bat-briefs, and should have three fins attached to the sides. These fins should be stiff and angling backwards towards Batman.

, This is the iconic yellow belt with a large gold Batman symbol on the front and small square yellow pockets that house Batman's gadgets. You can probably find a vinyl yellow belt at Goodwill or Salvation Army. Barring that, there's always the costume store, which may have a yellow Bat Utility Belt.

, Go the extra mile and try adding utilities such as a Bat-monitor (walkie-talkie), Bat-cuffs, a Bat-lasso, a Bat-Tracer (anything with a blinking LED), Batarangs (anywhere that sells novelty boomerangs, painted black or yellow), etc.

, You should have a floor length black cape with jagged edges and blue lining. The edges should be reminiscent of bat wings.

, These should come up just below the knee. There shouldn't be any sort of lace or strap on the boots. Batman doesn't have time to deal with that. Try all black rain boots.

, Create a black fabric mask with pointed ears that extend from top sides of your head. You should have a pointy (pyramid-like) nose. The mouth and chin should be completely exposed and the eyes should have almond shaped holes for visibility purposes.

",How to Build Your Own Batman Costume4," The obvious choices are:


Catwoman. Friend, or foe? Who's to know. Whichever she is, there's not much that needs to be said about this costume.Be prepared to meet your match, Caped Crusader:
Robin, the Boy Wonder. Make sure Robin is appropriate for the Bat-era you have chosen. The Dark Knight's Robin's costume is black with red accents, whereas the traditional Robin is a little more colorful:
The Joker. Green hair, white face, blackened eyes, smeared red lipstick, and a purple suit will get you most of the way there. Just how ragged you make the makeup and how flamboyant the suit will determine if you're early Joker, or later Joker.
Other great foes that make for great costume opportunities could be The Riddler, Catwoman, Poison Ivy, Two-Face, the Penguin, Mr. Freeze, or Bane.

Try to get a jumpsuit that zips up the front, with a high neckline and long sleeves. These type of jumpsuits are readily available at most costume or Halloween stores, or can be found online and purchased off eBay.


If you don't have the time or money to buy a PVC jumpsuit, you can piece together a similar look using items already in your wardrobe. Tight leather pants, leather or wet look leggings, or even a tight pair of black jeans can be used for the pants.
A tight black turtleneck sweater will form the top.;
, Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman jumpsuit had white stitching detail all over, so that's the look your are trying to recreate. First grab some white chalk and draw the outline of the jagged lines you want to create.


Place them at random all over the the PVC suit (or top and trousers), using a picture of the Catwoman costume from the movie for reference. Then take a needle and length of white thread and start stitching over the white lines.
If you're tight for time, you can simply use the white chalk to create the stitched effect, or paint over the chalk with some white-out.

, Possibly the most important part of Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman costume was her headpiece -- a black PVC half-mask with cat ears. In order to achieve an authentic-looking headpiece, it may be best to buy a replica mask off Amazon or eBay. These sites often sets which include a headpieces, gloves and claws. However, if you are on a budget, you can make your own Catwoman headpiece at home. Here's how:


Take an old pair of black cotton sweatpants. Make sure that there is some stretch in the material and that you can fit the leg of the pants over your head.
Cut off the bottom of the sweatpants -- the piece you cut off should be long enough to cover half your face, reaching just above the tip of your nose. There should also be several inches of material above the top of your head, to make the ears.
Take a piece of white chalk and draw a white semi-circle on the cut side of the material. This is the line you will cut out to form pointy ears on both sides of the mask. Also draw two large eyes on the mask, using a picture from the movie for reference.
Take a sharp scissors and cut out the semi-circle along the chalk line. Also cut out the two eye holes. Take a needle and some black thread and sew the top of the mask closed - there should now be pointy ears on top of the head. Try the mask on -- if it feels too loose along the sides, add a couple of stitches to tighten it.You can wear the mask as it is, or you can add the same white jagged stitching you did on the jumpsuit. Again, use a picture of Michelle Pfeiffer's headpiece from the movie as reference.

, To achieve Catwoman-worthy talons, all you need to do is find a pair of elbow-length, black gloves - if you can find them in a shiny material, that's great, otherwise any kind of material will do. Take a sharp scissors and cut slits in the tip of each finger.


Find a packet of black fake nails - the longer and pointier the better. Apply them to your own fingernails, then slip on the gloves - the pointy ends of the fake nails should poke right through the slits. Tah-dah!
Of course it is also possible to buy Catwoman gloves online with the nails already attached - but this method gives you the option of taking the gloves off and still having cat-like claws!

, To complete the look, you will need some knee-high black boots with a killer heel. Give them a good polish before you wear - Catwoman wouldn't dare leave the house in scuffed shoes!

, Halle Berry's Catwoman sported a slightly different look to her other incarnations, so no need for a jumpsuit this time. For the pants you will need leather or wet-look pants -- you should be able to find a suitable pair at a Halloween or costume store.


Although the pants should be tight at the top, the legs should widen slightly at the bottom -- in the movie, Halle Berry's pants are bootcut rather than skinny.
Take some white chalk and draw jagged lightening bolt shapes all over the legs of the pants -- front and back. Then take a sharp scissors and cut along the lines to a achieve a ripped effect.
Don't worry about cutting neatly -- you want to look as though you were attacked by a horde of angry cats!

, You need to be prepared to flash some flesh with this costume! If possible, find a PVC or leather-look bra or cropped bustier to mimic Halle Berry's hardcore lingerie from the movie. If you can't find anything suitable in those materials, silk is your next best option.


And hey, if you have time before you actually need to wear the costume, why not work on achieving a flat stomach -- the best accessory this costume could have!
If you are not comfortable revealing that much flesh, or you plan on being outdoors, a good alternative is to wear a black, strappy bodysuit instead. Just make sure you put some rips and tears in it as well, to achieve the claw-ravaged look!

, Halle Berry's wore a complicated, criss-crossed belt contraption that connected her bra straps to her pants. An exact replica of this would be hard to achieve, but you can create a similar effect simply by wrapping two belts around your waist, crossing them over to form an ""X"" shape. Ideally the belts would be made from canvas, in black or dark khaki green, but any kind of belts will do the job.

, Like Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman, Halle Berry's interpretation of the feline anti-heroine includes a black half-mask with cat ear detail. This Catwoman is matte black, without any white-stitching detail. You best bet is probably to buy an exact replica online, however you can also make your own mask using the method outlined in Step 3 of the previous section.

, If you want to stay really true to the movie, you should wear some open-toed black shoes or boots, with an average-sized heel. However, any kind of shoes or boots will do, as long as the legs of the pants are worn over them, rather than tucked in.

, The finishing touches to this Catwoman look are a pair of black leather gloves -- over the elbow, if possible --- and a black leather whip You can find costume whips in Halloween stores or online, or you can do a makeshift version by painting a jump rope black.

, The most recent incarnation of Catwoman was portrayed by Anne Hathaway in The Dark Knight Rises. This is perhaps the simplest version of the Catwoman costumes, but that doesn't diminish it's sexiness!


The basis of the costume is a black jumpsuit, with long sleeves and a zip up the front. If possible, try to get a jumpsuit in a matte black color, though shiny PVC will work if not.
If you can't get your hands on a jumpsuit, some tight black pants or leggings and a black zip-up or turtleneck sweater will do the trick.

, A wide black belt should be worn around the waist to imitate Catwoman's utility belt. However, if you could get your hands on a real gun holster, that would be even better!

, Anne Hathaway's Catwoman, unlike the others, does not wear a headpiece, but wears a simple black mask and headpiece, with her hair worn loose down her back. In this respect, she is similar to the version of Catwoman portrayed by Julie Newmar in the 1960s series Batman. Any plain black mask (that just covers the eyes) will work for this outfit, along with a headband or clips with cat ears attached.


You can make your own mask using black felt (an embossed black works really well for this particular costume). Simply draw the outline of the mask onto the piece of felt, cut it out neatly, and attach a length of black elastic to either side to form a mask.To make your own cat ears: cut out two triangular-shaped pieces from some black cardstock, glue black PVC or felt fabric to both sides of the cardstock, then attach each ear to a black alligator clip.

, Any kind of long black gloves will work for this costume, just try to get ones which reach above your elbow.

, Perhaps the most attention-grabbing aspect of this Catwoman's outfit are her thigh-high, black leather boots. If you have some in your wardrobe already - great! If not, you may need to trawl through some shoes stores or websites to find the perfect pair. The heels should be 4 or 5 inches (10.2 or 12.7 cm) high.


Of course, knee-high black boots will do in pinch - it all depends on how true to the movie you want your costume to be.

, Rather than carrying a whip, Anne Hathaway's Catwoman has a gun -- she means serious business. Find a fake black gun in any costume store. If you managed to find a gun holster belt, you can store it there!

, Unlike the other costumes, where hair is tied back or tucked underneath the mask, this look allows hair to be left loose. Anne Hathaway's hair was straight, but had plenty of volume. To achieve a similar effect, apply mousse to wet hair then blow dry hair straight, holding your head upside down. Pull the hair back from the face using the cat-ear headband or clips.

, To begin, apply your favorite foundation -- but mix it with a little white face paint first, as Catwoman is usually pale. Blend it well, using a stippling brush to create a flawless finish. Set the foundation with a loose translucent powder. Don’t use concealer beneath your eyes -- you want to have slight dark circles.

, Apply a matte taupe eyeshadow all over your lids; this will create depth and shadows. Bring the taupe shadow down towards the sides of your nose. Next, apply a dark brown eyeshadow around the creases of your eyelids, then apply a dark black eyeshadow to the center of your lids, blending it outwards.


Apply the black eyeshadow to your lower lash line with a small, angled brush, bringing it right into the corner of the eye. It should look a little messy.
Use a cotton swab to blend the shadow on your lower lash line to give a hazy, smoky effect.
Line the inner rim of your bottom lashes using a black eyeliner. Curl your eyelashes, then apply a black mascara generously to upper and lower lashes.

, Define your eyebrows with a brow pencil – give them an elaborate arch. Apply white eyeliner beneath the arch of the eyebrow to give it more depth and apply a matte white eyeshadow to the brow bone to highlight. Set your eyebrows with brow gel.

, Line your lips with a red lip liner, then fill in the lines with your favorite red lipstick. Use a brush to make a precise shape, referring to a specific Catwoman picture for reference. Use concealer to add extra definition to the outside of your lips. Apply a red lip gloss to the center of your lips, on top of the lipstick. Your lips should look playful and devious."

",How to Make a Batman Utility Belt," To make the buckle, you'll need 3mm foam, scissors, a X-Acto knife, and super glue.


Use 3mm foam. Use yellow foam for an all yellow utility belt, and black foam for an all black belt. Alternatively, you can use both black and yellow foam, using yellow for the base of the buckle and black for the Batman symbol.;
, For the design of the Batman buckle, you can make your own, using a picture of Batman's utility belt as a reference, or you can use a pattern, such as the one found here: http://www.thefoamcave.com/tutorials/how-to-make-a-utility-belt. Use a sharpie or a pen to draw the patterns in the foam.


For a basic Batman utility belt buckle, you'll need three pieces: an oval, a ring that goes around the edge of the oval, and a Batman symbol. The oval should be roughly 4"" across and 3"" tall. The ring should be the same dimensions of the oval but with the middle cut out. The Batman symbol should be no bigger than the inner dimensions of the ring.

, After you've drawn the three pieces on the foam, the oval, the ring, and the Batman symbol, and whatever other details you chose, cut them out. You can use scissors for the bigger pieces, like the base oval. For pieces with smaller details, like the Batman symbol, use an X-Acto knife.

, Glue the ring onto the edges of the oval to create a border. Glue the Batman symbol onto the center of the oval. Allow the glue to dry., To make the pouches, you'll need 5mm foam, scissors, a X-Acto knife, cardboard or cardstock, a ruler, velcro, and super glue.


Use yellow foam if you want a yellow Batman utility belt, and black foam for an all black belt.

, A basic pouch is made out of three foam pieces. The first piece is a long rectangle that is folded to form the front, back, and top flap. The other two pieces are shorter and narrower rectangles that function as the sides.


To create the first piece, make a pattern piece out of cardboard or cardstock that is 10.5 inches long and 4 inches wide.
To create the two side pieces, make 2 pattern pieces out of cardboard or cardstock that are 3 ⅜ inches long and ⅞ inches wide.
Cut out the pattern pieces.
The pouches on your utility belt may be any size you wish. Allow the items you intend to carry determine the size of the pouches—the pouch must be large enough to hold the item. To create a custom-sized pouch, use the length, width, and depth measurements of the items you plan to carry in the pouches of your utility belt.

, Trace each pattern piece onto the foam 4 to 6 times. Use scissors to cut out all the pieces.


If you have more room on your belt, you can always make more pouches.
You may need to round the edges of the side pieces with scissors so that they fit.

, Prior to construction the pouches, you must determine the flap length. And add one inch to this measurement to account for the width of the pouch.


Measure and mark the flap. From the top of the rectangle, use a ruler to measure and mark the length of your flap.
Place side pieces. Place a thin layer of glue along one long edge of a side piece—this edge will rest on the top of the large rectangle. Align the top of the side with the mark used to indicate the flap length and align the edge with glue flush with large rectangle’s left edge. Repeat this process with the other side piece, attaching it to the right edge of the large rectangle. Allow the glue to dry.
Place a thin layer of glue along each of the side piece’s bottom and side edge. Do not put glue on the top edge.
Fold the large rectangle up and over the base and side edges of the two side pieces. Hold the large rectangle in place as the glue sets.
Repeat this process until you have constructed each pouch.

, To prevent your pouches from opening, add a piece of velcro to the flap of each pouch.


Cut one small square of velcro for each pouch. Do not pull apart the velcro.
Glue one side of the velcro onto the inside of the front flap.
Place a small amount of glue onto the other side of the velcro.
Carefully fold the flap onto the front of the pouch and hold it firmly in place.
Once the glue has dried, rip apart the velcro., If you want to add canisters, you can use a number of different objects. You can use film roll canisters, or pill bottles, or some other cylindrical object that would fit on a belt., You'll want a thick leather belt to attach everything to. If you think you'll want to paint the whole thing yellow, it doesn't matter what color the belt is. If you want your Batman utility belt to be all black or have yellow pouches on a black belt, look for a black leather belt., You'll want to use super glue of some sort to glue everything to the belt. Krazy glue will work. Don't paint anything until it's all glued on, as glue doesn't stick to painted surfaces as well., Use acrylic paint to paint what you want to be a different color. This will usually include painting the canisters yellow and optionally painting the belt yellow. Use a small brush to get the edges where the belt meets the pouches so that there's no brown or black leather showing, if you want the belt yellow.,"

Practice!",How to Play the Tin Whistle," Whistles are available in all the major keys. The most common, a D whistle, can play in the keys of D and G major. The second most common, a C whistle, can play in the keys of C and F major. The lowest note of a penny whistle, with all the fingers covered, is called the tonic - on a D whistle the tonic is D.
The tone of the tin whistle is largely determined by its manufacturing. Clarke style rolled metal whistles tend to have a smooth soft sound, while Generation style cylindrical instruments tend to have louder or shrill whistle sounds. Inexpensive rolled metal whistles, such as those from Cooperman Fife and Drum (which also produces high-end instruments) may be very airy in sound, and may be difficult to play in the upper register (second octave). Often placing a piece of tape over one edge of the fipple slot (just below the mouthpiece) to narrow the fipple will improve the instrument's tone and playability significantly.




  Whistles are pitched in different keys and octaves.

Low whistles, or concert whistles, are longer and wider and produce tones an octave (or in rare cases two octaves) lower. Whistles in this category are likely to be made of metal or plastic tubing, with a tuning-slide head. The term soprano whistle is sometimes used for the higher-pitched whistles when it is necessary to distinguish them from low whistles.;
, It should face downwards and away from you at a 45 degree angle. Place your dominant hand at the bottom and your other hand at the top of the tube. Pinkies are not used except to support the whistle while playing certain notes, or when playing the largest (and lowest) tin whistles. Thumbs hold up the whistle from below. Cover the six keyholes with your fingertips. Place the tip of the fipple between your lips, but not between your teeth., The standard range of the whistle is two octaves. For a D whistle, this includes notes from the second D above middle C to the fourth D above middle C. (It is possible to make sounds above this range, by blowing with sufficient force, but, in most musical contexts, the result will be loud and out of tune.) As you go up a note on a whistle you generally lift one finger. Read the tablature for a D whistle below. White holes indicate that it is uncovered, black indicate covered, and plus signs below the fingerings indicate the higher octave.






, Hold the whistle with all the finger holes covered. (You don't need to press hard, just make sure each hole is completely covered.) Blow a steady stream of air, with your mouth shaped as if you were saying ""too"". This will produce the tonic (a D on the D whistle). Blowing too softly will make the note airy or nonexistent. Blowing too hard will produce the upper octave or a squeak. Blowing just right will create a steady, low tonic pitch. Progressively remove a finger at a time, starting by uncovering the hole at the end and working your way up to your mouth until you're playing the note with no holes covered (C#). You might need to use the pinky of your dominant hand to help support the whistle when none of the holes are covered., Cover all the holes again and blow harder than before to get a higher pitch. If you're having trouble hitting the note, slightly uncover the top hole (the one closest to your mouth) and try again. Doing this might help with all the notes in the higher octave. Like before, uncover the holes, one at a time until you get to the highest note (C#). As the notes get higher, you'll have to blow harder to reach it. If you overblow, however, the whistle will squeak., If you don't know already, learn how to read sheet music.




 A ""D"" whistle

If you have music transposed for a concert pitch instrument (violin, flute, piano) you can play this if it is in the right key. A player will usually play a whistle only in its tonic key and possibly in the key beginning on the fourth (e.g. G on a D whistle), but nearly any key is possible, becoming progressively more difficult to keep in tune as the player moves away from the whistle's tonic, according to the circle of fifths. Thus a D whistle is fairly apt for playing both G and A, and a C instrument can be used fairly easily for F and G.
To play a C natural on a D whistle or a B flat on a C whistle you can either half cover the top hole of the whistleor cover the two holes below the top hole. (The latter is more practical for faster playing.)


Click on the thumbnails below to see a few simple tunes.











, Not only should you be looking for clean, steady notes and smooth transitions between them, but you can also practice ornamentation:
Cuts - Just before you play a note, play a higher note for an instant. Snap one of your fingers off a hole momentarily to hit the next higher note. It should be so short that the listener can't determine the pitch.
Strikes - This is like a cut, except you go one note lower instead of higher.
Sliding up a note - Slide your finger slowly off a hole so that you ease into the next note. It should only take about half a second.

Vibrato can be achieved by varying the air speed slightly. Faster air means a higher tone, and slower air means a lower one, so by pulsing the air using your diaphragm, one can achieve vibrato. Don't blow too hard, or the instrument will play the next partial. Vibrato can also be achieved by opening and closing the second open hole counting down from the mouthpiece. For example, on the note A, play a normal A and wiggle your finger over the hole at the first finger of your dominant hand.

Depending on the size and number of your air horns, low pressures of 10-20 psi will probably be enough to make the horns make some noise, but not enough. 40-50 psi is a good range of pressure to make a loud noise, no matter what kind of horns you have. If you want to be really loud, put 100 psi air through your air horns. More than that pressure is unnecessary. If your air compressor goes much higher, it won't make a noticeable difference; 100 psi will be just as loud as 150 psi.

, If you are just needing to call your son in from the backfield, then the air horn and compressor is all you need. But, there is much more you can do with this loud device, and this is where the fun begins. The following information varies depending on your air horn's intended usage.

, This is necessary if you want to be able to use your horn away from your air compressor. You can try to use an old propane/freon tank, but these are very dangerous and you probably won't be able to get it to seal well. Tanks can be purchased from anywhere that sells air compressors. A 5 gallon (18.9 L) tank is more than enough. You will need at least 2 gallons (7.6 L) of compressed air if you want to honk it for more than 10 seconds. The speed the air leaves depends on the size of the fittings and tubing between the tank and the horns.

, This eliminates the need for the blowgun, but requires the purchase of pipes and tubing. If you can only get PVC valves, make sure they are at least schedule 40 or higher, but recommend buying a brass ball valve and get the correct fittings to make an airtight seal to your tank. Flexible air tubing is strong enough and will suffice between the valve and horns.

, This is necessary if you want to blow the horn by connecting a circuit. If you want to install the horn on a vehicle, this is necessary. Basically you need some device that turns the flow of air on or off; if you don't want to have to hold a blowgun up to it, or have to flip the ball valve, spend $20 and get a 12V solenoid from Ebay. If you buy the silver 12V solenoid that is common on Ebay, it will not give you directions on which way the air goes in. It goes in the side with the smaller fitting. You will need to buy brass fittings to make a tight seal between the solenoid and the air tank. The other side may just be a rubber tubing connection. The 12V should come from your vehicle's cigarette outlet, or another power source in your car (it's not a good idea to connect it directly to your car battery). Drill batteries work well also.

, This is highly recommended. It requires keeping an air tank in your truck full of compressed air and mounting an air horn somewhere. Then comes the trick of running an air tube from the tank to the horn. If you are putting the tank in your trunk, try drilling through the underbelly of your car, to keep the tube as short as possible.

, Since you will be honking this extremely fun and loud new horn on your car, the air tank will soon decrease it's pressure. Then your horn will sound wimpy until you re-pressurize the tank. Installing an on-board air compressor can be very tricky. First you need another air inlet or a tee, since you cannot use the same hole the solenoid is getting air from. You will need to buy a Schrader valve from the hardware store, and more fittings to seal it onto your tank while allowing the solenoid air also. Do not simply buy a 12V tire inflator and expect it to pressurize your 5 gallon (18.9 L) air tank from 0-100psi. They are handy because they plug into a cigarette outlet, but if it runs for more than 5 minutes, it will start to smoke, melt the cord, or self destruct. You need a commercial-quality 12v compressor, or a belt-driven compressor. The latter will likely be much more difficult to install.

Hold your harmonica correctly.,
Form a seal with your harmonica and mouth.,
Practice blocking notes.,
Control your breathing.",How to Bend a Note on Harmonica1," You should hold your harmonica nestled in your left hand, with your thumb supporting the bottom of the instrument and your other fingers along the top. The harmonica should be oriented so that the numbers printed on its holes are facing upwards.


Take your hand and form an open C-shape with your fingers and thumb. Your harmonica should be positioned deeply into the C-shape, tucked into the area where your thumb joins your hand.;
, You should not pucker your lips as you would for a kiss or play the harmonica with only the outer portion of your lips. The case of the harmonica will need to be in contact with the inner part of your mouth to give you proper control while playing. Your lips should touch the casing and the wood/plastic body should be inside your mouth.


For the best control and quality of tone, you should try to keep your jaw as relaxed as possible while playing.
Your jaw should be slightly lowered when playing your harmonica. This will create more space in your mouth and give your playing a richer tone.
While getting used to forming a proper mouth seal with your harmonica, it can be difficult holding the instrument in position while keeping your jaw relaxed. Take your time, and practice until this becomes second nature., Blocking is a harmonica technique that closes off other holes so you can play a single note. This is especially important for bending, as you can only bend a single note at a time on the harmonica. There are two different kinds of blocking:



Lip blocking is best for bending notes in blues and melody. Use your lips to block all other holes of your harmonica by narrowing the opening of your mouth to about the width of a pencil.

Tongue blocking closes off other notes that are open to your mouth by covering them with your tongue, leaving a single free hole to either side of your mouth. You won't need to narrow your mouth as much doing this as you would with lip blocking., When you play a note by exhaling it's called ""blowing."" Oppositely, playing a note by inhaling is called ""drawing."" For the best sound quality when playing, you shouldn't puff on your harmonica, but breathe through it with well supported breath.


You won't need to blast your harmonica with strong streams of air. You can get a full, rich sound from your harmonica with moderate amounts of sustained breathing.
As you become more skillful at playing the harmonica, you may find that you can breathe somewhat through the instrument to reduce the amount of full breaths you take. This can help you sustain long melodic phrases without a break in the sound."

Visit galleries near you and learn which ones show work that coincide with your style.,
Demonstrate how your art differs from other artists' works.,

Sign with a gallery.",How to Get Your Art Into a Gallery," Many galleries are run by a curator with distinct tastes, so play up to that. Research head curators and the work they show, ask yourself ""would this person like my art?"" Think about your medium, themes, approach, etc.;
, This is tricky, as your work may be similar to other work, but it can't be too closely related. Curators are business people, so they won't put all their eggs in one basket.


Believe in what you are creating. If it's not better than most of the art that's out right now, you need to focus more or try something very different. (How do you know it's better? You have the absolute conviction that it is.)

, Sell your enthusiasm and skill. Make them want it at that gallery and let people know you are highly interested in having your work there.

, When you apply for grants you expose yourself to artists and curators who are on judging panels. Even if you don't win, the art community sees that you are serious.

, Do not apply for exhibitions (or grants) that have an entry fee. These ""competitions"" are usually fundraisers for the organization or gallery and offer very little career advancement or prestige (and, in fact, including such a show on your artist's resume can make people take you less seriously). There are occasional exceptions to this rule (especially in regards to residencies), but for the most part you're best off not paying folks to consider your work. Especially avoid vanity galleries which charge you a fee to be included in a show (or to have a solo show). No legitimate gallery engages in this practice.

, You can invite other local artists, or other artists with similar styles as yourself.


Get digital images of your artwork. Once you have digital Images of your work, create a website and get a professional email address.

, Include as many examples of and information about your work as possible. Include a link to your artist web site. Include a short artist statement with your general approach to your creative life as a whole. Many curators like to collect paper documents on artists before they will show their work.


Email galleries in every major city you can travel to. Email as many as you can, to get their attention and in turn get them to look at your work.
Repeat this as often as every four months, have them even email you to stop until you have some galleys interested and conversing with you.

, These galleries normally don't take a cut of your work but require monthly membership fees. Even still, becoming a member can be very competitive, so you will need to present your work and artist statement for acceptance. These collectives usually don't contract you to show exclusively at that gallery.

, If you get accepted into a gallery, always have a contract. Galleries sell your work for you and take a cut, hence they are an agent, not a buyer. Ensure this cut is clearly specified in the contract. It's usually pretty steep, 20-50%, however, galleries want your work to be expensive because the more you make, the more they make. Thoroughly read any contract you sign, as it may stipulate that you may show and sell work exclusively through that gallery.

Familiarize yourself with holes you can bend on the draw.,
Practice playing a single hole on the draw.,
Vocalize on a single note draw.,
Practice draw bending notes.",How to Bend a Note on Harmonica2," Not all notes can be bent on the harmonica. Only holes one through six can be bent when drawing air through the instrument. You may find that you have better luck with one hole over another, but with enough practice, you should be able to bend notes freely.


Some holes bend more than others. If you aren't able to bend some notes as much as others, don't worry. This is natural.
The numbers on your harmonica should be on its mouthpiece, above each hole., Since you can only bend a single note at a time when playing the harmonica, you'll have to practice your lip or tongue blocking until you can consistently sound a single note. You should do this by drawing air into the instrument, and not blowing., As you inhale to play your single note on the harmonica, you should alternate between the sounds ""Eee"" (like the vowel in bee) and ""Ooo,"" (like the vowel in shoe) without breaking or pausing between those vowel sounds. This trick can oftentimes help beginners get a feel for bending notes.


Your jaw should lower when you transition from the ""Eee"" to the ""Ooo"" sound.
Another vocalizing technique that might help you uses the sounds ""Tee"" and ""Two."" Create these by striking the roof of your mouth close to your teeth when transitioning between the hard ""Eee"" and ""Ooo"" vowels.You can also use this inner mouth T-strike to give punch to your harmonica playing.

, Bending is largely intuitive. Once you learn how to bend notes on the harmonica, you'll likely develop an instinct for this technique that will help you master the other draw bends more quickly. Remember to be patient with yourself as you learn. After all, bending notes is an advanced technique."

Determine the correct holes for blow bending.,
Isolate a single note on the blow.,
Vocalize on the single note blow.,
Practice blow bending notes.",How to Bend a Note on Harmonica3," You can only bend a note on the blow (exhale) with holes eight through ten on your harmonica. Some of these notes will bend more than others, and you may find that some holes are easier for you to bend than others.You should experiment bending the notes of these blow bend holes to find which feels most comfortable to you.
You'll likely find that blow bending is a little more difficult than draw bending, although the two are similar in many ways. For this reason, it's recommended you first learn draw bending., Same as with draw bending, you'll need to narrow your mouth or block off other holes with your tongue so that you're only playing a single note while blow bending. Practice this until you can do so consistently with a full and rich tone.


Be sure you are only practicing this note on the blow. You will not be able to bend holes eight through ten on the draw., Opposite of blow bending, you'll need to start first with an ""Ooo"" sound (as in shoe) and transition to an ""Eee"" sound (as in bee). Your jaw should begin in a lower position for the ""Ooo"" and raise on the ""Eee.""


You may find it easier to punctuate your transition between vowel sounds with a T. Similar to draw bending, strike the roof of your mouth near the back of your front teeth when transitioning to between ""Two"" and ""Tee"" sounds., It may take you quite some time before you learn to blow bend naturally. If you're having difficulty, try adding variations to the intensity of your blow. You may also find that by altering your mouth shape, like dropping your draw extra low on the first vowel sound, helps you achieve your bend.

Choose a font or style for your letter.,
Write or trace a large uppercase letter.,
Write out the rest of the word if you wish.",How to Illuminate a Letter1," Decide on what font you’d like to use for your illuminated letter. You can choose a more old-fashioned or elaborate style as may have been used traditionally, or a more modern font from the current day.


Try a block letter with serifs, which are the small lines that can appear at the end of each stroke of a letter. Serifs can have a straight line, triangular, or curved ball shape.
Try a flowing script style for your letter. You can print out an example of something you like from the internet and trace it if you like. Try searching for Gothic, Blackletter, or Celtic styles of calligraphy for a traditional touch.;
, Sketch the outline of a letter, making it large enough to leave room for filling it with color and images. Write your letter freehand, or use a premade font for inspiration or tracing.


Use a ruler to sketch faint guiding lines if you want to keep the lines of your letter straight and precise. You can erase them later when you no longer need them.
It helps to draw the basic frame of the letter (just the lines that you would normally use to write it), then go back and add “weight” by giving the frame a block or thicker curve shape, depending on your font., Write the rest of the letters that will follow the initial illuminated letter, if applicable. You can use the same font or style, or choose a simpler one for the remaining text.


Typically, the letters and words following an illuminated letter will be written or typed in a much smaller size and in a simpler, more readable style or font.
In a traditional illuminated manuscript, the rest of the text on the page would appear “wrapped” around the illuminated letter, to the side and below the letter on the page.

Determine your art display layout.,
Choose a wall space that is proportional in size and orientation to the art you want to display.,
Display wall art at the appropriate level.,
Accentuate your wall art display with lighting.",How to Display Art1," This applies when you plan on hanging multiple pieces of wall art together, as a group. The size, shape, type and number of objects in your display will determine how they should be arranged. Here are some suggestions:


Lay art pieces on the floor in order to get a visual of how they relate to each other in size, form, subject, theme and color. Depending on the desired effect, you may want to keep similar colors grouped together, or you may want to scatter colors in a random pattern. Pay special attention to how different sized pieces relate to each other; Large, predominant pieces should be balanced with smaller, minor pieces. Additionally, it makes sense to group pieces according to subject and theme.
Rearrange the objects as necessary, until you feel that they are pleasing to the eye and that they make sense logically, according to their characteristics.
Make sure there are equal amounts of space between each piece. For displaying art on the wall, a good rule of thumb is to space art pieces 3 inches (7.62 cm) to 4 inches (10.16 cm) apart.;
, Whether your art display is a single piece, multiple pieces, a focal point or an accentuation of the room's other features, it is important that you hang it in a way that stays in line with the room's size and layout. For example, a very high and narrow wall in a bathroom may be a good place to hang a vertical arrangement of three framed pictures, but not a good place to hang an over-sized, panoramic painting.

,


Hang art at eye level. If you are displaying art in a group, then the center-point of the group should be at eye level. To determine a relative eye level, measure between 60 inches (152.4 cm) and 66 inches (167.64 cm) up from the floor.
To display artwork at eye level in a sitting area, as in a dining room, hang the pieces at the eye level of the sitter.
If you are using artwork to frame an architectural element or a piece of furniture, you should hang wall art within 10 inches (25.4 cm) of the object.

, Use soft lighting sources, such as specially-designed wall art lighting fixtures, in order to diffuse spot lighting and reduce glare. Wall art lighting fixtures come in a variety of forms, such as recessed overhead lighting, track lighting and stick lighting that mounts directly to a picture frame.

Consider starting a collection first.,
Try different styles of drawing.,
Think about photography as an option and try shooting around with any camera you have available to you.,
Explore the world of painting.,
Consider sculpture.",How to Discover What Type of Artist You Are," It doesn't sound like much, but it can lead to all other forms of art. Start by collecting things that appeal to you visually. This can include stamps, business cards, trinkets, wrappers, and pictures. Collage them together so that they can be rearranged as you come up with new ways for each piece to fit. Try pinning them on a wall or bulletin board or arranging them on a table. When you want to try other forms of art just look at your collection. If you notice that you seem to have a lot of bright colors, maybe you will want to try painting or drawing with bright colors. If you notice that you have many people in your collage, then perhaps sculpting or portraits may interest you.;
, This could involve drawing an object several different ways: with pencil or with pen, by taking your time or by doodling it quickly, and by experimenting with colors and shades. Once you find a method you enjoy, stick with it to improve technique and work in new ideas to improve creativity.

, Experiment with layout and composition and with different subject matter, like landscapes or objects or people. Explore different color combinations or black-and-white settings, and if photography turns out to be your thing, consider upgrading to a camera with many variable options. Try out digital photo-manipulation if you want to add a little something more exotic than what you can find to shoot.

, Consider different ways to paint, including splatter paint, realistic painting, surreal art, and creating your own style. Sometimes painting can be quick, as when you are inspired, and other times it can be very time-consuming when your imagination is at a stand-still. White paint was invented for a reason - just consider it white out for an impressive essay; your brush is your pen to make it even more amazing.

, Experiment with different materials you can use - clay, wire, yarn, and various combinations. If you are carving something, be prepared to spend time and to make mistakes - after all, you are creating something 3-Dimensional. Sculpture can be one of the harder types of art to start with, especially if you are working with stone or marble.

Do your homework.,
Visit museums study the patinas.,
Look at the front and back of the piece.,
Look at the patina of the wood to determine whether the wood is old.,
Look for bristles.,
Use your nose.,
Decide about how the piece feels to you.,
Check for consistency.,
Get the work appraised.,
Note that some dealers, perhaps including those on cruise ships, may attempt to confuse the buyer with sizes and periods, even mediums to sell a lesser piece at inflated prices.,
Research the gallery.,
Beware of a scam where the print is not numbered but another document is, which is meaningless, as any signed in stone can be used in place of the real item.

",How to Determine if a Painting Is an Original or Reproduction," Research the piece, know the artist's work, look at many of his pieces, compare signatures, get close-ups of the signature. Increasing your knowledge is critical to examining the piece and knowing what to look for when judging authenticity.;
, If you ask to see the back of a painting, the staff may show you. Examine the feel and look of old art works. Study the depth and number of layers of paint needed to achieve the color desired by the artist.

,


Examine the patina of the piece itself: dirt and dust of the ages, texture, the brightness of colors, or lack thereof.
Study the canvas, do a thread count, modern or old?
Is there some patina on the back surface of the canvas?
Look for anachronisms. If the canvas is stapled on the back of a 1800's piece of art, something is wrong.

, Determine how the frame is put together, considering what kind of nails and hanger are used.

, Painted copies sometimes will have hairs from the cheap paint brush still in the paint on the canvas.

, When you do get your hands on the painting, smell it. It takes oil a while to dry and years to completely lose the smell of oil.

, Balance everything, many fakes for example have no depth of paint, layers, it's easy to copy a piece electronically but a photo copier cannot get the layers of paint a real piece has.

, A fake painted copy needs everything else to match, frame wise, and a patina is hard to reproduce.

, If it is something you are in love with, you need a third party to independently review it, someone who is not in love. How do you know if the appraiser is reliable? He or she should have a certificate from one or more of the professional associations of art appraisers, have a history of work with the particular artist or medium or period, and preferably not be a dealer or broker of art himself. One example is <a href=""http:Bernard Ewell</a>, who is an expert in Salvador Dali, whose prints are often copied. Research the market history of the artist. What have other works of this artist sold for at other auction houses, this size, time frame, and same medium?

, Look for signature and number. For prints they must be signed, and numbered.Signed in stone is of little interest, because unlimited copies can be drawn.

, Many pieces will have gallery stickers or information written on the back. Research that gallery to learn whether it is. Look for signs of wear. There should be some signs of wear, on the frame, even the canvas sometimes. Wooden edges not quite as sharp after 50, 100 years, and drier. Research the artist for reputation. Know that some artists are known to have signed blank paper, which later have prints drawn on/from them, which means the artist did not even supervise the pulls. These would be of significantly lesser value. Salvador Dali was know to have done this,

Draw inspiration for your designs.,
Sketch your designs.,
Add a border to the letter if you want.,
Finalize the design with ink or colors.",How to Illuminate a Letter2," Think of how you can illustrate your story, name, word, or individual letter purely with colors, images, and designs. Use the defining characteristics of a person, setting, or story to decorate your illuminated letter.


Try one of many traditional motifs for illuminated letters, which include birds and feathers; fruit and flowers; ribbons, vines, or rope; and Biblical motifs.If the themes of a text or your own interests or personality are more abstract, think of how they can be made into a symbol you can draw. For example, an image of weighted scales often represents justice, and a rose can symbolize romance., Use a pencil to sketch out the images you want to decorate your letter. Draw your designs inside or around letter, or even taking the shape of the letter itself.


Keep the drawing balanced with the shape of the letter by drawing a faint box in pencil around the outside of it as a guide for where decorative elements should end. Then erase the box, or build on it to create a decorative border for the letter if you wish.
Reach outside and overlap the lines of the letter with your designs to create a full and dynamic illustration.For example, you could decorate the letter “S” with a snake and create the illusion that the snake is coiled around the letter, or even that the snake makes up the letter with its own body.

, Create a border around your letter to add further decoration and a frame for your designs. Continue your design theme when decorating the border, or just create a simple frame to showcase your letter.


Try a traditional square shape for your border, or perhaps a circle or oval for a letter that features round elements.
Fill the space between your letter and the border with decoration, or with a solid color. Or leave it blank to add more contrast for your designs.

, Go over your pencil sketch with color when you’re happy with your designs. Use ink pens, markers, colored pencils, or paint to fill your letter with any colors you like.


Color in the elements of your design with a pigmented marker or ink pen, or try some shading with colored pencils or crayons by using three different shades (light, medium, dark) of the same hue to create depth.Add the characteristic gold or silver details that would have appeared in earlier centuries to highlight areas of your own drawing if you wish. Gold leaf would have been traditional, but you can also use inexpensive materials like gold or silver metallic markers, glitter, or paint."
"
Use a name or place.,
Take the first letter of a story.,
Try an illuminated alphabet.",How to Illuminate a Letter3," Decorate the first letter of your first or last name. Or, choose the name of a place that you care about, like your hometown or your favorite vacation spot.


Start thinking about how you might decorate an illuminated letter for your own name with things that interest you and colors you like. The first letter of a place name could feature landmarks or other images from that place.
You can also illuminate the first letter of a friend or family member’s name, and give your design to them as a nice gift.

, Use the first letter of a story you wrote, or one from your favorite book. Illuminate just the first letter on the first page, or one at the beginning of each chapter or section.


Think of the characters, images, or scenes contained in the story or chapter to start planning how you’ll decorate the first letter. Maybe animals, plants, landmarks, or weather will feature in your design. Or maybe you will only use abstract shapes and lines to illustrate the feeling of the story.
Instead of drawing a character in the story, think of you how you could draw the interests of that character or components of their life for your letter decoration.

, Decorate each letter of the alphabet as a fun way to create a unique design for each letter. This can also be a great way to practice making illuminated letters of all kinds.


Try creating each illuminated letter with images that begin with that letter. For instance, you could decorate the letter “A” with apples, alligators, and airplanes.
This can be a great project for teachers or parents of children beginning to learn their letters and words.

Do not put the artwork near severe temperature fluctuations.,
Select a frame that complements not just the painting but also the décor of the room where it is placed.,
Have an indirect light source highlight the artworks, in the form of recessed lighting or spotlights in false ceilings.",How to Display Art2,"


Place paintings on a wall that is a dividing wall within your home rather than on the perimeter. The simple reason is that the perimeter walls are more subject to temperature fluctuations and also the possibility of water seepage. These could result in fading of pigments, cracks forming in the canvas and increased yellowing of the varnish. If you would still need to display the painting on the perimeter wall then it would be prudent to place rubber or plastic behind the frame so that the work is not in direct contact with the wall.
Displaying a painting above a fireplace will expose it to extremes in temperature and soot and is a strict no, no. The same applies to having the painting above heating and air conditioning vents. Avoid areas of high humidity like the bathroom. The kitchen is another room which should not host artworks, the steam and fumes of cooking are bound to ruin the colours over time.

, Normally smaller paintings need to be displayed with a mount. If you have a large wall, a museum style framing would help cover a larger area. A dark frame is normally advised for smaller works which help to bring the artwork into focus. For larger canvas works, keeping them on the stretcher would suffice, but they need to be checked regularly for signs of moisture or dust.

, It’s a known fact that direct lighting can harm the paintings and cause the colours to fade. While the commonly used ‘picture’ lamps are popular, they cast a harsh glare which heats the painting unevenly. While using halogen lamps be aware that these emit a high level of ultraviolet light which damages artworks and hence should be installed with a UV filter. If the option is available, use tungsten lamps instead.

Choose an appropriate space.,
Group items according to size, color, subject and theme.,
Think creatively about display areas.,
Draw attention to freestanding art with lighting.,
Place a sculpture so that it can be viewed from all four sides, so the placement should be such that gives an unrestricted view of the work.",How to Display Art3," Display artwork in an area that is proportional size-wise to the art piece, and that is relevant to the art's purpose. For example, if you want a large statue to be the focal point of a room, then you should place it in an area that is visible from the room's entry points and be careful not to overcrowd the piece with the room's architecture.

, Randomize the arrangement height and width-wise, so as to create visual interest. Assemble objects in a way that makes sense logically, such as grouping 3 Indian artifacts or arranging a row of ceramic pottery.

, There are many places you may choose to display freestanding art, including pedestals, tabletops, shelves, fireplace mantels, the floor, display boxes, easels and cabinets.

, Overhead spot lighting, unidirectional track lighting and ambient lighting are good choices for highlighting art pieces in a space.

,


For large sculptures place them in the centre of a room allowing observers to move around it. If the sculpture is made of material that is weather resistant like bronze then you could consider placing it in the garden.
Smaller works should be displayed at eye level and hence a pedestal is advisable.
When deciding lighting for the sculpture, play around with the lights and see which effect suits you best. The play of light and shadows over a sculpture greatly enhances the way it appears. Experiment with direct overhead light or a side light source for a dramatic effect.

Select a variety of sizes.,
Incorporate various orientations and shapes.,
Pick different mediums of art.,
Keep your color palette consistent.,
Choose the right frames.",How to Create a Gallery Wall1," Make sure to use big, medium, and small pieces when choosing the artwork for your gallery wall. The bigger pieces will act as an anchor, bringing the composition together. The smaller pieces will be used to fill in the space around the centerpiece., To balance the composition, you need both vertical and horizontal pieces. Also, in addition to rectangular pieces, try to have square-shaped pieces (and even oval-shaped pieces) of art to create a balanced composition.Don’t skip oddly shaped pieces. Oddly shaped pieces can add an interesting element to your composition.

, Using different mediums will elevate your gallery wall to the next level. Choose from abstract paintings, photography, drawings, oil paintings, prints, and/or collages, to name a few.You can even create a theme by choosing three or four different mediums that complement each other like photography, drawings, and prints, for example.

, Pick artwork whose colors compliment each other like gold, beige, pink, and red, for example. This will help bring the composition together once it is finished.Keeping your color palette consistent will also make framing your artwork easier.

, Make sure your frames complement the color palette of your art pieces. Your frames should also be cohesive—they should all fall in the same color range or contrast each other.For example, white, beige, and light pink frames, or contrasting black and white frames.

Measure the wall space you want to fill.,
Anchor the composition with one big piece.,
Fill in the space around the centered pieces.,
Experiment with different arrangements.",How to Create a Gallery Wall2," Use a measuring tape to do this. Then mark these parameters on the floor using painter’s tape. You could also use yardsticks or other found objects to mark the parameters on the floor., If you do not have one large piece, then combine two or three medium sized pieces that complement each other. Place the large piece(s) slightly off-center, i.e., 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) off-center., Starting from the center and moving outward, place the smaller pieces of art around the larger, centered piece(s). Space the pieces at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) apart, but not more than 7 inches (17.8 cm).Make sure to space out large pieces.
Try pairing pieces together based on color, for example.

, Lay out your pieces of art in at least three different arrangements. Take a picture of each arrangement. Then go back to compare and contrast the arrangements and pick your favorite one."
"
Cut out templates from craft paper.,
Tape the templates to the wall.,
Mark where the nails should go.,
Hammer in your nails.,
Hang your art.",How to Create a Gallery Wall3," Lay out craft paper on the floor. Place each piece on the paper and cut out a template. Make sure to trim the paper to the size of the art piece when it is framed., Tape your templates using painter’s tape. Start with the centerpiece and place it at eye level, i.e., about 57 inches (144.8 cm) from the floor. Then arrange the rest of the pieces around it in the exact way that you want them. Step back and see if:The space is filled appropriately.
The arrangement is too close or too far from nearby furniture.
Play with the arrangement until you are happy with it.

, With a pencil or pen, place a dot on the craft paper where the frame’s hanging attachment is. This is where you will hammer in your nails., Do this with the paper still on the wall. After you have hammered in all of your nails, un-tape the paper and tear it away from the nail. Make sure to use weight-appropriate nails.Use monkey-hook picture hangers for art up to 35 pounds (560 ounces), i.e., lightweight art.
Use nails or hollow-wall hangers for art up to 79 pounds (1,264 ounces).
Use wall anchors for art up to 143 pounds (2,288 ounces).

, Start by hanging the centerpiece(s) first. Use a leveler to make sure each piece is straight. Then step back from the wall and assess it one more time. Make sure the paintings are level and the arrangement is cohesive."

Figure out how many people will be there.,
Think of a theme.,
Decide how many movies will you be watching.,
Plan your start time.,
Cover the munchies.,
Consider providing a real meal.,
Make sure wherever you are having the marathon has enough room.,
Make it a night to remember.",How to Plan a Movie Marathon," It could be a party type or just for you. If you want a big crowd, be sure to plan ahead and invite them!;
, Some popular themes are chick flicks, horror films, or comedy. If you don't want to stick to one genre, you can just marathon your favorite movies.

, At least two movies are needed or else it won't really be a marathon. A good amount would be about four or five, but you can watch more for an extended marathon. A true movie marathon means watching 26.2 hours of movies, just as a marathon race is 26.2 miles (42.2 km).

, It depends on how long you want to stay up and how many movies you have to watch. Most movies won't be much longer than two hours, but make sure you know how long each movie will take. So if you are watching five movies starting at nine p.m, it would be too late unless you want to pull an all-nighter.

, No movie marathon is complete without them. Popcorn cannot be ignored. Be sure to buy one or two boxes before the marathon begins. If any of your friends have a sweet tooth, get some candy like M&Ms. Common drinks to have at a marathon are of course soda and juice. Try to stock up on them before the marathon. Alcohol may add an element of fun to the marathon if you are all of the legal drinking age, and the movies are on the light-hearted side.

, If your marathon will last more than 6 hours, your guests may get tired of snack foods and expect a real meal. Determine how you will feed them. Should everyone pitch in for pizza? Or will you take a break halfway through the marathon to grill up some burgers?

, Bring down extra pillows and blankets to make it comfortable.

, Dim the lights and close the curtains for a real ""movie theater"" effect. In the breaks, put on some music and socialize, try to bring a mix of friends so your friends can meet other friends of yours.

Select the movies according to age and interest.,
Ask your children if there are specific movies they'd like to watch.,
Write down the movies suggested.,
Prepare the movie area.,
Place plenty of comfortable items in the room.,
Prepare some snacks.,
Have the children choose the movies.,
Ask the children if they are comfortable and if they have everything they want or need.,
Insert the movie.,
When the first movie is done, repeat and enjoy until bedtime or home time.

",How to Plan a Kids Movie Night," The movies should be age-appropriate and focus on subject matter that the children will like. Ask the child or children what kind of genres they enjoy. If they choose ghost stories, drama or action stories, then find movies that match the genre.;
, Get some suggestions from your own kids rather than chasing around after everyone else who will be coming. While there is a risk that some kids will have already seen the movies, if you get a bunch of movies for the kids to choose from, they'll come to their own arrangements about what they're happy to watch, either for the first time or again.


Ask about two nights ahead of the movie night. This will give you plenty of time to decide which movies are appropriate and to get hold of them.

, Head down to the DVD store to borrow the DVDs directly. Alternatively, rent the movies through your online provider or TV services provider, making payment, etc. as required by that service.


If the movie night is a long one, get at least two different movies, and preferably a few more, so that there is some choice. For a single movie, make an informed choice based on asking your own kids and get only one or two choices so that there isn't fussing all night about the movies that were missed out on.

, Clear away unnecessary furniture and anything the kids might try to bounce off or could potentially break or hurt themselves on. The less stuff in the room or space, the better.


Assign at least one of the children to help clean up the area. Assign another to kitchen duty, such as bringing food in on a tray, etc.)
Have someone be responsible for checking that the DVD player, etc. is in good working order. If using home DVDs, have this person check that the DVDs are clean and playable.
If ordering food for the party, do this ahead of time.

, This might include beanbags or large floor cushions. It should also include small cushions, pillows and blankets for the kids to arrange however they wish.

, Don't go overboard here, as kids will keep eating if there is a lot of food and they don't need it. However, a few nice snacks will go down a treat. Provide small bowls of a few candies, some fruit slices, nuts if nobody is allergic, popcorn and home baked cookies. You'll also need some drinks. Ensure easy access to water (as much as they want) and maybe one or two small glasses of juice or soda.


If the kids are also eating over, pizza, hot dogs, hamburgers, etc. make easy choices and can be made healthily or vegetarian if needed.
Keep sugary snack servings small.

, Show them the pile of movies they have to choose from and ask them to choose together what they want to watch. Stay around to monitor the voting process, to avoid any upsets.


If consensus cannot be reached, suggest that the kids vote. Whichever movie gets the most votes is the movie that is watched first, and so on.

, Let newcomers know where the bathroom is, and provide flashlights if the lights are to be dimmed and the switches hard to find.

, Let the kids start watching it, then you can tiptoe away and relax in another room.


It's a good idea to remain within earshot. Complaints about anything can escalate quickly when kids get tired, and adult intervention may be needed.

, It's often easier to start from the end and work your way back. Some ways to create a story:


Merge two genres together(Quentin Tarantino's death proof slasher and car movie)
Make a list of cool things you have or can get a hold of and base your story around those items.
Get ideas from other movies. For example: asking the question, ""What destroyed the world in Wall-E? Was it a war, energy shortage, or some other disaster?""

, Your characters will shape the story and motivate scenes. You can base characters on people you know or people you meet. Understanding personality types and personality factors will help you make deeper and more believable characters. Write a full-page bio for each of your characters: where they come from, everything about their life, and their personality.

, Write down every scene you can think of in detail on individual cards, and don't worry about if they fit together yet. Make sure every scene you have is motivated by your characters and your underlying story. Once you have a good selection go through and pick the best ones.

, Go through your scenes and make sure each scene leads into the next. Outline everything that happens as if it was the table of contents in a book. Make sure everything you have is necessary to the story, and edit out anything that isn't.

, You can find script-writing How-To's on this website.

, Storyboard out all your camera shots so you know what you're working with and you're ready to go the day of the shoot. There is software to help you with this like FrameForge 3D Studio.

, You need a camera preferably with 24P(movie standard) and a shallow depth of field. A boom pole and shotgun mic will improve your sound and make your film seem more professional.

, Most people won't mind you shooting at their home or business as long as you don't damage anything. They may require you to sign a waiver of liability, so keep some handy.

, See other How-To articles on this website.

, Three point lighting is the most used lighting technique for film. You can use a white poster board to bounce light on the shadow side of the face.

, Every room has a unique sound and you need it for when you edit the sounds in post-production.

, To direct an actor you need to say things that will bring out an emotion, like, ""play the scene as if you had just found out your dog has been involved in an accident."" Do not just give an actor instructions such as, ""be angrier,"" as this is not very clear and leaves a lot up to interpretation.

, It is common to start with the master shot to give your actors more freedom of movement, then whenever you move in for closer shots you put the camera where will cover all the action. Make sure the actor follows the same path and movement every time.

, Make sure when you shoot a scene all movements, clothing, props and everything else are the same and in the same place, so that when you edit everything matches up.

, You can find articles on editing on this site. You can find editing software here

,, Sound editing should help tell the story. You should have sound effects for doors opening, walking and anything else, you can record all your sound effects with your microphone. After getting the sound how you like it you can use the sound you retorted on your set to blend it together.

, You need a press kit to send to film festivals. Here is an example.

Come up with a simple, filmable idea.,
Write out a basic script.,
Round up your equipment.,
Experiment with your camera until you know every feature.",How to Make a Movie With One Person1," Making a movie by yourself means you'll have to strip away any other actors or any scenes that need multiple people to run. This eliminates most special effects and dialog, unfortunately. But these limitations can be liberating, leading to unique and creative workarounds. Some ideas to consider filming are:



Art Films: Pioneers like Sadie Benning and Bruce Nauman have made huge contributions to the art world with nothing by a camera and a willingness to experiment. You can do anything from video diaries to abstract videos exploring color or sound. Check out the free Video Data Bank for inspiration.

Short Documentaries: All you need is a camera and a microphone and you can be on the street interviewing and grabbing footage.

Talking Heads: Popular on YouTube and in shows like The Office, this is just you talking to your camera, delivering a monologue or performing a sketch. Sometimes this video is set next to a movie or game you are commenting on.

Stop-motion: Though time consuming, stop-motion is one of the few places a filmmaker can make a professional-looking film all by themselves.;
, It doesn't need to cover the entire story if you are working with a loose idea, but having some ideas of paper will guide you when filming starts. Almost all videos tell a story, in some way shape or form, and almost all stories are broken into three parts:



The Beginning: Set up the world of your video. It can be you, the character, the location you're shooting on, or simply a color or mood you want to explore.

The Conflict: Something disturbs, changes, or morphs the original set-up. For art films or smaller pieces, this might just be a change of pace or the introduction of a new theme. The ""story"" is told through this change.

The Resolution: How does your story end, what is your message or thought? Some stories just end, but this just implies that nothing has changed in the end., All you need is a camera and a way to edit the footage on a computer, but there is additional equipment that will help build a movie by yourself as well:



A Tripod: If you want to film yourself in a scene, a tripod is the best way to get a steady camera that can be moved, spun, and raised/lowered into a variety of angles.

Lighting: One of the key differences between amateur-looking movies and professional ones is good lighting. Even 3-4 clamp lights bought at Home Depot can be enough to get strong, consistent lighting in your movie.

, If you're making a movie on your own you want as many tricks up your sleeve as possible. Your camera is your best friend, and knowing how to manipulate it will be a big part of making your movie unique and original. The best way to learn is to play, but some things you need to look out for include:



White Balance: This changes the ""temperature"" of your film, or the coloring. A properly set white balance ensures that all of your colors look natural. While you can play with white balance to get different visual effects, this is often easier while editing.

Lenses: Different lenses will profoundly change your shot composition. Play with wide angles, fish eyes, and macro lenses to change up your visuals.

Focus: Focusing takes a lifetime to master, and you should start now. Focus dictates what part of the shot is clear and which is blurry. Many cameras have automatic focus, but to make great films you need to manually control the focus."

Watch with friends.,
Watch in a well-lit, comfortable place.,
Get a blanket or hoodie.,
Read about the movie.",How to Not Be Scared During a Movie1," Make sure you are watching a scary movie with other people close by you. Invite more friends, family, or even pets if you’re watching the movie at home.Talk to friends about the movie and whether or not they think they’ll get scared. It can help to know that most people get scared by horror movies, whether they admit it or not, because that’s the purpose of scary movies!
If you’re watching in a movie theater, make sure you have people you know on either side of you, if possible, without empty seats, strangers, or an aisle next to you which could make you feel less comfortable.
You can even ask a friend if they’re okay with you squeezing their hand or getting closer to them during scary parts. Most people are happy to help you feel at ease!;
, See a movie in a room with the lights on, if possible. Get comfortable on a couch, chair, or the floor so you feel more safe.


Avoid watching the movie while it’s dark outside, or when you have to go to sleep directly afterwards. Watch a DVD during the day, or catch a matinee at a theater.
You can even encourage watching a movie in a room of the house where other things are going on around you. This might help to distract you and remind you of reality during the movie.

, Wear a comfortable hoodie sweatshirt or other item of clothing that makes you feel warm and secure. Wrap yourself in a blanket if you want, or hug a pillow to your chest.


Wear a hoodie to a movie theater as a way to stay warm in the typically cold space, stay comfortable, and even hide your face with the hood if you want to.
Share a blanket with a friend to help you feel close to someone and be extra warm. Warmth and comfort will help the shivers or vulnerable feeling you get when you’re scared.

, Get familiar with the movie you’re watching before you see it in the theater or in someone’s home. Knowing more about what will happen in the plot will help you be less surprised by the scary parts.


Watch a trailer, and any other available scenes from the movie you can find online. You will already be prepared for the scary visuals that they often show in the trailers if you watch them beforehand.
You can even listen to the soundtrack beforehand if it’s available online. Do a happy, simple activity during the day while you listen to it and it won’t seem threatening. The soundtrack often makes scary parts of the movie much scarier, but not if you take the fear out of the music ahead of time.
If you’ve already seen the movie, you can still refresh your memory by reading or watching content related to it, or just know that you will likely be less scared by something you’ve already seen.

Focus on telling your story or idea visually.,
Make a storyboard of your film.,
Use an external mic instead of the camera microphone.,
Shoot in short bursts, not long single takes, when getting lots of footage.,
Stay in one place if you are filming yourself.,
Get 3-5 times the footage you think you need.",How to Make a Movie With One Person2," Video is a visual medium, and while voice overs and text are great to get information across they are not incredibly compelling. If you're shooting alone you will not be able to use dialog, actors, or a ton of sound to tell your story. What you have, however, is all the time in the world to set up great shots, capture good video, and work on creating compelling angles.


Have the mind of a photographer on every shot. Ask yourself if, on its own, the image is interesting.

, A storyboard is just the comic book version of your movie. They are invaluable ways to design your film, allowing you to ""see"" the movie before shooting. It then acts as your guidebook to the film. You can find and print templates online, or simply draw out your basic shots in advance with pen and paper.


Improvising for the camera has it's place, of course. But storyboards are a good way to plan where the camera should go.

, Camera microphones are notoriously bad, and they become useless when the camera is far away from the action. An external microphone will make a huge difference in your production quality, since most audiences notice bad sound before rough video., Make discrete, compelling ""scenes"" instead of turning the camera on and letting it run while you move around. This ensures that you think about each scene individually and it makes editing much easier., Focus works by sharpening the image at one particularly distance from the camera. If you move around the camera will struggle to keep up, shifting focus or becoming blurry.


Put down a small piece of tape that tells you where you need to sit or stand for each take., Films of any lengths are built in the editing booth.The more raw material, or film, that you have to work with the happier you will be, and the easier it will be to make a great movie. Grab different angles of the same shot, run through different lines, or videotape your environment for atmospheric shots. Every extra shot counts.Experiment with shots. Take crazy angles, get weird, abstract shots of everyday objects, and really explore your area with the camera. You may not use the footage, but even grabbing one compelling shot out of 100 will be worth it.

Edit your movie to tell your story or idea, not to be flashy.,
Learn to use cuts to tell your story.,
Think about the rhythm and pacing of your scenes.,
Take the time to color correct your footage.,
Watch your film with friends and ask for their opinions.",How to Make a Movie With One Person3," Editing is one of the most underrated art forms in cinema, but that is almost by design. The best editors are invisible, making their cuts and changes perfectly. As a result, the audience, never has to think about editing. The footage just flows together. When you start editing your movie, make sure you know what the story, point, or thesis of your film is. All of your editing needs to service this idea., Editing version of paint and brushes is the ""cut,"" which is simply when you transition from one shot to another. This is how films tell stories -- the images cut from one to the other, and each cut shows the audience a slight change or progression, like ""she enters the building,"" or ""he is talking now."" They can be simple or symbolic, such as Stanley Kubrick's famous cut from a tossed bone to a space station in 2001: A Space Odyssey. Knowing how to use cuts to tell your story is vital to film editing.Hard Cut-- a cut to another angle or shot with no transitions. This is the most common cut in film.

Smash Cut- An abrupt shift to completely different scene/image. This calls attention to the cut, often signalling a surprise or big shift in the story.

Jump Cut-- An abrupt cut made within the same scene, usually to a slightly different angle. Though uncommon, they show confusion or the passing of time.

J-Cut-- Cutting to the audio of the next shot, but not the video. This is a great way to link two scenes thematically, or provide narration.

L-Cut-- Cutting to the video of the next shot, but still playing the audio from the old scene. This is a great way to show a character talking about something, like a promise, then doing it (or breaking it).

Action Cut-- A cut in the middle of some movement. For example, showing a door opening on one room then cutting as it opens to a shot of the same door opening from the other side.

Superimposition: When two different videos layer on top of each other, implying that they are connected and intertwined. This is often used in transitions, too.Matching Shots: When the shape of one video is mimicked in the next. For example, you might have a shot of your eyes, then cut to your eyes in sunglasses or someone else's eyes. This links the shots, but usually hints at some fundamental difference as well.

, Many editors think in terms of individual frames -- the still shots you see if you pause the screen -- and compile them like musicians use notes.How does your movie flow? How does the speed of the cuts contribute to the pacing of the video? In general:


Quick cuts give a scene high energy and propulsive movement.
Slow, infrequent cuts build tension, suspense, and focus. They slow the movie down, allowing the to viewer contemplate a shot or idea.
It takes a human brain 3-5 frames to recognize an image. So you may confuse the audience if you try to be too rapid. This, however, could also be the goal., Color correction is the process of adjusting hue, saturation, brightness, and contrast of each video so that they all look the same. It is hard to get this right by yourself while shooting, so basic color correction while editing is almost always necessary. All video editing software has filters and effects for color correction. Many programs also have automatic correction, but it is often hit or miss.


You can also play with color correction to get surprising effects or specialty lighting, like soft yellow glows or dangerous, intense red tints.
If you are looking to submit your film to festivals or events, consider paying for professional color grading., The only way to become a better filmmaker is to share your film with the world. Ask them, in their own words, to explain what they thought happened and comment on what they do and don't like. Brainstorm ways that you could improve it together and try incorporate their suggestions into your next film. Who knows -- maybe they'll help you make it.

Close your eyes during scary parts.,
Cover your ears to block out the soundtrack.,
Make an exit when you can.,
Eat something or have something to distract yourself with.",How to Not Be Scared During a Movie2," Simply block out the visuals of the movie when you anticipate a scary part coming. You can simply close your eyes or cover them with your hand, hat, hood, or a blanket.


If you want to be subtle, try feigning a slow blink, for which you just close your eyes for a few seconds at a time. You can also block your eyes with a low hood or hat to appear like you’re still watching when you’re really not.Pay attention to the cues that the movie gives you to indicate that a big scare, called a jump scare, is coming. Listen for ominous music or look for when a protagonist is alone or in the dark, seemingly safe for the moment., Block out the sound of the soundtrack to make the visuals of the movie a little less scary. Often the music is what makes a scary scene more of a dramatic surprise.


Plug your ears with your fingers at the moment you anticipate a scary part. Remember to listen for the music starting to get creepy, but you can block out the sound once you anticipate it starting to build to a big scare.
If you don’t want those around you to know that you’re blocking the sound out, try wearing earbud headphones or earplugs throughout the movie. You can hide them with your hair, a hat, or a hood. Just remember that this can block all the sound around you, and you may not hear your friends if they try to talk to you.

, Tell your friends or family a simple excuse to leave the room or theater when you anticipate a scary part coming up. Get up to use the bathroom or get a snack, for example.


Make sure you don’t use the same excuse too many times during the movie, or be gone for too long at a time. Actually bring back a snack if you say you’re going to get one; do your best to make it realistic.
You can even look up online databases that tell you at what point in the movie a jump scare will come, so you know exactly when to make your exit., Have a snack, drink, or chew gum to keep yourself occupied and keep your jaw relaxed. Play with something small in your hands to keep them occupied as well.


You can try squeezing a stress ball, fiddling with a small toy or item, or something else that helps you release some of your nervous energy while you remain mostly still.
Distract yourself further by talking and laughing with your friends during the movie, if they’re okay with doing so. It can really help to realize the silly or ridiculous parts of the movie, or simply remind yourself that your friends are real and the movie is fake.

"
"
Think about how the movie was made.,
Find elements to laugh at.,
Think about other things.",How to Not Be Scared During a Movie3," Picture all of the people and parts that go into making the movie that you can’t see on screen. Remind yourself that the whole world of the move isn’t real and is just an elaborate construction of the cast and crew.


Picture the director yelling out orders behind the camera, all the other people controlling lights, sound, and props on the set, and the actors messing up and laughing between takes.
Ask yourself questions like “How did they do that makeup?” or “I wonder how long it took to get that scene right?”

, Pay attention to the moments or elements in a scene that make it apparent that the movie is fake, ridiculous, or even poorly made. This can help turn scary moments into funny ones.


Look for clearly fake effects, like overly-bright blood, bad makeup, and computer-generated graphics. Or keep your eye out for continuity errors or other mistakes in filming, like when something appears in one take but suddenly disappears in the next.
Even if the movie is well-made, you can laugh at the overly common themes or ideas that appear in most horror movies, like the “Don’t go in there!” moments where a protagonist always enters a room with the enemy or monster.

, Distract yourself with other thoughts, or even talk to someone about something other than the movie if you can. Keep your thoughts pleasant and focused on the real world.


Focus on simple things, like recalling what you had for breakfast that morning, counting numbers, or going through some other sequence that’s meaningless and has nothing to do with the themes of the movie.
Think about what you’ll do after the movie. You can plan to reward yourself for getting through the scary movie with something fun and enjoyable afterwards.

Before people arrive, plan what to watch, or at least have it narrowed down to a few options. This will save time and make the night more enjoyable.If you have a specific movie that you want to show, it’s good to tell people when you invite them what movie you’ll be watching. This way they already know what to expect when they show up.;
, If you love movies, you most likely have a few that you know other people have missed out on. Take this chance to show your friends how great it is. You may have to check ahead of time and ask if they have seen it, so have a few in mind in case your first choice doesn’t work out.You still want to make sure the movie is something that people will enjoy. If your favorite film is a silent German art piece, maybe your friends are not into that. Find the balance between something that’s underrated and something none of your friends want to see.
With this option, you’ll probably have to tell them ahead of time what movie you’re picking, or you might end up with something they’ve all seen.

, You want everyone to be on board with the movie choice as much as possible. Give everyone the options ahead of time and let them vote on what they want. Or have them submit a choice to you and use those as the voting options.


You are still the host, so you have the final say in what to watch. Give people the chance for input as much as you can, but set a cut off point when you’ll make the final decision.

, If you’ll be hosting all guys or all girls, consider what they’ll enjoy most. If kids will be present, make sure the movie is appropriate. Try to pick a movie that fits your common interest, which might be sports (Remember the Titans), music (Begin Again), business (The Big Short), or martial arts (The Raid: Redemption).Picking something you’ve never seen is great when you’re alone, but it may not be the best plan for inviting people. You might end up with something you don’t even like.
If you don’t know what type of movies people like, this is when it’s good to gather their input ahead of time.

, When you have time for multiple movies, pick a fun set of sequels, movies with the same leading actor, or movies with similar content. Watch your favorite actor across multiple decades, or let a few people showcase their favorite old sci-fi movie.The combinations you come up with are endless. You might even choose a set of movies where the theme isn’t obvious and the audience has to figure out the connection by the end of the last movie.
The connection can be as specific or general as you want. You might watch two different version of the King Kong story, or you might pick two movies that were simply released in the same year. You can find some connection between most movies if you try hard enough.

, To make the night a big event, you could design tickets that feature the date of the movie night, the title of the movie, and the person’s name who you are inviting. This will raise your movie night above hanging out and make it into a special occasion.You can mail them out ahead of time to invite people, or you can hand them out in person as you see people.
Just to make it fun, tell everyone that they must have their ticket to be able to enter the movie showing. But let them in even if they forget the ticket!

, Rather than sticking to the living room, find a creative location to watch the movie. Moving outdoors can be a fun option. Scary movies are great in the basement or attic. You could set up in the garage for racing movies or a bedroom for romantic movies.


The location you choose should relate to the movie in some way, or it probably isn’t worth the trouble of setting it up. Watching Interstellar under the stars would be amazing, but watching Training Day in the bedroom probably wouldn’t have much effect.
Make sure the location you choose is good and comfortable for movie watching. You don’t want to get attacked by bugs outside or freeze in an unheated garage. Make the proper adjustments when moving to these locations.

, Depending on the size of the room where you’ll show the movie, you will most likely need to bring in some extra folding chairs, pillows and blankets for those sitting on the floor, or even move in a couch from another room.It’s best to have all of this done before people arrive so that no one feels like you are going to a lot of trouble for them. You’ll need an idea of how many people are coming so you can set up the seating accurately.
Check all of the seating to make sure that people will be able to see the tv (or projector screen). Sit in all of the spots to make sure the view is good.
If you only have a small amount of room to work with, make sure you don’t invite so many people that it begins to feel cramped.

, Movies and snacking go hand in hand, so make sure you have a great spread. You could ask people to bring something or provide it all yourself. Make sure you have plates and napkins to keep the mess to a minimum. Check with all of your guests about any food allergies or diet restrictions beforehand.Classic movie snacks like popcorn, candy, and soda are always good options. But you could also have more filling foods like a sandwich bar, french fries, or meatballs. Include some healthy options like fruit, vegetables, and cheese.
It’s good to have a wide range of drinks such as soda, juice, water, and alcohol (if the party is just for adults).
Make sure you have a trash can set out in plain sight so people can throw their trash away.
Another way to make things fun is to have snacks that go along with the movie. Donuts for a cop movie, fish sticks for an ocean adventure, or even something fancy for a cooking movie.

, You could decorate to the theme of the movie by using Halloween stuff for scary movies, jerseys and pennants for sports movies, or props and characters from the movie itself. You can put out some simple decorations or give the viewing room a whole makeover.


You could lay out a red carpet and set up a marquee like it’s a big movie premiere.
If you want to go more elaborate, you could stage the room to look like the main set of the movie or a significant scene.
Any amount of decorating that makes it look like more than your living room will give the evening a special feel.

, Watching with all the lights on may make moving around easier, but watching in a darkened room creates the best ambiance. If shutting all the lights off makes it too dark, consider setting up a few dim lamps, or string Christmas lights around the room.


If you’ll watch in a room that has lights on a dimmer switch, this is perfect because you can dim them right as the movie starts.

, Movie nights are meant to be fun, so don’t get carried away with enforcing rules, but ask everyone at the start to keep their phones put away. It’s usually more fun to all be focused on the movie together rather than everyone looking at their phones.Announce this at the start of the movie, but don’t make it sound like you are trying to be strict. Just say it will be more fun for everyone if there are no phones out distracting people from the movie.

, You can plan ahead of time to take an intermission halfway through, like old movies or plays. This gives everyone time to check their phones for anything important, use the bathroom, and load up on another round of snacks.


Keep the intermission to a time limit so that it doesn’t stretch on too long. 10 minutes is probably sufficient for people to move around and take care of their business.

, People who love movies usually love to sit and discuss them after they watch. You could plan some specific questions ahead of time, or just let things go with the flow. Since you are the host, you should open the discussion to get people engaged.


For example, you could ask people what they thought of the protagonist? Was he or she likeable or annoying?
You could ask if anyone picked out a certain theme the filmmakers were trying to establish throughout the movie.

Stick to the story, to what's happening on each frame.

,
Stick to the feeling of the film.,
Do not ask Feedback.,
Immerse yourself.",How to Compose Music for Film," Start by watching the film once, to discover the story, then watch it again, and you start seeing different things, and getting into the rhythm of the film, the video editing, other details, the climax (a bit like a symphony).;
, Have it play in the background while you're doing other things (working on the computer, doing emails etc). Your brain will still get used to it more, it's far more efficient than we think.

, Play it again now and mute the sound completely: another dimension will be revealed. It may talk to you more than with the sound actually. You will get to see more details as well, or notice other things, if it's very still, or very fast. The style of filming and video editing will stand out more. Your brain will not be distracted by the sound (and our ears are far more sensitive than our eyes), so it frees some space for your mind to focus on the images.

, The instruments are chosen depending on the atmosphere. It might be instruments you've never used before. At this point, the video will dictate to you what it needs, hopefully.

, The video editing may be fast, slow, make sure you understand the ""beat"" of the film. It may vary a lot on  the rhythm, and speed, kept changing throughout the video, and it's important to adapt to it.

,, Composing music for film is about emotion. Make sure you really understand the emotion the producer is trying to emulate and stick to it. This emotion may vary from one second to another. There are hundreds of emotion people go through everyday, so make sure your music invokes the right feeling - and make sure it succeeds to emulate that feeling (even if you listen to without listening to the images).

, Feedback is a double edge sword. If you're really into your creation process, somebody's feedback might be helpful or not. You have to be confident enough to know exactly where you're going in terms of intention and emotion, even though you don't really have a clue what instruments will take you there. You can choose to compose surrounded by people, or really remotely. Both can be helpful.

, Let the film take over. Like an actor suddenly becomes his role, and lives, breathes, eats, sleeps and talks like his character. The images will inspire you to do the rest.

Include back-end compensation for the author in the agreement.,
Determine the amount of any royalties you’ll pay to the writer for subsequent productions.,
Include reserved rights in the agreement.,
Sign the option agreement along with the writer and pay the agreed option price.",How to Buy Movie Rights1," Entertainment lawyers specialize in the legal aspects of the entertainment industry, including optioning film rights. Since they are so well-versed with the process, they are invaluable to those seeking to purchase the film rights to an established work., This is the preferred method because you don't pay as much up front. The option requires you as the potential buyer to pay the author an amount of money for the option to purchase the film rights. The contract typically lasts for a specific period of time, during which you may try to get everything together to execute the production of the film. Once you are ready to produce the film, you will then exercise your option to purchase film rights.If the option deal doesn’t go through, the author may, depending on the agreement, retain the initial payment amount and any renewal amounts received from the buyer and still keep the movie rights with the ability to sell them elsewhere.

, This time frame can vary and can include extensions on the initial period of time that often require another payment to the author. Often, the option period will last 6-12 months. Extensions may last 3-6 months. You may also ask to renegotiate the option instead of ask for further extensions., You’ll have an initial payment, which may be a percentage of the total purchase price, and the amount you’ll pay for any extensions included in the agreement. The initial payment may very likely go toward the purchase of the film rights once you take the option to buy them, but extension payments may not.Maximum percentage-based initial payments usually fall within 2.5 to 5 percent of the purchase price.

, The author may want a small percentage of the proceeds of the film to go to them, should you go through with the purchase and produce the film. This is generally a small percentage of those proceeds and can be negotiated prior to signing the agreement., These productions might include sequels, prequels, or even television series that are based on the original literary work or first film adaption of the work. There are some industry-specific figures for these royalties, including a royalty of 1/3 the purchase price paid for the rights of the original work per remake, etc. Television films and series may have different, yet negotiable royalty shares., You should make clear the rights the author reserves in the option agreement. These may include publication rights, the right to publish sequels, prequels, or other canonical works, or other rights. If the author has particular rights that he or she wants to reserve for him or herself, be sure to include them in the option agreement., You may need a lawyer to assist you in the signing because the agreement will be written using specialized legal verbiage.After signing the agreement, pay the writer the option price.

Weather.",How to Develop Characters in Film4," Where would your character live or act?

Or do you want to go against conventions and show them living happily with a family or give them a sense of humour that appeals to the viewer.

, Use props to externalize how the character is feeling.

, If it's a softer, kinder character who is much less concerned about how he or she looks than other aspects of life, use very little makeup in flesh-colored or very light tones. If your character is extremely outgoing and likes to stand out in the crowd, try bolder colors, especially on the lips our around the eyes.

Plus, as a director or casting artist, you should know things about characters that aren't necessarily incorporated in the film, such as their heritage, families, previous boyfriends/girlfriends and personal experiences. Sit down with your actors and tell them these things so that they can grasp the technique of embodying your character as well as they can.

, They should always be focusing on the most vital part of the shot, but it's very good development if an actor or actress is deep in emotion during the scene to always get a good look at his or her face. Remember that it's okay to cut the scene and tell your actors to change something or do something else, or that during editing you can always look at camera angles and focus on different points in the shot.

, Ask them what they know about the characters once it is over. The more detail the give you, the better. Also, ask them questions that can't be answered just by watching the film, such as ""How many ex-boyfriends do you think she has?"" Or ""What do you think his mother was like?"" To see if they understood underlying emotions in the script and acting.

You may end up having to shell out a little bit of money for the movie, but hopefully the experience will be worth it.;
, Bad movies are almost always more fun to see with a group; the more people around to crack jokes and point things out, the funnier the movie will seem. Agree on a time and a location and prepare for a unique movie-watching experience.

, The biggest mistake you can make while trying to enjoy a bad movie is trying to make sense of it. Most of these movies don't make very much sense, and that is precisely why they are hilarious. Simply embrace the plot holes, horrible cliches, and seemingly pointless dialogue.

, Especially if you are watching with friends, this will make the movie seem funnier and create inside jokes that your friends will participate in long after the movie is over.

, Often, the more you think about bad movies, the funnier they seem, because you realize things you didn't notice while the movie was on. Also, look into the history of the movie and its director. Terribly hilarious movies tend to have terribly hilarious backstories that raise more questions about the movie's origins than they answer.

, The internet is full of reviews and commentary tracks that go along with laughably bad movies. Not only are they a great source to find other movies to watch, but they can also be shown before, after, or along with the movie for added hilarity.

, Inevitably, there are things you missed the first time. Also, watching the same movie with a different group of friends can be an entirely different experience.

You can also write a script yourself, if that's something you enjoy and are good at. When you're writing, or choosing a script there are a few things to look out for that can help you pick the best script possible.


Structure is key to a good story. The three-act structure is a device commonly used for scriptwriters to come up with a good story. It works like this: set-up (Act 1), confrontation (Act 2), resolution (Act 3). Key turning points happen at the end of Act 1 and Act 2.A good script shows rather than tells. You want your audience to guess at what is happening based on body language of the actors, what they're wearing, what they do, and how they say the lines. Screenplays are, by nature, extremely visual.Each scene has to be headed by a slug line, which tells whether the scene is interior or exterior, whether it is night or day, and where it is. (For example: INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT.)
When describing action all you are describing is the actual, factual of what will be seen on the screen. For example, instead of saying ""John enters the living room. He is angry because his girlfriend left him,"" you would say ""John enters the living room. He slams the door behind him and kicks the sofa."";
, Storyboarding is incredibly important so that you know how best to direct each scene, what camera angles you want, what you want it to look like. You don't have to stick to the storyboard as you're shooting, but it will give you a place to start.Things that you'll be covering are: what characters are in each frame, how much time has elapsed between current frame and the previous frame, where the camera is in the frame (what the shot looks like).
Your storyboard doesn't have to be perfect. It simply needs to give you a sense of the script and how the script should be shot.
Decide on the tone for your film. A gritty film about a private detective in the 1920s is going to have a very different feel than a light-hearted comedy about the perils of parenthood. A great way to make your movie fail is to switch the tone midway through, so that the light-hearted comedy suddenly becomes a tragedy without warning. This doesn't mean that a comedy cannot have elements of tragedy, or vice versa, but your film, especially if you're new to directing, should stick to one tone.

, You can't make a movie without some kind of financing, especially if you want it to be a movie that people other than your family watches. Filming equipment costs money, you'll need props, locations, actors, and tech people. Most of these things cost money.


If you're going to indie film route, you should still try to find a producer for your movie, someone who will figure out funding, get you filming locations.

, If you're low on funding you'll probably have to do the casting yourself, but otherwise it's a good idea to hire a casting director to do that job. Usually a casting director has access to more avenues in which to find appropriate actors for your movie.

You want people who have been in other films and understand how it works. Theater actors are not great for this, as acting in a theater and acting for a movie is incredibly different.
There are good up and coming actors who aren't too expensive. What you're looking for is charisma and talent. This usually means not just casting your friends in the roles (unless you're just directing a film for fun, in which case, have at it).

, Movies require locations (a bedroom, a living room, a street corner, a garden, etc) in which to film. Sometimes you can film in these locations for free and sometimes you have to pay. Likewise, you'll be needing props, costumes, make-up, and materials for filming (a mike, cameras, etc).


If you have a producer this is what they will be doing. Making sure that you have everything you need and the permission to film in certain locations. Otherwise, you'll have to do this yourself.
If you're on a really low budget, talk to friends and family. Maybe you know someone who's good at make-up to do the make-up for you, or maybe your aunt happens to have a bunch of period clothes up in her attic.

, If you don't have a clear vision and plan for how you're going to film, what it's going to look like, it's going to be a difficult filming process. You need to have the specifics laid out and you need to know all the things to do that make a filming process successful.


Create a shot list. This is basically a numbered list of all the shots in the film that describes the framing, the focal length, camera movement, and things you need to bear in mind (like possible filming concerns). You can also double this up with the storyboard, whatever works best for you.
Create a script breakdown. This is basically the process in which you identify every single item needed for shooting the movie, including location, props, any effects, etc. Again, it will be easier if you have a producer to help you out with this.
Tech scout with all your tech people. This means going over to the movie locations and go over every single shot with your tech people so that everyone knows exactly what to expect for each shot. You can discuss problems that may arise (things like specific lighting, sound issues, etc).

, If you can get a good 1st AD (assistant director) you'll want to. They're the person who yells at the actors if needed and who does things like, takes down all the notes during the tech scout, and who schedules all the shots.


Scheduling the shots basically means setting up the schedule for when the shots are going to be filmed. This is almost never in chronological order, but usually has more to do with lighting or camera set-ups.

, This seems like a very obvious step, but it's really important. When you get to the actual filming part you want the actors to be comfortable with their lines and their blocking.


Start off by having a script run-through, where you and your actors sit around a table and run through each scene. They'll be getting more comfortable with the words and with you and with each other, which will make the filming part much easier.
Really talented actors don't necessarily need much of a rehearsal before shooting and it can be better to not over-rehearse highly emotional scenes so that they will be fresh for the actual shoot, but that only works with seasoned and talented actors, so if you're working with amateur actors, practicing the script before shooting is a good idea.

, An actor can't give a stunning performance without knowing their script backwards and forwards. You do not want them to suddenly turn up on set the day of the shoot without having learned their lines. This is why rehearsals are so important.

, This means what is going on in the scene beyond simply the dialogue. It will also tell an actor what his or her character's true intentions are, in the scene and in the movie, which will determine how you direct them.Less is more in acting in a movie. What you want for your actors is a strong presence that shows even when they aren't doing anything. An actor that can draw viewers into the character without doing much.
For example: John, our angry protagonist from above, is going to be played differently depending on whether he hates his girlfriend for leaving him, or if he's still in love with her (or both).

, The cliché of the angry, screaming director is just that, a cliché. As the director you're the one in charge (if you don't have a producer) which means that everyone's going to be looking to you for calm and clear direction.


This is why the storyboard and script breakdown are so important. You can refer back to them for each scene and for showing your vision to those who are working for you.
Remember that a movie gets made based on the contributions of a lot of different people, even if the director and the actors get most of the credit. It's best not to behave like you're the most important thing on set, when you're dealing with your cast and crew.

, This is for the actors. If you've explained the subtext to your actors and your vision for the film, there shouldn't be too much of a problem of them doing what they need to do in their scenes, but it is important that you give specific instructions, even ones like ""try that line again faster.""


Take copious notes. On your shot list write down specific camera critical things you are going to want your actors to do. The clearer and more detailed you can be in your feedback and your requests, the easier it will be for the actors and the crew to follow through on your vision.
Give negative or detailed feedback to actors in private. You can even do this when other people are around, just as long as only the actor who is receiving the feedback is hearing it. This way no one gets embarrassed or offended.
Make sure to give positive feedback. Actors like to know that their work is being appreciated and that they are doing the right thing. Make sure you let them know that, even if it's something as simple as ""I really liked what you did in the last scene; let's try that when we're filming the shot.""
Sometimes, if you have a really good actor, it's best to let them do their own thing without a whole lot of direction. While it may not always go in the direction you had planned, scenes and the movie itself have a possibility to go in a new and fresh direction.

, When you're directing you're going to need to know the different kinds of shots and camera angles and camera movements so that you know how to shoot each scene and what you're trying to get from each scene. Different angles and types of shots change the feel of a scene.Framing (or shot length): extreme long shot (usually an establishing shot, from as much as a quarter mile away), long shot (this is a ""life size"" shot that corresponds with the distance between audience and screen in a cinema; it focuses on the characters and the background images), medium shot (this is usually used for dialogue scenes or a close-up on a certain action and usually contains 2 to 3 characters from the waist up), close up (this shot concentrates on a face or object with the background as a blur, usually used to get into the mind of a character), extreme close up (usually focuses on one specific detail like a mouth or eyes, usually used for some sort of dramatic effect).
Camera angle designates the relationship between the camera and whatever is being shot and gives emotional information to the audience about the object or character in the shot. Bird's eye view (shows a scene from directly overhead, putting the audience in a god-like position, as well as making normal things unrecognizable), high angle (this has the camera above the action using a crane and gives a sort of overview of what's going on), eye level (this is a more neutral angle with the camera acting as another human observing the scene), low angle (tends to make the audience feel a sense of powerlessness, or confusion and as it is looking up at an object it can inspire fear or disorientation), oblique/canted angle (used in lots of horror films, this shot inspires a sense of imbalance, transition, and instability).
Camera movements make the action seem slower rather than the quick cuts, but it can also have a more ""realistic"" effect. Pans (scans a scene horizontally), tilts (scans a scene vertically), dolly shots (also known as tracking/trucking shots, where the camera follows the action on a moving vehicle of some sort), hand-held shots (the Steadicam camera makes it so the handheld shots are less jerky, while still instilling a sense of immediacy and realism), crane shots (this is more or less a dolly shot in the air), zoom lenses (this changes the magnification of the image, changing the position of the audience either slowly or quickly), aerial shot (a shot similar to the crane shot, but taken from a helicopter and usually used as an establishing shot at the beginning of the movie).

, This is basically when the crew comes in to set up everything. If you have an assistant director, it isn't really necessary that you be there, but it's a good idea to show anyway. You can start thinking about the shots for the day and considering how best to do them and whether you need to change anything.

, Before you start shooting the shot and while your tech team is setting up the equipment, run the actors through the shot and figure out what they're going to be doing in relation to the camera (where they'll be standing, what type of shots you'll be using, how they're going to say their lines).


Experiment with the viewfinder to test how the different shots are going to look. At this point you might want to change and redefine some of your scenes and shots to get the best possible scene.

, For each shot you'll need to know the focal length, the camera placement, the actors' marks (where they need to stand, etc), which lenses to use and the movement of the camera. You'll set up the shot, using all these different considerations, with your cinematographer.Now depending on the type of director you are and the type of cinematographer you have (maybe you're the one making the deciding on the shots) you'll need to give more or less direction. Discuss with them the lighting and the camerawork until the shot is ready to be taken.

, The filming doesn't take that long and it's usually a short scene that's being shot. You run through the scene, using the camera movement, and placement, etc. that you'd already covered with your cinematographer. When you call cut you're ready to move on to looking over the take to see how it went.

, Reviewing the take on the video monitor right away lets you consider how to make the scene better, how close the scene comes to your original idea. Then you'll repeat the scene until it holds up to your scrutiny.


This is very different from reviewing takes in the editing room later on. There you have the time, clarity, and perspective to see every single thing you could have done to make that scene better.

, What you're trying to do at this point is to put together the film edits in a way that is seamless, smooth, and coherent. As a general rule you want to cut on action, so that there isn't much of non-action boring the audience. This means that you cut from one shot to another right as the action is performed (like John opening the door to the living room). You'll join the shots with the first part of John's motion in the wide shot and the second part in a tighter shot.


Cutting on cross-frame movement is typical a reveal shot. For example, medium shot on two men talking, one man moves and reveals close-up on villain's face.
Cut to an empty frame, where the subject comes in. For example, this is often used with someone stepping out of a car, where you only see the foot. The foot moves into the empty frame.
Remember, as you're cutting that it takes about 2 film frames (equaling about 1/12th of a second) for your audience's eyes to switch from one side of the screen to the other.

, For your soundtrack you will want to make sure that it works well with the film. There's nothing worse than a score that doesn't fit with the tone and the appearance of a movie. When you're discussing the music composition with your composer, talk about things like style of music, instrumentation, music speed, music cues, etc. A music composer needs to know your vision for the film to make an appropriate score.


Listen to the demo tracks that a composer gives you, so you can keep track of how it's coming on there end and where there need to be changes made.
Now, if you're doing the music yourself, you need to make sure that you're not stealing copyrighted music for your movie, because you can get into trouble for that. A lot of times you can find composers for cheap in your town or city. It's not going to be professional level (but then, your movie probably isn't either), but it can still make it sound good.
There is a difference between soundtrack and score. The soundtrack is previously recorded music that fits a scene or sequence through content, rhythm and mood. Score is music that specifically accompanies certain images or motifs in a film (like the ""shark theme"" in Jaws).

, This means making sure that the soundtrack suits the finished and edited film. It also means going in and adding sounds that need to be added, or enhancing sounds already in place. You can edit out sounds that shouldn't be there (like a plane going overhead) or edit in sounds that should.Diegetic sound means that a sound is made by something that the audience can see in the image or the shot. While this will usually be captured when you're doing filming, it is almost always enhanced later, as well as adding things like ambient sound (outdoors) and room tone (indoors) to cover up things like a plane going overhead, but to make the background noise not utter silence.
Non-diegetic sound means that a sound is coming from outside the image, as in a voice-over or the musical score.

, Now that you've shot your film and edited it and added all the different sounds, you're ready to show it off. Sometimes this means gathering some friends and family and showing your hard work, but you can also usually find other avenues, especially if this is something that is important to you.


A lot of cities and states have film festivals that you can enter. Depending on the quality of the film it might even win, but at least a wider audience than your family and friends will see it.
If you have a producer, this is usually something they'll have been working on and usually you won't have gotten the green light on your project if there weren't some sort of distribution scheduled after its completion.

Create and design unique superheroes and villains first.,
Write down the characteristics of your heroes and villains and consider all the things that make them supernatural and other elements:


Create special powers - make sure it isn't as basic as just being able to fly.,
Plan the trilogy carefully.",How to Create a Superhero Movie Trilogy," Don't copy Spider-Man or any other superheros because this isn't very original and if you do happen to strike it really lucky and make a film good enough for the independent film market, you will want something very original to capture peoples' imagination.;
,






Consider where they live - on Earth or somewhere else






Will there be one superhero or a group?






Choose names, clothes and special features.







, On a piece of paper or computer, put together a plan of your trilogy ideas:


Start with the first movie. You might wish to make it about the hero getting his or her super powers and having fun with them for a while until the villain shows up.






Second movie. This might be about the hero's personal life (love, money, violence etc.) and a character (villain) interfering with it.






Third movie. In this one, you will probably wish to create a climactic showdown with the toughest and most powerful villain that your superhero has to face.

Understand the essential parts of a movie idea.,
Make your movie idea out of these three simple elements.,
Set aside time to brainstorm.,
Find inspiration in real life.,
Decide on a genre.,
Tweak existing movies into something original.,
Come up with your log line to cement the idea.",How to Come Up with a Movie Idea1," Most people get stuck because they want to come up with the entire movie at once, instead of starting with the necessities and building from there. Many movies are made up of simply mixing and matching three things --setting, character, and conflict -- until you get a new movie. Sometimes, if one of them is unique enough, this is all you need to start writing (Cabin in the Woods starts on a government-run horror movie factory, which is a unique enough idea to kick off the plot). No matter what type of movie you want to make, you'll be well on your way if you just come up the following:



The Setting: Where does your movie take place in time and space. Do you envision a space epic or a medieval earth? Or is it simply in a small town somewhere?

The Protagonist(s): Who is the main character? You don't need traits yet, just a vague outline of a person. Are they a space pilot? Are they a stable boy? A dental hygienist?

The Conflict: What does your character want? Do they want to be a hero? Do they want to fall in love? Do they hate their job/boss?;
, All movies, from the odd independents to the biggest blockbusters, are just a matching of these three concepts. Don't worry about the intricacies, subtlety, or finer points yet -- these come from writing the idea. You need a strong base idea to build upon.


Space Epic + Pilot + Desire to be a Hero = Star Wars.

Medieval + Stable Boy + Hero/Love = A Knight's Tale.

Small Town + Dental Hygienist + Hate Job = Horrible Bosses.

Juvenile Detention + Idealist Councilors + Kid Who Don't Want Counseling = Short Term 12.


, Ideas rarely, if ever, appear out of thin air. The reason why some people seem to come up with great movie ideas is because they take time to do it. This is as simple as grabbing a pen and paper, removing distractions, and taking some time to think. If you need help, give yourself some prompts. Most importantly, write everything down -- on the subway, at home, at work. These will be the building blocks of bigger ideas.""What it..."" are the two most important words for brainstorming. Jurassic Park, for example, is the result of ""What if people brought dinosaurs back to life?""
""What would happen if two of my favorite movies collided?""
Look up a news event that interests you. What would happen if you were there?
Write about your interests -- any of them. Clerks was built out of nerdy passions and rooftop hockey, Superbad comes from a love of classic teen-party movies, Lincoln was written by people passionate about history. Nothing is off limits.

, In any major newspaper right now there are likely 5 stories that could be turned into good movies. Real life is often stranger than fiction, and you'll find that news stories are a great launching point for new stories. How did the person who just won the World Hotdog Eating Contest become a professional eater? Why is the local country club shutting down? What was it like for the cop in the police blotter to respond to a call about ""missing bacon?""Use these things as jumping off points -- the starts of plots or ideas that your imagination can then take off with.

, Genre is the type of movie, and while many movies can be said to have multiple genres, most films fit closely in one or the other. Genres include Comedy, Romance, Sci-Fi, Action, Horror, Drama, or Documentary, but there are also many combinations, like Rom-Com, Dramedy, Action Horror, etc. The beauty of genre is that it helps you develop a movie plot -- giving you focus for brainstorming. For example:


Do you love horror films? Then your movie idea must involve coming up with a good villain. Once you have the monster or bad guy, you have your movie idea.
Do you love Rom-Coms? Then you need a girl and a guy who don't seem like they should fall in love (Republican and Democrat, one is married, one's an alien, etc.)
Do you love Sci-Fi? Think of an invention you wish existed, from time-travel, space ships, or teleportation to a device that builds new planets. Your story will be the repercussions of that invention.

, You will never come up with a completely original idea. Though that sounds harsh, it is actually incredibly liberating. No movie ever made didn't draw influence and ideas from movies and art before it, and yours will be no exception. How can you twist or change something you enjoy into something new? Ideas include:



Austin Powers is simply a comedic twist on spy movies, particularly James Bond, that had dominated the theaters. The plot is the same, it just happens to have jokes instead of action scenes.

O Brother Where Art Thou is a retelling, nearly scene for seen, of Homer's The Iliad, but it is set in the bluegrass soaked world of the rural South.

Avatar is strikingly similar to Dances With Wolves, but by setting it in space James Cameron was able to get a brand new take on things.Warm Bodies has all the trappings of a Rom-Com, but one of the main characters is a zombie. This quick ""mash-up"" of movie types helped it stand out immensely.

, Log lines are quick, one sentence summaries of your script. Good log lines tell you three things: the hook (what makes the movie different), the conflict, and the characters/settings. To learn how to write good log lines, check out some famous examples.



Back to the Future: A young man is transported to the past where he must reunite his parents before he and his future are gone forever.Jaws: A police chief with a phobia for open water battles a gigantic shark, in spite of a greedy town council who demands that the beach stay open.

Ratatouille: A Parisian rat secretly teams up with an untalented chef to prove that anyone can cook, despite what the critics, and pest-control, might think. "

Give your idea a film structure.,
Develop your characters.,
Personalize your idea by tweaking expectations.,
What happens if you change the setting up?,
Keep coming up with ideas.",How to Come Up with a Movie Idea2," There are a lot of structures out there, ranging from the basic 3-Act movie to the common ""hero's journey."" But they can all be distilled into 5 basic parts that are found in 99% of all movies, from action and drama to rom-coms and children's films. Take your idea and come up with these 5 crucial points and you will have a movie that stands a chance of getting made.



The Set-Up: Give the characters, the setting, and the world. This is the first 10% or less of your movie, and it introduces us to the movie. It should not be longer than 10 pages.

In Star Wars, George Lucas introduces the premise of space warfare, the conflict (""Help me Obi-Wan, you're my only hope""), and many central characters (Luke, Leah, Darth Vader, R2-D2, and C3-P0).



The Change of Plans/Opportunity/Conflict: Something happens that sets your conflict in motion on page 9-10 -- Erin Brockovich gets a job, the school of Superbad throws a party, Neo is introduced to The Matrix, etc. The next 10-20 pages show your characters dealing with this change.

In Star Wars, this is when Luke turns down Obi-Wan, but sees that his family has been killed. He agrees to go on the quest to save Leah.



The Point of No Return: Up until this point, the characters are working hard to make their goals a reality. But, at the halfway point of the movie, something happens to make it impossible to turn back. A Bond villain attacks again, the Gladiator arrives in Rome, Thelma and Louise rob their first store, etc.

In Star Wars, they are trapped at the Death-Star halfway into the movie. They cannot make it to Alderaan as planned, and must fight their way out.



The Major Set-Back: Since the point of no return, the stakes have gotten higher. To the characters and audience, all hope seems lost. This is when the girl and guy break-up in every romantic comedy ever made when Ron Burgundy gets fired in Anchorman, and when John McClane is beaten and bloody in Die Hard. This comes at the 75% mark.

In Star Wars, Obi-Wan has died and the Death Star is in motion. The only chance to win is a last-ditch effort to blow up the Death Star.



The Climax: The characters make one last, all-out push to reach their goals, culminating in their biggest challenge of all. This is the run through the airport moment, the final holes in Caddyshack, or the final showdown between hero and villain. Once resolved, the last 10% of the script ties up loose ends and shows the aftermath of the climax.In Star Wars, Luke makes his heroic final run on the Death Star, blowing it up despite all odds being against him.



, You want your characters to feel real, as if they are driving the story and not some writer in LA. Remember that good characters are the heart of a movie -- they are who the audience feels for, loves, and hates, and even great movie idea will fail with bad characters. This is easier said than done, but there a couple of tips that will make your characters fit into your movie idea seamlessly:


Make sure your characters are round. This means that they have multiple facets, not just an ""angry man,"" or ""strong heroine."" Round characters have strengths and weaknesses, which make them relatable to the audience.
Give your characters a desire and a fear. Even if there is only one of each, a good character wants something but is unable to get it. Their ability or inability to get over their fear (of being poor, of being alone, of space aliens, of spiders, etc.) is what drives their conflict.
Make sure your characters have agency. A good character is not moved around because your script needs them to go somewhere. A good character makes choices, and the plot follows. Sometimes this is one choice that drives everything else (Llewellyn, No Country for Old Men, Luke Skywalker joining Obi-Wan in Star Wars), sometimes there are a series of good/bad choices at every turn (every character in American Hustle)., It may feel limiting to have such a rigid structure on your script, but it actually makes it easier to surprise the audience. How can you take 5-point structure and recognizable characters and make them your own? How can you make this movie original? The best way to do this -- break some rules:


What happens if, instead of succeeding in the climax, the characters fail?
What happens to your ""round"" character if they refuse to change? What happens if protagonist isn't really the main character, such as in Ferris Beuller's Day Off, where Ferris's friend Cameron is the real character showing growth?

, A rom-com set in NYC is nothing new, but what about one set in rural Thailand? At a bowling alley? In a nursing home?

, The most important thing to realize when coming up with ideas is that they come with practice. Your first 10, 20, or even 50 ideas may not be so good, but wading through the bad ideas will help you recognize the good. No one comes up with perfectly formed ideas every time, and you will not be the exception.


Keep a notebook you fill up with ideas as you come up with them
Try brainstorming with a friend to bounce ideas off each other twice as fast.
Work through this process with each idea -- fleshing out a movie idea into the crucial parts is how you'll know if it is an idea worth pursuing.

Identify the information that the audience needs to know and ensure that all of it is included.,
Emphasize the information appropriately.,
Communicate both information and feelings to your audience.",How to Deliver Information to an Audience (Director's Edition)," A common mistake for directors is omitting information. Though some information may seem not so important, it will confuse the audience and take them out of the movie.


For example, a scene involving a burglar and a locked cabinet of valuables might be shown like this: The burglar discovers that the cabinet is locked, and opens it with a key. Where did the key come from? How did the burglar get the key? If it is not shown, the audience will not know it. Instead, try this: The burglar discovers that the cabinet is locked, we see the burglar open the top draw and remove a key from it, thus opening the cabinet. Now, with the missing piece of information included, the audience will be satisfied.;
, Though identifying all the information is important, if you un-emphatically present the information, the audience might miss it. When adding emphasis to information, remember the following:


The bigger the image size, the more emphatic the information contains.
By organizing the composition of the image, you can call attention to the information you wish to emphasize
The perspective from which the audience sees the information, or camera angle, is a powerful tool for emphasizing information. Objective inserts is shot from no particular point of view, thus neutral; subjective inserts are usually from a certain point of view, thus more emphatic.
You can control emphasis simply by how long you display a piece of information on the screen. The audience has more time to notice and absorb the information when it is on screen longer.

, Communicating information is only half the job of a director; A good director presents information in a way that involves the audience emotionally. Here are ways to do this effectively:


The bigger the image size, the more emotional impact it carries.
Control the length of a sequence by shooting it in greater or smaller number of shots. By stretching the length of a sequence, the director increases the feeling of urgency. A sequence with ten shots is more suspenseful than a sequence with three shots.
Camera Angles can contribute to the overall emotional effect of a scene. High angles often convey a feeling of detachment, while low angles emphasize the power of the image, and the powerlessness of the viewer. Head-on, frontal angles feel formal and calm, while diagonal setups convey movement and energy.
The feel of an image is strongly affected by the lens used to record it. Wide angle lenses exaggerate depth and motion toward or away from the camera; the effect they convey is dynamic and energetic. Telephoto lenses, by contrast, suppress depth and motion, keeping the viewer at a distance and conveying a sense of formality.
Camera movement can add significantly to the emotional cast of a scene. A stationary camera, panning and tilting from one position, conveys a sense of detached observation. A moving camera, especially when dollying in and out, becomes a part of the action. Moreover, a constantly moving camera imparts a feeling of restless energy.
Individual shots can be made shorter or longer, depending on the effect desired. Short shots with quick cuts convey a sense of dynamic energy, while lengthy shots feel calm and deliberate. That is why fights are typically constructed from many brief shots, while romantic scenes are often assembled from fewer but lengthier angles.

, Tell your friends about your film project. Recruit people who you think would be a good help.

, Let everybody give their own creative ideas about your project.


Make sure everybody has a chance to share ideas.
Think about possible story-lines and genres for the project, such as action, comedy, survivor, horror, etc.

, This will avoid you from any confuse or unclear dialogue or action movement. You don't necessarily need a set script, but it helps to have a solid plan.


Remember to plan it be carefully and be clever. What you need plan is the storyline (plot), actor action, dialogue and movement, location of film and camera anger or position.
Make sure you create a believable/fun dialogue that's easy for the actors to read to avoid from any confused or mistakes.

, Make sure location of film is safe from any disruptions, and be sure to not trespassing. Get a permission from owner of location or lands before taking a film.


Ask for permission first before starting to shoot.
If you want to create an action or parkour film, make sure the location that you choose is safe.
Make sure the place that you choose is free from noise sound.

, Make sure your crew has memorized the dialogue, action, movement, etc.


Don't force your friends/crew to do any stunts or dangerous action moves that they're not comfortable with.
Give your friends/crew time to memorize the dialogue.

, In this step, start recording your action and make sure to cut and retry again if you experience any disruptions or mistakes.


Taking and recording the film from Android can be tricky at first, but becomes easier with practice. Make sure your Android is in the good position and angle. Always cut and switch another position of your camera to take another shot.
Make sure to hold your Android perfectly!
Always tell your cameraman to focus during recording to make sure your end result will be clear.
Make sure you pause or stop the recording when trying to switch to a new angle/focus.

, If someone makes a mistake, just start over and try again. Don't give up.


Don't be mad or angry if a member of your crew makes a mistake, because it's normal. Everybody can accidentally make a mistake during filming. What you have to do is make sure your crew is paying attention and is serious about doing the film.

, Make sure everything came out how you intended it.


If you spotter any mistakes, try shooting that particular scene again. You don't have to start the whole film over, since you can edit together different shots and scenes later.

, You can download any video maker from Google Play Store, and search for good options online (check the reviews). When you find one you like, use it to trim your video and merge your different scenes into one film.

",How to Create a Low Budget Movie," Understand that this is a costly, time-consuming venture that will leave little time for hanging out with your friends and having fun. Then again, if you're making a low-budget movie, what better way to do it than to do it by hanging out with your mates, being the center of attention and having fun?;
, It doesn't even have to be truly original - it could be a loose remake or spoof. You could always use a book as inspiration - anything created before 1900 is public domain and you can just use that. If you want something cohesive, have an idea first. If you don't really care, just make stuff up as you go along (David Lynch did this for Inland Empire - you decide how good that was).

, It doesn't have to be perfect and you don't have to follow it 100%. It just gives you a great outline to start with. If you want, you can just write the scenes and have the actors improvise their lines.

,, This helps you to know what shots you want to have in the movie before going out to shoot them. Storyboards don't have to be drawn by an artist, either. You can draw stick figures, take pictures of action figures, use storyboarding software like Storyboard Quick or whatever you think works best. Again, this just gives you a basic outline of what you need to shoot and what will be in each shot.

, Figure out how much money you can spend on this film of yours and figure out the best ways to spend it. Remember, you'll need something to record sound on, a simple lighting kit, and a camera. Anything beyond that and it might be too complicated. You'll also need props, food for your cast and crew, transportation for some of them, and you might even have to pay for locations. A schedule helps everyone, too, because they'll know when they need to be with you and where you'll be.

, This allows your actors to get a real feel for the scene before they go out and waste time, tape, and/or film. This way they can learn the lines together or, if you're allowing them to improvise, they can start now and generate ideas for lines they'd like to use.

, And by crew, we mean a group of people who may or may not really know what they're doing. If you're really serious, put an ad in the paper and find a few guys who went to film school who know a little about lighting, recording sound or working a camera. As a director, you'll be able to get closer to what you want from people who have even the slightest idea as to what they're doing. Or, if you want a more hands-on approach and want to learn more about the various aspects of film making, ask some of your friends to hold mics or positions lights with you. That way you'll both learn and you just might appreciate it more.

, Are you in school? See if the school owns a camera. Buddy up to the technology teacher. Do you know someone who owns a hardware store? They can get you lights and maybe some props. Tell them you're making a movie and they might give you a discount. Need a location badly but you think you might need to pay for it? Explain that you're making a movie and most people will give you stuff. People love movies and they want to be a part of one. Just tell people that you're making a movie and it'll open up doors you didn't know existed.

, Making a film is more than picking up a camera and filming something. There is a whole legal side that must be taken care of in pre-production before filming starts. You must get a film permit from whatever city you are filming in. If you do not have a permit and the cops show up your production will be shut down. You also need to purchase insurance for your production. If you do not have insurance and something goes wrong you can be held liable and sued for injury or damaged property.

, It's that simple.

,, Be nice to everyone and try to explain to them what you want without making them feel stupid. You're supposed to be having fun, right? So let everyone else have fun, too. Remember to watch your footage as often as possible. You don't want to lose a shot because it was too dark and not be able to go back and redo it because you only had the location for one day. When you are shooting don't forget about the sound. Film in areas where there is not a lot of street noise. Street noise will make it hard to hear your dialogue. Don't lose your cool and never forget that you're supposed to be having fun. You aren't getting paid, so don't treat it like your job. Remember to make note of takes and use a clapboard. There's a lot to know, but you can duck and dive through a lot of it. Just have fun.

, If your goal is to have this film is to get a distribution deal or even enter it into a festival there is a list of SAG rules you must follow and paperwork you must fill out. If you don't you'll basically end up with a home video you can do absolutely nothing with.

, Most programs are easy to learn and will allow you to sync sound and music with almost no trouble. And don't rush it. Editing takes time.Its good to use a good software like particle illusion or an FX product like Fx vision lab studios (all though these cost money ,100-200 pounds)

,, If you're stuck, make a few versions and show people. They've probably seen a lot of movies, too, and will tell what works and what doesn't.

, Bask in the glory of knowing that you are now an independent filmmaker. People will love you a little bit more now.

, It only leaves your pocket to take shots, change the battery or swap out cards. Forget about cellphone cameras, the sensors in them are about the size of a full stop and the frame rates generally suck.

, That perfect shot will only happen once, and when it's gone you can't ask for a second take.

, A decent microphone with windshield, the back half of a cheap fishing pole and a mini-disc recorder is ideal. This will all fit in a messenger bag and leave room for everything else, plus you get to strut around like Jack Bauer.

, Take spare batteries and spare cards. For that matter, take another camera.

, Hopping on a bus? Point the camera out the window and let the vehicle track for you. Might be better on a train, though, they're not as bumpy.

, Mount the camera on a gorilla clamp or bulldog clamp on the frame of a bicycle. Have the actors (or at least one of them) carry the sound kit in his/her pocket and leave it running, or strap it to the bike so it's out of frame. Pointing the camera forward while you ride is also another great method of capturing stock footage.

",How to Create a Good Experimental Film," You may have access to a VHS camcorder, an 8mm movie camera, or even an old 35mm film camera, but to simplify editing, you will probably want to be able to transfer the video to a digital format so it can be edited on a PC.;
, You may decide to work without a script, or even actors, but you will find that there are a lot of jobs involved in making even a short film.

, You will want to consider many things in the early planning stage of your film.


Film genre. Experimental film can be outside the envelope of conventional film making, but to be successful, you will have to decide on a subject, whether nature, comedy, terror, romance, educational, or art.
Script. If you plan to include speaking parts in your film, you will need to develop a script unless you are going to have your performers improvise the content. Your script can be word for word dialogue, or a general ideas of an on screen dialogue relative to the film subject, ad-libbed by the participants with speaking parts. The creative ability and ability to coordinate on the fly will determine the best approach.
Set or sets. When you have made a script or outline of your film objectives, you will have to decide if you need a stage, sets, backdrops, or other props and constructed elements to ""fill in"" the frame of your filming. Building custom sets, particularly special effects sets with moving stages, changing backdrops, and realistic (if necessary) elements may require a substantial investment of time, labor and money.
Cast. When you have decided your film subject, you will need to decide how large a cast to utilize, and what particular characteristics your actors will need. If you are filming a sci-fi drama, you may want very tall, large actors in costume to look like aliens, or fairly young kids to look like diminutive adults (with proper makeup).
Costumes. Again, if the story line of the film requires it, you may have to create or obtain costumes. For some period type films, the local thrift store may be able to fill your needs, but you may have to design and create your own costumes, or buy them from a theatrical supply or costume retailer.
Location. This is one of the largest ""players"" in getting an audience to believe your film. You will have a hard time selling a metropolitan street scene if you film in small town middle America, so work your plot and subject into the context you are able to shoot location for. The exception may be using ""juxtaposition"" as a technique, since the film is experimental, and the normal rules do not apply, but this goes for all of the previous steps.

, This will give you an idea of how the frame will be filled with background, and how lighting will need to be observed to give the actually ""keeper"" shots the right balance of light, shadow, and color. Often, a certain location is only appropriate for a shot when the weather, natural light, and other elements are combined perfectly. Use your imagination to fill in the action in each scene, so that the camera angle and the on film action will be in proper proportion to the screen as a whole. In other words, don't make actors disappear into a background, but also, don't film so ""close in"" as to eliminate desired background effects.

, This sounds confusing, but for some possible film subjects, you may simply be shooting an open shot of a place or occurrence (think space shuttle lift off or rush hour traffic, both with an interesting point of focus not related to input from added elements like actors or props).

, It is almost time to begin shooting, provided you have settled on a subject, found a location, built sets, created costumes, and assembled a cast and crew.


Remove any unnecessary ""fluff"", such as elaborate or complicated sets, costumes, etc., that don't contribute significantly to your finished product.
Go over details with the cast, how emotions should be played out, timing of lines from the script, camera angles, and any other considerations or suggestions which may have developed to this point. Once you begin shooting, you will want to stay as much as possible with the plan to keep things simple.

, Have all the elements in place, everyone on cue, and all distractions put away, so everyone can concentrate on their part of the process. Depending on how involved and detailed the scene is, and how critical the time window for filming is, you want to have as much control over the events on camera as possible.

, This may be the least time consuming part of the production, and depending on the length of your film, the shoot may be over and the film heading to the editing room before you know it.

, If you have a movie editing software program on a computer, and you used digital media or can convert your film to digital, you can edit on a computer almost anywhere. Logging frames, cutting and splicing, and scene or photo enhancement is up to you. Think about what you set out to create, and what you want your audience to see as you edit.

, Explain what the camera should be doing for each particular frame, such as ""Camera follows John as he walks 4 steps to the left.""

, For each frame in the commercial storyboard, write out the intended dialogue, such as ""John: Our company is innovative and will get the job done.""

, For each frame, add details surrounding any extra audio you want to include, such as sound effects and background music.

, If there are to be any visual effects you need to add after filming your commercial, include them in that frame. For example, if your character is talking about the world, mention in your storyboard that a picture of a globe should be turning around in the corner of the screen.

Let your storyboard morph as you go.",How to Create a Storyboard," Establishing the parameters for when and where your story takes place, and deciding in which order the events of the story happen chronologically, is the best way to organize your story so you can begin bringing it to life. If your story isn't completely linear (e.g. there are flashbacks, flash forwards, shifting perspectives, alternate outcomes, multiple timelines, time travel, and so on), you can still create a narrative timeline.


Make a list of the main events of the story in the order they will be told. This is how they will appear on screen.
If you’re storyboarding for a commercial, establish what scenes will occur and in what order.;
, A storyboard is meant to give its viewer the gist of how the story will translate to film. The point isn't to try to recreate the entire experience in a flip book, but to demonstrate important key parts that will draw the viewer in. Think your story through and brainstorm a list of the key moments that you want to illustrate on your storyboard.


Pick scenes that show the plot developing from start to finish.
Turning points are important to show. Any time there’s a plot twist or an important change, include it in the storyboard to move the story along.
You may also want to depict changes in setting. If the story begins in one city and moves to another, make sure that will be clear in your illustrations.
If you’re storyboarding for a commercial, the process is no different: pick key images that will represent the flow and direction of the film from start to finish. As a general guideline, keep in mind that for a typical 30-second commercial, a storyboard should have no more than 15 frames. Factor in two seconds per frame on average.

, A storyboard can be incredibly detailed, with illustrations depicting every shot. If you’re in the preliminary stages of a feature-length film, you have too much ground to cover to get this detailed just now. However, you might eventually want to break the film down into individual scenes, with a separate storyboard for each one. This allows you to create a very detailed representation of the progression of individual scenes and is helpful when it comes to staying organized during film-making.If you're working on a film and breaking it down shot by shot, create what's called a shot list. For each shot on the list, you'll need to think about the shot's composition and other details involving how it will actually be filmed.
Remember that the point of the storyboard is to provide visual clarity and keep everyone on the same page. It’s not supposed to be a work of art in and of itself. Take a practical view when it comes to the level of detail you choose for your storyboard. You don’t want your viewer to get lost in trying to interpret your illustrations instead of seeing the bigger picture.
A good storyboard will be easily understood by anyone viewing it. Potentially, a director, cameraman, scene selector, or even a prop specialist (just to name a few) may refer to the storyboard for reference, guidance and direction.

, Now that you know what main scenes you want to show, think about how to depict the action in each illustration. Go down your list of scenes and write a description of the most important elements of each one. This will help you determine what exactly to draw for your storyboard.


For example, you might want to have a cell that depicts a conversation between two main characters. What needs to be conveyed in this image? Are the characters fighting, smiling, or moving toward a destination? Some sort of action should take place in each drawing.
Take the setting into account as well. Is it important to have a certain view in the background behind the characters?

, You can draw a basic storyboard template by hand, simply dividing a posterboard into empty frames of the same size using a pencil and a straightedge. The setup should look similar to that of a comic book, with rows of square cells that show how the scene will look on a screen. If you prefer, you can use Adobe Illustrator, storyboardthat.com, Microsoft PowerPoint, Amazon's Storyteller, or inDesign to create a storyboard template in vertical or horizontal format.


The cell sizes should be drawn in the same aspect ratio as the finished video, such as 4:3 for a TV screen or 16:9 for a feature film screen. You can purchase special thumbnail sheets with these dimensions.A storyboard template for advertising should be comprised of rectangular frames into which you insert the visuals. If you want to include captions, make sure there’s space where you can write in video descriptions. There should also be a column for the audio, which is where you include the dialogue and sounds or music.
If you find yourself storyboarding for more than one project, it helps to have a good Wacom™ tablet, so you can board directly into Photoshop.
If you don’t want to design the images, you can hire a storyboard artist to provide the drawings. You will describe what goes on each frame and give the artist a written script to work from. He or she will provide you with either black and white or color illustrated frames that you can scan into the board in sequential order.

, Start bringing the scenes to life by drawing the sketches you mapped out into the template you designed. This is just your rough draft, so don’t try to make it perfect. As you sketch each scene, tinker with the following elements, erasing and redrawing as often as necessary:


Composition (lighting, foreground/background, color palette, etc.)
Angle from which the camera is shooting (high or low)
The type of shot (wide shots, close-ups, over-the-shoulder shots, tracking shots, etc.)Props (objects in the frame)
Actors (people, animals, cartoon talking couch, etc.: anything that can act rather than be acted upon)
Special effects

, Next to or below each cell, fill in your description of what’s happening in the scene.Include dialogue that will take place. Add information about the length of time the shot will take. Finally, number the cells so they’re easy to reference when you discuss your storyboard with others.

, Once you have identified the key points of the subject and worked out a design for each frame, review your work and make final changes. Be sure that each cell portrays the action you want it to portray. Tweak the descriptions and dialogue if necessary. It’s a good idea to have someone else review the storyboard to make sure it flows well and isn’t confusing.Consider adding color. If you’re creating an advertising storyboard, this will help your ideas pop.
Remember that it’s not necessarily important that the drawings look realistic or perfect. Depending on the viewing audience, simple stick figures might suffice. In most cases, storyboards don't need to be perfect, they only need to make sense to your team.

, While your storyboard illustrations don't need to look like they were created by a professional artist, there are a few artists' tricks you can use to make your images look more like movie scenes. This isn't mandatory, but it can help the people you're working with visualize the shot more clearly.Instead of drawing all of your characters as though they were standing on the same horizontal line, put them in perspective. Have some standing a little further from the camera and some standing closer. The ones standing further from the camera should appear smaller, with their feet higher up on the page, and the ones standing closer should appear larger, with their feet lower on the page.
When it's time to translate the storyboard to film, you'll have a much better idea of how to direct the shot.

, As you storyboard your film, think about your reasons for making each cut to a new shot. Advancing the story is about more than just hopping to the next plot point; you need to give a reason for why your characters do what they do. Storyboarding the motivations for your cuts will help you figure out how to build tension and keep the story moving when it comes to making the film.


For example, if you want to cut from one room to another, have a character in the first room look toward the door because they hear a noise.
This helps the story's continuity and keeps the viewer engaged.

, Your storyboard can be an extraordinary tool to have at your disposal when you're setting up your shots and directing your film. However, relying heavily on your storyboard might end up being too confining. As you make your film, you're bound to come across ideas for shots you didn't think of before. Allow yourself to drift from the board, or at least revise it, so that the filmmaking process is a bit more organic.Remember to accept others' input as you go along, especially if you're working with a talented film crew. A storyboard is meant to be edited and changed. It can often be improved by ideas you might not have thought up on your own.
Most film directors have a different style when it comes to storyboarding. Some map out every last detail, while others use it as a loose guide.

For example, in Zack and Miri Make a Porno, they decided to make a spoof of Star Wars, called Star Whores. What trendy piece of culture can you take from and add to?


Other examples of pornified titles might include Jack Reach-around, Breast of Memphis, Skyball 0069, or The Night Night Saga: Going Down. Though classy titles like ""Girls with Guns"" also get the message across just as well.
Your concept does not necessarily need to be a spoof. You may decide on a single-scene vignette that focuses on an intimate moment with just one or two actors, or a more ambitious movie with an original plot, such as the classic Deep Throat.;

Market. Determine if your movie will be released as a film, DVD, or sold to an online porn distributor.







Length of film. Depending on the concept and your market, your movie may be just 5 to 10 minutes, or a full-length movie.

Number of actors. This will be directly related to the length of the film. While a full-length traditional movie might be made with a very small ensemble—even one or two actors, a porno needs to keep things fresh from scene to scene

Props and set. If your movie is about aliens from outer space, you're gonna need to stockpile the green makeup and aluminum foil. What does your concept require?

, Ideally, you have investors. Your producer's pockets are deep and money isn't an issue. But realistically, you have your roommate's camera and some duct tape you stole from your school's workshop. Here are a few things to consider:


Equipment purchase or rental -- lighting, sound, editing, and music.
Actors. If you film a couple amateurs for a single-scene shot, the budget will be fairly low. The prices for a star, quite obviously, will be significantly higher than the price for a newcomer who is just looking for an opportunity to act. Do not be tempted to hire friends, especially your male friends: porn is demanding work that requires stamina, control, and the ability to perform on cue. Fitness is very important, and for guys, size does matter.
Location — not every neighborhood is okay with having porn filmed next door. And where can you make sure you won't be interrupted? Or, God forbid, the police drop by? Your home is an option...if you're comfortable with that.

, This doesn't necessarily include dialogue, but rather sketches out what will happen in each scene. Many pornos feature very little in the way of dialogue, other than specific requests regarding where to put what, when, and to what degree.


Save money and just write it yourself, if you're up to the challenge. No one's going to blame your movie for being bad because the writing sucked. If your creative juices only flow to the tune of, ""Well, how do you plan on paying for this pizza, ma'am?"" don't sweat it. You could hire a writer if you'd like, but it may not be the best way to spend your money.

, You don't need to be an artist; stick figures will do. The idea is to show what camera angles will be used in each scene and to get an idea for how much (and what part) of the talent should fill up the frame. Experiment right now with composition because closer isn't always better. You're still making something for cinematic enjoyment, even if it's not Sundance material.

, Hire actors. Interview them ahead of time, and make sure you have all your legal requirements covered. In some states, saying the wrong thing in a model interview can get you arrested. Make sure you're as honest with them as possible -- actors, especially when blindsided, can be quite a handful. They need to know exactly what they're in for -- from the daily schedule to the variety of sex acts desired to how those sex acts are performed. You, too, need to know what they are willing and not willing to do. There's no room to be shy here!


You may want to look into face or body doubles. After four hours of working on the job, actors get a little, how do you say, not into it. Or sometimes actors are great but they just don't have the bodies. With a little clever camerawork and post-production editing, you could have two people playing the same part. It's a little more expensive, but it could result in higher quality work.







, Do an internet search for a porn attorney; they can give you the legal requirements for your adult movie and walk you through the process. They will also give you the legal releases, contracts and documents needed for your crew and adult actors. Just because it's a porno doesn't mean there aren't rules and regulations you have to adhere to.

, General crew members should be easy to find, simply by promising them a good salary and offering anonymity. If you're operating on a budget, it's unlikely you'll have the full complement of staff that a traditional movie might enjoy (read: it'll be you and the cameraman), but you'll still want a few technical people to pull things together, if the money allows.


The director will be responsible for realizing your vision for the movie. You may be the director, or you can hire somebody who's familiar with the process.
The cameraman, even more than the talent (provided they're reasonably attractive and athletic), will make or break your film. They will know how to get the most out of every angle and can work with the lighting technician to get the best result.
The lighting technician will handle all the lighting duties and work with the director and cameraman to light the scene effectively.






The sound man will be responsible for capturing all the moans, groans, and other sounds involved. He may also help with the soundtrack.
Many films have a stills photographer on site during filming. You can use it for your DVD, website, or as part of other marketing merch.

, Work with the technical crew to plan out each scene, and the most effective order of shooting. Remember, the film doesn't have to be shot in sequence (unless it's a one-act movie), and leave time between scenes for unexpected occurrences—a scene that goes on longer than expected, an actor who doesn't go on as long as he's expected, or other situations that might arise.

, Before you start shooting, make sure your set is ready and everything you need is in place. From the door to the floor to the bedsheets, everything's gotta be ready to go. Create a checklist to complete before you begin shooting. Here are some ideas to get you started:


Set the temperature so that the room is not too hot or too cold.
Lighting is set and tested so that the actors don't lose momentum when it's time to perform.
All wires should be dressed so that they are not visible on camera, and also so they will not trip anybody. Your actors face planting on the edge of the shower isn't in the script this time.
Test the boom mic positioning so that it is not appearing on camera. Did you see Saw V? Your film's going to be better than that.
Make sure all props and toys are where the actors expect them so that a dramatic moment isn't ruined by a missing item. And then you'll have actors on your case, too.






Draw the blinds and lock the doors. You don't want little Timmy from next door wandering in right in the middle of the money shot! Also not in the script. Ever.
Keep snacks, water, soft drinks, and food available for the cast and crew. People get hungry on the set, especially after all that physical exertion. If they have particular (reasonable) requests, honoring them will go a long way towards having a team that enjoys working with you on set.

, Take the time to gather everybody round and make sure people know where they have to be at what times. Set a schedule, including dates and times when each scene will be shot, and which actors will be on call at that time. With everything planned, stage set, and actors at the ready, it's time for that line that transcends genres: ""Lights, camera, action!""


Don't be afraid to yell ""CUT!"" when necessary. If the actors need additional direction, it's your job to make sure they give you what you want. And if a drop of sweat falls into that fruit bowl, even if you're halfway to town, start again. That's what the process is like and that's why you love every second of it.
If you've hired the right actors, they'll be able to get back in position and be ready to go in very short order. Making them stop in the middle of their Oscar-winning performance is part of your job. It's not hindering filmmaking; it's making it better.

, If you've had any level of sexual experience you'll know that failures or issues can, and do, happen. All the time. Especially before the groove has been established. Administer Viagra and lubricant where necessary to maintain the momentum, and remind your actors to smile! Even if they respond with eyes full of loathing.


Be patient. Sometimes a specific shot will take 20 takes. Sometimes you'll need to take breaks in between. Sometimes the sun will go down and you'll still be there, filming a shot that was supposed to happen mid-afternoon. And sometimes those actors won't want to cooperate any longer. That's what makes this a job, after all. But you're the one paying them, so ha! Remind them of that and move on.

, When you're done shooting your film, let everybody know—even any actors that are still lingering off camera, refreshing their eye-make up or practicing their pec flexes in the mirror. Be sure to thank everybody for their efforts, and spend whatever time they would like discussing the film and thoughts they might have. Settle up the financials with anybody who is leaving the project at this point.


Clear the set, leaving it spic and span and smelling of daisies. Then send the crew home and have a meeting with the director to review the shots. You'll need to determine which takes you think are best, and set up an editing schedule with the editor. Who is probably you, by the way. You know how to do that, right?

, If you want to save some serious moolah, the post-production work will be done by you. But if you've got gold bullion stashed in your bathtub, you'll be working with the director and editor to piece together the film, work out transitions between scenes, add titles, music and roll credits. The icing on the cake, really.


If necessary, do voiceovers. It should not be needed if you were able to get good sound during filming, and you want to avoid doing so if possible. It's an exacting process that if done poorly, will be noticeable, and noticeably distracting. But sometimes it's inevitable.






Provide the final version to your sound and add in sound effects, foley, and production music (whether original or canned). You know those cheesy porno riffs. No adult movie is complete without them. Bow chicka wow wow.

, You won't just be emailing the JPEG file to your friends, you know. It's gotta be bundled up and made not just for enjoyment, but for purchase. What formats are you going to sell it in? How are you going to advertise?

This is where your stills will come in handy. If you're sticking to DVDs, it won't be too hard to design a case and piece it together. Now what about Internet ads or your website page? How can you spread the word and generate need?

, Now that you've spent a few thousand dollars to create this film, you want to make it worth the effort and expense. You could just revel in your glory and enjoy it at home, but then the world wouldn't be privy to what it's been waiting for and you'd be more broke than the actors you hired. Here are some options for getting some return on your investment:

Sell it to a subscription website. There are a plethora of porn sites, and much of what's available is free — and the quality of the films reflects the price of entry. Paid sites offer much higher quality, and if your film is done well, may be open to licensing your film. Contact the company and see what they might offer.
Create your own website. Much like self-publishing a book, setting up your own website will let you keep most the profits for yourself. Also like self-publishing a book, though, you will have to build an audience for your site.
Sell it in bulk to sex shops. If you have a full-length DVD, or a DVD's worth of vignettes, you can do a duplication run of a few hundred copies, and offer it to adult stores.
Sell it to magazines that sometimes include a free DVD on the front. Use any contact you have at this point -- maybe even find an agent to help you out.

, Boom! First movie down. It's all cake from here. With your name associated with a good-quality movie, doors can open. Start going to conventions, working on other movies, and meeting people. Low-tier adult movies can be more hassle than their worth, but if you put in the time, you can work your way up and turn it into a legitimate living.


Now that you've seen the process, you may want to pick an aspect and zero in on it. Would you want to be a stills photog? A lighting designer? Writer? Sound op? What part of the process seemed like, well, less of a process? Or maybe you want to take your millions and invest! The world is your oyster.

Review and sign the contract.",How to Buy Film Rights to a Book," Look inside the book and see who is listed as the copyright holder. It should be printed on the opposite side of the title page.


The person who owns the film rights might not be the same person who has the copyright in the book. In fact, many publishers retain these rights. However, the author sometimes keeps them, so you might as well start there.;
, The author might have signed the film rights over to another producer already. The U.S. Copyright Office should have a record if they have been, so search their records at http:https:


You can search both before and after 1978. If the book was published before 1978, you should search both time frames.
You’re out of luck if the author has already assigned film rights to another producer.

, An author might have transferred the film rights recently, so you need to call them up and check.Find the author’s phone number by checking the copyright registration or by contacting the book publisher.

, You might need to negotiate with the author’s agent, especially if the author is well-known. However, independent self-publishers and less known authors frequently don’t have agents. Introduce yourself and explain you want to make a film of their book.

, As a producer, you won’t buy the film rights right off. For example, you probably don’t know if you can even get financing for the project. Instead, you’ll buy an “option,” which gives you the exclusive right to buy the film rights in the future. The option lasts for only a certain amount of time, usually 12-18 months.


Try to get an 18-month option, which will give you extra time to pull together financing for the film.The author might disagree, but you should push to get as lengthy an option period as possible.
You can also get the right to one or two extensions of the original option period.

, You probably need to pay for the option. There’s no formula for how much you should pay, but you should begin by assessing the book’s popularity. A hot bestseller probably has many people bidding, so you might need to offer high five figures or even more.However, a book that’s been out for a while might only cost you $5,000 for the option.
With more obscure books, you might not have to pay any money. Instead, you can promise to do your best to get the film made.Talk to other film producers to see how much they have paid for options.

, This is the amount you will pay for the rights if you ultimately exercise your option. Negotiate this amount at the same time you negotiate the option so that you can include it in your option agreement. Generally, the amount you pay will be based on the written direct budget. The usual formula is 2.5%, and the option price is usually set off against the purchase price.Remember to include a floor and a ceiling. For example, your budget might end up being tiny, which means the author will walk away with peanuts. You can protect against this by setting a minimum, say $7,000.
Also set a maximum amount in case your budget is much higher than you expect.

, Authors typically get around 5-10% of all net profits (and not only the producer’s share).You’ll also need to agree on how to define net profits. There are two standard ways:


The definition used by the picture’s domestic theatrical distributor.
The definition provided by the picture’s financers.

, Think ahead about what other rights you should negotiate at the same time as your option. At a minimum, you’ll want to include the following:


Rights to sequels. You might buy the rights before a book is even published. If it turns out to be a smash hit, then the author will probably create sequels, and a different producer might scoop up the film rights them.
Reversion rights. After you exercise your option, you might hit a snag and not make the film. Authors don’t want to wait around forever, so they want their rights to revert to them. You can set a deadline for getting the film made, such as seven years, and also require the author to reimburse you for expenses., You have many options for crediting an author, and this may be a sticking point for some authors. Consider the following:You give an on-screen credit that reads something like, “Based on the book Poison Ivy written by Michelle Jones.” This credit might have its own screen as part of the opening credits or just be part of the credit roll at the end.
Some authors might also want credit in the paid advertising.
If the author is famous enough, their name might be included in the title of the move, e.g., Sidney Sheldon's Bloodline.

, You need to give the author notice that you’re going ahead and exercising your option to buy the rights. Generally, you can exercise your option by sending the author a written notice or just staring principal photography., Sometimes publishers hold onto the rights of books they publish. Before signing an option agreement, ask the publisher to sign a release. This document will confirm the publisher doesn’t have any rights you are seeking., The producer drafts the contract, so you should work with a lawyer experienced in entertainment law.Get referrals from other producers, or contact your nearest bar association and get a referral. You can find your nearest bar association here: https://shop.americanbar.org/ebus/abagroups/divisionforbarservices/barassociationdirectories/statelocalbarassociations.aspx.


A lawyer will be a big asset when you negotiate, too, so bring them on board early.

, Not all producers can afford a lawyer, so you might need to draft the option agreement yourself. Luckily, the American Bar Association has a sample option purchase agreement here: http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/Forums/entsports/PublicDocuments/imanage_311793_2.authcheckdam.pdf. Use it as a guide when drafting your own.

, Your contract will lay out the terms of your agreement. However, you also want to include warranties from the author. For example, get the author to warranty the following:The book doesn’t infringe any copyrights.
The book doesn’t invade anyone’s privacy.
The book isn’t obscene and doesn’t contain defamatory material.
The author hasn’t sold the film rights to anyone else.

, An injunction is a court order telling you to stop doing something. If you get in a dispute with the author, they can sue for an injunction that prohibits the movie from being distributed. No distributor will touch your movie unless you include a provision telling the author they can only sue you for money compensation., Every contract contains boilerplate provisions that are meant to protect your rights. Make sure your contract contains the following provisions:Merger clause. You want to state that the contract contains the entire agreement and replaces all prior negotiations.
Choice of law provision. If you get in a contract dispute, a judge needs to apply some state’s law to the dispute. You can choose any state’s law, although most people choose the law of the state where they are located.
Partnership provision. Make sure the contract states you are not forming a partnership by signing this agreement.

, Negotiate all main issues before writing your contract. Once finished, let the author and their lawyer/agent review it. If they have major changes, you should discuss them further.


After all parties sign, give a copy of the contract to the author and their agent. Keep your original in a safe place, such as a safe deposit box, or give it to your lawyer to hold onto.

Pay attention to how long each scene lasts, how much action or tension there is during a scene, and how each scene fades seamlessly into the next. Look for visual or sound cues that enhance dramatic rhythm.


Go to your local or school library and check their database for books on film history and film analysis.
Familiarize yourself with the nature of film, primarily by watching everything you can get your hands on. Get a feel for specific directors or editors and what makes their work distinct.
For each television or film production you watch, look online for major newspaper reviews, such as the New York or Los Angeles Times. Reading professional critiques will help you develop your own critical eye.;
, Apply to and enroll in a college film editing program. Your choices include a specialized film school, a four year college or university, or a local community college. Decide what's best for you in terms of affordability and location, and research options that match your needs.


A four year program offers the best preparation for a career in film editing. Check out the list of available majors at your state university system's colleges.If you want to get away from your hometown, look for out-of-state programs. A film school or four year degree from a California- or New York-based school could help you secure better internships and apprenticeships.
Schools near these industry centers can help you develop a stronger network and allow you to be closer to more work opportunities.
A university program will also help you access professional development resources, like publications and calls for entry.
A key perk to film school is access to equipment. Renting equipment can be expensive, but it can be cheaper if you’re a student, especially if you rent through your university program. When you're researching programs, ask about their available equipment and rental procedures.

, Your coursework will include basic editing and commercial editing, film history, storytelling, and screenwriting. In addition, you will learn how to use photo and film editing software programs like Adobe Premiere and Final Cut Pro (FCP). FCP is the Hollywood standard for film editing, and you'll need to take software-heavy courses that'll allow you to master it.Go for a course load heavy in technology and software training. Film editors don't manually cut film anymore, so it's important to have a strong foundation in both established and emerging tech and programs.Even after you've graduated, it's common for editors to continue their education by occasionally taking formal courses. This helps to stay up to date with the industry's technological changes., Hone your skills when you’re just starting out or in school by editing smaller projects. Work with your friends or with peers at university. Start out with independent editing projects to put your education into practice, and edit as many short films as possible.Use your university years as an opportunity to start growing your network by working with your peers and seeking out mentors among your professors.
Collaborative amateur projects are important when you're starting out, especially in today's industry environment. Working with others is a highly prized skill, so collaborating early on will help you further down the road.Even making silly videos, putting projects on Youtube, and other small spare-time endeavors will help you exercise your editing muscles and put theoretical knowledge into practice.

, While a film school education can give you a knowledge base and technical foundation, it’s essential to build concrete experience. The more tangible experience you have, the better your chances of getting your foot in the door in the world of film editing. Start out small by looking for smaller, local productions or by continuing to collaborate with peers you’ve met along the way.


You can look online for local production job and gig listingsWord of mouth is key for getting gigs, whether paid or unpaid, and at both amateur and professional levels.

, In addition to volunteering your time on local productions, you’ll likely have to continue paying your dues and working for free for a considerable portion of your early career. Networking is key throughout the process, and you’ll have to rely on your growing network to land an apprenticeship with a major production company. Even though it’s free labor, apprenticing or interning will help you demonstrate that you possess actual skills and a solid work ethic.Consult your professors and try to access their networks while you’re in school. This will help you to land good internships or apprenticeships, both while you’re in college and when you’re breaking into the field after graduating.
You might have to take several apprentice jobs before you actually start to make a modest income.
Treat every job as if you’re getting a million-dollar income. Prove that you have a great work ethic and are a pleasure to work with.

, Those with whom you’ve apprenticed or interned will be essential for getting a paying job, whether they connect you with one or offer you a strong recommendation. You're unlikely to land a job in editing right away, even if you have strong apprentice gigs under your belt. Take any job that comes along, whether it's as a tour guide on a studio lot, a personal assistant to somebody on a film crew, a secretary at the office, or a runner for a production.

, Be polite to everybody you meet and promote yourself. Hand out business cards with links to your website and reel. Make it known that you're looking as a job as a film editor. Building your network of connections this way can lead to unexpected chances, like becoming a film editor on a short that later wins an award at a festival.If you meet people who work in the editing room, ask if you may occasionally join them to observe and learn.
It might take up to ten years before you’ve built a robust enough network and record of on the job training to land a job with a reasonable income, so be persistent., One of the easiest and most effective ways to build your body of work is to create your own business. Invest in cards and other marketing materials to make yourself professional and competitive. Starting an editing service with a skilled peer is also wise in the current market, as collaborative skills are desirable in the industry nowadays.When you're starting out, you find it necessary to branch out beyond your specialized field in order to build clientele.
Consider getting in touch with local or emerging musicians about producing music videos for them. Be open to trade and bartering for compensation.Wedding or graduation videos, commercial marketing for restaurants and other local businesses, and producing corporate training videos are other examples of some avenues to take when you're starting your own business., Be strategic about how you build your body of work. Put your best effort into making each production you work on more legitimate than the last, and be sure to make long-lasting contacts with every job. Even shorts and low budget movies can get a listing on the IMDB, as long as the productions were released. Potential employers will refer to it before hiring you.The IMBD staff updates its listing regularly and selects films, television series and specials, commercials, music videos, and local or public access television shows for inclusion in its database.
Register on the IMBD website and submit your individual credit or project's title to verify or correct its listing., Once you’ve built up your body of work, design a winning portfolio to market yourself successfully. You’ll find that the applicant pool for editing jobs is intensely competitive, so you have to make yourself stand out. Send out your resume, along with a reel of your best work, to studio executives, directors, and other film editors. Make sure the materials you submit in applications are concise and show off only your best work.

Look the part.,
Practice and prepare yourself.,
Go with others.,
Figure out your escape plan.",How to Sneak Into an R Rated Movie1," Dress like you would if you were the right age to see the movie. (Girls, don't overdo it.) Don't wear high school logos on clothes (college and university logos are great, though - if you look like a college student, people automatically assume you're at least 17 or older). Guys - if you can grow a little facial hair, don't shave two days before the movie so you look older. Also, try to lower your voice to an older-sounding tone.

, Figure out what you're doing ahead of time. Practice your lines at home so you're comfortable saying them. For example, if you look over 17, pick a fake birthday ahead of time. The easiest way to catch someone lying about their age is by asking them about their birthday. If you stutter trying to think of a valid birthday, they won't let you in. If you look like you're 18, say your birthday was today and you left your ID at home.

, If you can, go with friends that are over 17. It makes it less obvious that you're under 17. Going with a friend might make it a bit less nerve racking if it is your first time sneaking in, and if you do get caught you're not alone.

, If you get caught sneaking in, don't panic! Make an excuse such as, ""Oh, my parents are in there, I just had to go to the bathroom"". Sound realistic when you do. If you get caught doing the movie switching method, a good excuse is ""Oh, sorry! I guess I got the wrong entrance."" You might want to look around while saying it to make it more realistic. Never run away if you get caught. That will not only anger whoever it is that chases you down, but also draws even more attention...possibly an ill-mannered manager. While making an excuse can save you from being caught, running immediately makes you look guilty and will have you kicked out of the theater.

Use the restrooms beforehand.,
Make sure that your seat is comfortable and that you're not bothered by the people around you.,
Use proper manners.,
Turn off all pagers/beepers, cellphones, and other electronic devices during the previews.,
Resist the urge to make trouble.,
Enjoy the movie.",How to Stay Quiet During a Movie," Try to use it after you get your ticket, but before you step inside the theater room. Doing this after you get your seat will may force you to step in front of others that are around you to get to the aisles, and also on the way back to your seat.;
, If you have a tendency to get up for a reason every so often, try choose a seat next to the aisle for more convenience. If you wish to see the movie at the best angle, go with a seat that is in the middle of the room or on the highest rise. To avoid people's heads being in your way, pick a seat closer to the screen on a lower rise.

, Don't chomp on popcorn or slurp on your soda. Also, be courteous to others as the movies isn't your house. Feet should stay on the ground instead of using the seat in front of you as a footstool. It may be a cool thing for teenagers to do, but it's frowned upon.

, Some theaters will have reminders on the screen before starting the previews.


Avoid using electronic devices during the movie. Cellphone faces tend to illuminate light on the faceplate that can be seen a few rises up. It is inconsiderate to be talking while the movie is in session. If it's an emergency or an important call, please take the call in the main lobby. Otherwise, wait until the movie has ended.

, Distraction takes away the enjoyment of the movie from others. If you can't help it, it's best to remove yourself from the theater room and find something else to do, for example spending time in an arcade.

, You paid to see it, so have fun. Comedy films are supposed to make people smile or laugh and horror movies are created for people to jump in their seats.

Get an older sibling or friend to buy a ticket and go inside the theatre.

,
There is usually an exit near the movie theater (not inside the theater) that does not have a handle on the outside but is used to exit instead of having to go through the lobby.",How to Sneak Into an R Rated Movie4,", Have your person open the door from the inside and let you in. If there are people around before you go in, smoke or talk on the phone, acting like you had only left for a brief moment. It's good to carry an old ticket from a previous movie you saw so that if a bystander questions you, you can just flash them the ticket and say you just went out for a smoke/call.

You will learn techniques and also make connections in the film industry through your professors and classmates. You will also get a chance to make a film, and you’ll have the school’s equipment at your disposal.Check your local community college to see if any film classes are offered.;
, The time you’ll spend actually shooting the film is minimal compared to the time you’ll spend researching, writing, and planning your film. Taking classes in writing can help you learn how to make a successful documentary that will be organized and also captivate your viewers.Graphic design classes may also be helpful, as your film will need to be edited with software after shooting.

, It’s important to know what kind of documentaries are already out there. You don’t want to spend months making a film about something only to discover there are several documentaries already out there featuring the same thing. While you watch documentaries, ask yourself questions like:Why is this documentary successful (or not)?
How does the cinematography affect the experience?
How do I, as a viewer, connect to the film?
How does watching this documentary make me feel?

, You should keep your knowledge current regarding the documentary industry. Subscribe to several trade publications and check out websites that feature documentary filmmakers.You can also read books about documentary filmmaking to gain knowledge on the subject.

, Research documentary filmmakers and find out as much as you can. Learn what makes them successful, and find out how they got their start in the industry. This will also help you get to know your competition., You should try to get to know other people in the documentary filmmaking business. Ask friends and classmates if they know anyone in the film industry, and do research on the internet. Attend filmmaking festivals or contests, and get to know film teachers in your area., Nothing can compare to actually working on a film crew and helping make a documentary. It’s a great idea to work on a few documentaries before making your own. You can gain invaluable knowledge by watching someone else. Pay attention to the details to learn how to create a budget, cast roles for a movie, organize your film, shoot scenes, and even edit and market films.

, Is your purpose to shed light on something important to you, or is it to produce an entertaining product? Both are excellent reasons to produce a documentary, but they are very different. If you lean more towards the first, then it is more important to focus on the content rather than the composition. However, for the latter you might focus more on cinematography and sound.

, Your idea should ultimately be of interest to other people as well, as you will want viewers for your documentary. A good topic is one that you can develop into a moving or entertaining story.


For example, if you are passionate about animal rights, you could make a documentary about treatment of animals in zoos and circuses.
Alternatively, if you’re interested in social commentary, you could make a documentary about the effect of degenerative diseases, like Alzheimer’s, on patients and their families.

, You’ll need to plan your film down to the smallest detail, so decide who you need to interview, where you need to go, how you will convey you story, and when you will film, edit, finish, etc. A good plan will mean a better film. If you know the logistics of when and where all your shots will be taken, you will produce a smoother and more professional product., It is very important to create a storyboard to help keep you on track. A storyboard is a series of illustrations that show the breakdown of the documentary. Key scenes are depicted, as are details such as how the setting will look, who will be in the scene, and what will happen.

, At the very least, you’ll need a good camera and microphones. Invest in a quality camera, but don’t worry about getting one that is top of the line. You can upgrade later, but for now you just need something to shoot scenes with., It’s nearly impossible to create a documentary all by yourself. You will at least need a subject for your film, and likely a scriptwriter, director, producer, camera operator, gaffer (in charge of lighting), boom mic operator, and editor.

, Once you have a plan for you documentary, the proper equipment, and a film crew, you are ready to begin filming your documentary. Set a specific shooting schedule, and be sure to stick to it. Organization is key for getting your film completed and keeping your crew happy.

, This is an important step, as the finished product comes after a lot of work editing the documentary. You can do this yourself, or choose someone else to edit your film. There is software available, like Final Cut and Adobe Premier Pro, to help you make the best documentary possible.

, Submitting your documentary to a local festival is the best way to start. Ask your local library or auditorium if you can show your film, then invite as many people as you can to watch it. You can also sign up for documentary filmmaking contests and post your film on social media and sites like YouTube and Vimeo.

Do your research.,
Listen to the music carefully and decide what it sounds most like.

",How to Know Your Music Genres1," Do research on genres. Don't simply believe whatever the media says it is, online users say it is or what others say it is. Some genres have been around longer than people think and they may bash a genre but then listen to a band that goes under the genre they bashed without awareness. You can use sites such as about.com, allmusic.com or search some articles on Google. Wikipedia is okay to do it, but be aware that anyone can edit it, therefore, Wikipedia isn't always meant to be trusted. Urban Dictionary is not recommended. Anyone can post their view on a definition and they'll often get it wrong.;

"
Realize that just because a band is mostly playing a certain genre of music, doesn't mean they have always played it.,
Don't simply listen to what others will say.,
Do NOT ever determine a genre by the artist's look, popularity, fan-base, etc.,
Don't confuse certain genres as certain things they aren't.",How to Know Your Music Genres2," For example, My Chemical Romance is famous for being a pop punk band. However, their first album is completely different from all their other records and, believe it or not, sounds more like old-school emo music than pop punk. You'll notice a lot of characteristics of hardcore punk or bands like Rites of Spring in songs like ""Our Lady of Sorrows"" and a lot of characteristics of indie-emo bands like Sunny Day Real Estate, Texas is the Reason and American Football. Not very many people know their debut, and its songs don't have that many views on YouTube.

, Many people tend to get their genres wrong.

, It is the MUSIC that matters. These things have NOTHING to do with the music. For example, just because a band has hair fringes, tight jeans, studded belts, etc doesn't mean they're an emo band. Just because a band has big, long, sprayed hair, bright makeup and lipstick, painted nails, spandex, etc doesn't mean they're glam metal. Some people might say that a certain genre must be underground. For example, some purists say that punk rock can't be popular. But ironically, punk bands like The Ramones,The Clashand The Sex Pistolswere mainstream and still are famous. Even Jawbreaker, an emo/punk band signed to major label Geffen Records. Some say that emo can't be mainstream. However, that's ironic because it is a genre of music, not a popularity contestant. Thus, only the music counts. Even bands like The Get-Up Kidsand Jimmy Eat Worldwere mainstream in the late 1990s and early 2000s and were really famous. Even Sunny Day Real Estate have appeared on an episode on the extremely famous show Late Night With Jimmy Fallonand an episode of the international TV show South Park.Some say emo can't be on TV, but ironically, bands like Sunny Day Real Estate,The Get Up Kidsand The Promise Ringhave been on MTV and Sunny Day Real Estate have been on VH1.

, For example, some people say the music genre pop is short for Popular. But it isn't. If that was true, then bands like Suicide Silence and Avenged Sevenfold, who have as many views as Austin Mahone, Cody Simpson and Paramore, would be considered pop. The metal band Pantera were mainstream in 1990s and they should be tagged as metal, not pop. It sounds like they'd call a death metal band pop if the band had over trillions of fans. Pop is just what was considered extremely catchy, and often upbeat music. The genre has been around since the 1940s and 1950s and 1940s/1950s pop is underground nowadays. One of the most biggest traits of pop music since the 1950s is the pop song. Pop music is not usually written, done and recorded as a symphony, suite, or concerto. The major form for pop music is the song and usually a song consisting of verse and repeated chorus. Usually the songs are between 2.5 minutes and 5.5 minutes in length. There have been exceptions. The Beatles' ""Hey Jude"" was a 7 minutes in length song. Although, in many cases, if the song is very long, an edited version is made for radio airplay like in the case of Don McLean's ""American Pie."" It was changed from its original 8.5 minutes length to over 4 minutes for radio airplay. On the other end of the spectrum, in the late 1950s and early 1960s some famous songs were under 2 minutes instead."

Dive into heavy rock, hard rock, and metal.",How to Know Your Music Genres3," Be sure to learn about their history and influences. Here are some genres that have certain bands and artists mislabeled as:,


Screamo - A subgenre of emo music which is influenced a lot by hardcore punk and has screaming in it sometimes. It was started by bands like Heroin, Mohinder and Antiotch Arrow.Bands - I Hate Myself, Saetia, Pg. 99, Heroin, Antiotch Arrow, Raein, The Saddest Landscape, Reversal of Man
Mislabeled as screamo: Screamo has been confused with metal, death metal, metalcore and deathcore or just simply heavy music with screaming or growling. Bands mislabeled as screamo include Cannibal Corpse, Children of Bodom, Lamb of God, Asking Alexandria, Falling in Reverse, Pierce the Veil, Black Veil Brides, I See Stars and Motionless in White.






Emo pop - Was made in the 1990s regeneration of emo. One side of the regeneration was indie-emo bands like Sunny Day Real Estate, Dashboard Confessional and Braid, while the other was the pop punk-emo bands such as The Movielife,The Get Up Kids,and Jimmy Eat World.These bands remade emo to sound less punk and more like indie rock or pop punk. Later emo pop bands were bands like Fall Out Boy. Some emo purists reject emo pop as ""real emo"", but then call The Get Up Kids emo when they obviously are pop punk which you can hear in songs like ""Holiday"", ""I'm a Loner Dottie, I'm a Rebel"" and ""Forgive & Forget"". The Promise Ring, an indie-emo band, played emo popwith their third album from 1999. A song like ""Emergency! Emergency!"" shows an example of this.
Emo - A style of post-hardcore which began in the 1980s characterized by its emotional lyrics and punk rock traits with bands like Rites of Spring. In the 1990s, it was remade for a more indie rock (Sunny Day Real Estate, American Football, Dashboard Confessional, Braid) or pop punk (The Get Up Kids, Jimmy Eat World) sound.Today, bands like Black Veil Brides, Suicide Silence, Asking Alexandria, Pierce the Veil, Cannibal Corpse, Hopes Die Last, Motionless in White, etc are being mislabeled as emo by the media.
Emo bands - Thursday, Rites of Spring, The Pine, Saetia, Sunny Day Real Estate, Silverstein

,


Pop punk - A style of music which blended pop rock with punk rock. Some bands who are simply normal punk rock with casual lyrics get mislabeled under this style. Before the genre got big, bands like The Descendants,Screeching Weasel, The Queers, Jawbreaker, Social Distortion, NoFX, Rancid,Buzzcocks, etc got called pop punk for being non-political bands with more casual lyrics.The most famous band in this group's Green Day,which is why they always get compared to bands like New Found Glory, Good Charlotte, etc when they sound nothing alike. However, Green Day has played pop punk before, but their old stuff was punk rock. One band called MxPx gets mislabeled often as pop punk and more skate punk. However, they did go through a major pop punk phase for years from around 1999 to the middle of the 2000s, but then returned to their roots. Their pop punk stuff is their most popular, which is why this might be true. Bands such as Hawthorne Heights, Senses Fail, The Used, Silverstein, etc have been called pop punk by emo purists, even though they sound nothing like pop punk. Bands in pop punk include Sum 41, New Found Glory, Bowling For Soup, McFly, The Ataris, The Get Up Kids, Lit, Blink-182, Jawbreaker, Bodyjar, Bouncing Souls, Millencolin, Good Charlotte and Simple Plan.

,


Post-hardcore - A style of punk, hardcore and alternative rock. It originally was traced back into the 1980s when hardcore punk bands expanded their sound and made it more experimental. Later bands would sound very alternative rock mixed with punk. Some bands were even influenced by post-punk. Genres like math rock, progressive rock, noise rock, jazz fusion, indie rock, reggae and funk have influenced post-hardcore often.Many people today aren't aware of this, but bands like Hüsker Dü, Fugazi and The Minutemen were the first to be called post-hardcore. In the 1990s, it was bands like Hot Water Music and At the Drive In. Today's bands include Senses Fail, Aiden, The Sleeping and Small Brown Bike. Alesana and Blessthefall's early stuff has been mislabeled as metalcore, but isn't metalcore because it doesn't have any metal traits (screaming doesn't count as metal all the time). Blessthefall did later go metalcore though. But their early work was influenced a lot by emo, indie rock, hardcore and post-hardcore. They were some of the heaviest post-hardcore bands. Today, many bands who are actually metalcore/electronicore/melodic metalcore are being mislabeled as post-hardcore. Bands like Asking Alexandria, Bring Me the Horizon, I See Stars, The Devil Wears Prada, Make Me Famous, Of Mice & Men, etc aren't post-hardcore. Bands like Fugazi, At the Drive In, Gray Matter, Dag Nasty, Glassjaw, Senses Fail, The Sleeping, Glassjaw, The Blood Brothers, etc are post-hardcore.
Hardcore (short for hardcore punk) - A subgenre of punk rock which was fast and had less melodic vocals, including yelling.Because it influenced many -core genres like metalcore, electronicore, deathcore and such, bands under those genres have been mislabeled as hardcore bands. Asking Alexandria, Of Mice & Men and August Burns Red aren't hardcore bands. Many people will say they hate metalcore but then will take off listening to bands like Hatebreed, Converge, Integrity, etc when they are metalcore bands, but these people mislabel them as hardcore bands. It could be because they are influenced by hardcore, their concerts have slam dancing, or because of their look. Although in the 1980s, most hardcore bands opposed the punk fashion (spiky hair, hair dye, black clothes and leather jackets, studs, skinny jeans, etc), they ended up looking like average joes because they dressed how they want instead of simply dressing punk to fit in, which proved that punk wasn't about the look. In the 1990s, when the hardcore subgenre tough guy hardcore (or beatdown), which was more abrasive, heavier, down-tuned and had low-chugging breakdowns, was made with bands like Madball, Death Before Dishonor and Youth for Today, these bands (Agnostic Front even joined them) would play a heavier hardcore style (which was confused with metalcore) and they tended to have a look of buzz cuts, baseball caps, gauges, black hoodies, tattoos and crossing arms in photos. As a contradiction to hardcore's original view on fashion, people made their idea of the hardcore look by wearing black hoodies, baseball caps, crew cuts and tattoos. See metalcore


,






Crunkcore - A subgenre of crunk (Lil Jon, Soulja Boy) and electropop (Ke$ha, Blood on the Dance Floor). It has been stereotyped a lot with having screams used a little bit. Crunkcore songs might have screaming used a little bit in the song.However, not all crunkcore has screaming. For example, Brokencyde's song ""My Gurl"" and their third album has an absence of screaming, ""obSCENE"" by Scene Kidz doesn't have screaming and 3OH!3 don't really scream. Crunkcore mixes the genre crunk with electropop music. Brokencyde, 3OH!3, JJ Demon and Dot Dot Curve are examples of crunkcore. However, some groups and artists have been mislabeled as crunkcore. For example, Blood on the Dance Floor has been called crunkcore because some of their songs have a tiny bit of screaming in it. Most of their songs don't have screaming though. But they don't have any crunk characteristics and are actually dance-pop. Some people consider Hollywood Undead crunkcore but they don't have any electropop characteristics and are actually more rap rock. Some people say crunkcore is a rap rock genre, but in reality it isn't and crunkcore music doesn't even have guitars in it.
Scene - Not a genre of music. Just a term for people who listen to stuff like Brokencyde or Jeffree Star and dress like those guys from Brokencyde or The Millionaires. Genres like deathcore have been called scene because of bands like Design the Skyline and We Butter the Bread With Butter, but deathcore bands aren't scene and bands like Emmure, Despised Icon, Annotations of an Autopsy, All Shall Perish and Whitechapel are proof. Death metal fuses death metal with metalcore and metalcore fuses metal with hardcore punk. Punk and metal have nothing to do with scene and neither does rock music. ""Scene"" music would be Owl City, 3OH!3 or Brokencyde.

,


Glam metal/hair metal - a subgenre of either hard rock or heavy metal which had catchy, repetitive choruses, upbeat pop melodies, hard rock or heavy metal riffs and solos and lyrics typically about love, lust or anything used in pop lyrics. Because some bands would wear bright makeup, red or pink lipstick, big, long hair and stuff, glam metal was confused consistently as a fashion and bands would sometimes be mislabeled glam metal for their look.Bands like Mötley Crüe, Poison, Dokken, Faster Pussycat, Ratt and Quiet Riot are glam metal bands. Here are some bands confused as glam metal:
Guns 'N Roses - Are actually more of hard rock
KISS - They only were glam metal from 1983-1989, their other stuff is more of shock rock.
Skid Row - Only played glam metal on their self-titled debut, all subsequent material is just heavy metal.
Twisted Sister - Are obviously more of just metal. They only are called glam metal for their look, although they don't wear makeup anymore. However, their look is actually more shock rock than glam, and their music doesn't sound much like glam metal at all. Here are some reasons: They aren't all poppy and upbeat like glam metal is, they sound more like artists like Judas Priest, Ozzy Osbourne and Motörhead, they don't have any lyrics about love, lust, etc and have lyrics that are the opposite of friendly or romantic such as rebellion, rock n roll and violence.Not only that, even Metallica were always fans of Twisted Sister, and even Overkill and Anthrax like Twisted Sister and covered the band's music. Even on Metal Archives, they don't call Twisted Sister glam metal. Dee Snider even spoke against the thing in the 1980s where glam metal bands would constantly do ballads and accused them of selling out. If you listen to songs like ""You Can't Stop Rock 'N Roll"", ""Under the Blade"" and ""Burn in Hell"", they don't sound anything like bands like Poison or Warrant. They also would rather be called ""Hid-metal"" than glam metal, according to Dee Snider. Whitesnake - They were only glam metal on their two late 80s albums, all other material is hard rock.
Nu metal - A style of rock music which mixed groove metal/alternative metal with hip-hop and had down-tuned guitars and sometimes influences from 1990s alternative and grunge. Bands would have hip-hop rhythms, down-tuned guitars, heavy riffs and vocals ranging from rapping, yelling, growls and singing.Bands like Korn, Slipknot (old stuff), Coal Chamber, Limp Bizkit, Deftones (early work), OTEP and Papa Roach and Linkin Park are nu metal bands. Bands like System of a Down, Nothingface, etc get called nu metal but aren't because they have no hip-hop traits and are more alternative metal. Nu metal isn't to be confused with rap metal, which is a combination of rap and traditional heavy metal which doesn't have down-tuned guitars a lot in it. Not all nu metal has rapping though. Some people argue the Deftones aren't nu metal. However, their early work is nu metal because you can obviously tell if you listen to songs like Engine No. 9 and 7 Words.
Alternative metal - For some reason, some bands such as Avenged Sevenfold, Atreyu, Escape the Fate, etc have been called alternative metal. But in reality, bands like Tool, Nothingface, Mudvayne, Helmet, Drowning Pool, Godsmack, Fear Disorder, Alice in Chains, etc are alternative metal.
Metalcore - Many people aren't aware of this, but metalcore wasn't always about doing clean vocals then screams and growls, because even metal bands have done this. Cradle of Filth's ""Lilith Immaculate"", Nothingface, Anaal Nathrakh's ""Paragon Pariah"", and Testament's recent stuff have done this type of vocal style. Metalcore has, believe it or not, been around since the early 1990s and 1989. Because bands like Integrity, Earth Crisis and Converge mixed metal with the tough guy hardcore style, they were called metalcore bands first. Tough guy hardcore is hardcore punk only much more abrasive and heavier with down-tuned guitars and some slow passages or breakdowns. It's alike to traditional metalcore, but metalcore is heavier and has metal characteristics. Metalcore has been shortened for metallic hardcore with bands like Hatebreed, Converge, Earth Crisis and Shai Hulud. Later bands such as Killswitch Engage, Avenged Sevenfold, As I Lay Dying, changed metalcore and because they were the most famous of metalcore, people haven't been aware of what metalcore originally was.Many people might call bands who do clean singing then screams and growls ""metalcore"" when they aren't. Here are some bands who have been mislabeled as metalcore by at least a few people. Some of these bands are extremely far from metalcore:

Senses Fail - Emo (There obviously is no way that these guys are metalcore in any way. It would be making you wonder how they got called metalcore.)
Alesana - Post-hardcore (Not that Fugazi or At the Drive In post-hardcore. These guys don't have any metal characteristics. They are influenced by hardcore, emo, screamo indie and post-hardcore. They may have metal influences, but that doesn't make them metalcore.)
From First to Last - emo (Not even close to metalcore)
Five Finger Death Punch - Groove metal
In Flames - Melodic death metal/Swedish metal

, Tap on the green “Install” button on the right side of the SoundHound app page. A small pop-up window will then appear asking you to grant the app all the necessary permissions for it to run. Tap on the “Accept” button if you are amenable.


Wait more or less one minute for SoundHound to download and be automatically installed. A “Successfully installed” message will then appear on your screen once SoundHound is ready. The app icon will then show both on your device’s home screen and apps menu.







, Tap on SoundHound’s app icon either from the home screen or app drawer to launch and open the app interface.


To use SoundHound, make sure your Internet data or Wi-Fi connection is switched on.

, Once SoundHound is open, an orange rectangular button with “What’s That Song?” and “Tap Here” written on it will appear on your Android screen. Tap on it.

, Once you see “Listening” displayed on your device’s screen, it means SoundHound can now detect sound and is ready to identify music. Hold your Android device towards the music or song you want to identify. Within seconds, you will see the name of the track, its singer, movie/album, and other such information on your Android screen.


If SoundHound fails to recognize the song and comes back with an error message, just click on the orange “Search Again” button. It might help if you get closer to the source of the music.

Keep your technology away from moisture sources.",How to Listen to Music While Showering," You can find these at most general retailers, technology stores, and similar stores. Once you do, you can keep your phone somewhere dry in the bathroom and connect it to the speaker in the shower. Start a playlist on your phone to play music in the shower on the speaker.


In some cases, you may be able to find speakers equipped with suction cups to make the speaker more stable in the shower.
Some speakers may have waterproof straps you can use to hang the speaker from the shower curtain rod.
Read the description of your waterproof speakers carefully. Some may be fully splash resistant, but unable to be immersed in water.;
, Some phones have cases that are naturally resistant to water. Some may even be safe to take in shallow water, though check your phone’s detailed manual description before attempting this. In some cases, certain “waterproof” phones may only be spill or splash resistant.


Some phones are actually marketed for their usefulness as music players in the shower. Some of these you might consider include the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7 Plus, the Caterpillar Cat S60, and more., These are many times a cheaper alternative than waterproof Bluetooth speakers or a waterproof phone. Even though you won’t be able to use playlists saved to your mobile device, you’ll still be able to enjoy the tunes broadcast by your favorite radio station while showering.


Some of these shower radios also have the ability to pair to your phone with Bluetooth or an AUX cord connection to turn the radio into a speaker.
Some bathrooms may get poor reception due to the interference of walls, piping, and more. Because of this, you’ll likely want to prioritize radios that are highly rated for their reception., If you rise earlier than others in your household, you might not be able to rock the tunes on high volumes through a speaker. In this case, you might make use of a waterproof MP3 player and waterproof headphones. This way, you can listen to your favorite music at whatever volume you desire while enjoying your shower.


Three models you may want to consider if a waterproof MP3 sounds like it might suit your needs are: Sony's Walkman NWZ-W273S, the Speedo AquaBeat 2, and the KitSound Triathlon., Many waterproof cases claim to be 100% waterproof. While these very well may limit the majority of moisture from coming into contact with your phone, it’s not uncommon for trace amounts of water to enter the case. For this reason, you should use a waterproof case as added protection for your technology, but try to avoid exposing these to moisture.


Read the label description of potential “waterproof” cases you’re considering buying. In some cases, these may only be water resistant and not able to be dunked in water.

, In some cases, you might not have time to set up speakers in your bathroom. In other cases, setting up speakers might not be worth the effort. You don’t need speakers to listen to music while showering. However, if you do plan on using speakers, select durable, small- to mid-sized speakers.


Large speakers will create more volume and will be the easiest for you to hear over the sound of the shower running. However, these tend to be more delicate, and will likely be more sensitive to steam.
Speakers that can be oriented to broadcast music directly at the shower should be prioritized. These kinds of speaker will be easier to hear over the running water.

, If you’re playing music straight from your phone without external speakers, it may be difficult to hear the music. It’s a good thing you can create an emergency amplifier by inserting the speaker end of your phone into a cup or glass.


You may want to try several different glasses, as the shape of the glass will influence the application effect.
Generally, you can expect wide-mouthed glasses or bowls to produce richer, fuller, deeper sound than small-mouthed glasses., The more you focus the sound of your phone and (potentially) your speakers on the shower, the easier it’ll be for you to hear the music over the sound of the water. If you made a cup-amplifier, you may be able to hear the music best from the shower if you angle the mouth of the cup to face the shower.


Water can sometimes spray through gaps in the curtain, especially after you enter the shower. Take extra care to keep your equipment from getting unnecessarily wet. Generally, moisture is bad for electronics.
The acoustics of your bathroom may also influence the best placement of your audio equipment. Generally, sound waves spread through a room, bouncing off hard surfaces and being absorbed by soft ones. The more concentrated these waves, the easier to hear they are. Angle speakers and cup-amplifiers to emit sound at your shower area.

, When you’re in the shower, especially if you don’t have the benefit of having a waterproof phone, it may be impossible to skip a bad song. Wet hands can get damaging moisture on your phone, so instead, consider setting a rockin’ playlist of your own ahead of time so you aren’t tempted to use your phone while wet.


If you absolutely must change the song while you’re in the shower, try to use the voice activation feature of your phone to prevent getting your phone wet. Speak clearly and distinctly; it may be difficult for the voice recognition software to recognize your voice over the shower.
Even your favorite songs can become old after a while. Why not come up with many different shower playlists that capture common feelings you have? For example, you might have a playlist for encouraging yourself, one for focusing on work, one for puzzling out a difficult problem, and so on.

, Pair your phone to or plug in the AUX cable for your speaker if necessary. Start your playlist on your phone, and if using the cup-amplifier, insert your phone into the cup. Turn volume up fully, then hop in the shower and enjoy music as you get clean.

, There may be some cases when you’re away from home and in dire need of some tunes while showering. Take a re-sealable plastic baggie, insert your phone into it, and seal the baggie. Then use a durable waterproof tape, like duct tape, to reinforce the seal of the baggie.Even if you lack a suitable waterproof tape, so long as you’re careful to keep the sealable part of the baggie closed, your phone should be protected from water.
Some plastic baggies will be thin enough for your phone to read your taps and swipes. It may take you some time to find the best plastic baggie for your phone., Moisture can build up in the air and saturate the enclosed atmosphere of your bathroom. When the air becomes saturated, moisture has a tendency to work its way into even well protected cases. You can prevent the buildup of air moisture by turning on a fan before showering and running it for the duration of your shower.


If your bathroom doesn’t have a fan, you might want to crack a window or leave your door propped slightly open to give moisture an escape point.

, Certain parts of your bathroom may accumulate water more easily than others. In some cases, you may have noticed that some places seem to be wet every time you take a shower. These are spots that should be avoided when setting up and positioning your technology.

Work closely with your lawyer.",How to Hire a Music Attorney," Different attorneys have different specialties and you need to hire one that understands and feels comfortable with your legal issue. Before you start your attorney search, think about the legal problem you have. Are you about to sign a record deal and you want someone to look over a contract? Do you have questions about how to legally sample music? Are you being sued, or are you suing, for copyright infringement? Each of these legal issues involves a different area of the law.


If you have a contracts question, you will want to hire a transactional contracts attorney. However, if you are in a contracts dispute, you may need to hire a trial lawyer as opposed to a transactional one. In general, transactional attorneys draft and execute documents while trial lawyers handle disputes.
If you have a copyright question, you will want to hire an established intellectual property attorney. Intellectual property attorneys work with copyrights, patents, and trademarks all the time and will be able to help you with your issue.;
, To start your attorney search, you should get as many referrals as you can. One good source of referrals is other musicians. Ask them if they would recommend their lawyer and ask why. If the lawyer sounds like a good fit, then write down the lawyer’s name.


Also ask musicians about the attorney’s fees.You probably won’t know initially what is considered a high fee, so don’t discount someone right off the bat if the fee sounds high.

, You should also get the opinion of other people such as music managers and people who work for record labels. They are probably familiar with music attorneys and can give you some names.


Don’t hire someone simply because a record label recommends the person.For example, you might have received a recording contract from a record label. The label then tells you to go meet with a certain lawyer to discuss the contract. Instead of hiring this lawyer automatically, you should always conduct your own attorney research to reach a conclusion.

, A “bar association” is an organization made up of attorneys. Most bar associations also run referral services, where you contact the bar association and they refer you to one or more lawyers.


You can find your nearest bar association by visiting the American Bar Association’s website. Click on your state., You can also get the names of music attorneys by looking in music business directories, such as the Recording Industry Sourcebook. Some magazines, such as Music Connection, also print directories of music attorneys.You might also be able to find lawyers who will work pro bono. For example, the Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts in New York City maintains a directory of organizations that provide legal advice to low-income musicians., You can also connect with lawyers at music conferences, e.g., SXSW. One advantage of meeting lawyers in a social setting is that you can tell right off whether you connect with the lawyer.


Attend panels where lawyers are speaking and participate in different “mentoring sessions” that conference attendees can sign up for.If you like a lawyer, briefly explain that you are looking for a lawyer and get a business card.

, Lawyers today should have websites. You can find the website by typing in the lawyer’s name and their location. As you look at the website, pay attention to the following:


Does anybody work alongside the lawyer? A lawyer who works in a larger firm with other attorneys can often provide more services for clients. However, a lawyer who works in a smaller firm can provide more individual attention.Is the website neat? Does it look professional or amateurish? Are there typos and grammatical errors? A lawyer who doesn’t take the time to create a professional website might not be careful when representing you.

, Lawyers should also list their experience on the website. Check to see how much music industry experience they have. Look for representative legal matters listed. Does the lawyer handle mostly music contracts? Or has the lawyer done a variety of work for musicians?


Also check the website to see how much of the lawyer’s practice is devoted to musicians. Some lawyers might specialize in music matters while others do a variety of work.

, There are many websites where clients can post reviews. For example, reviews can be posted on Google+, Yelp, Yahoo, and Avvo. You can find these reviews by typing in the lawyer’s name and city into an Internet search engine.


Avvo is a site dedicated to the review of attorneys.Therefore, it can be a great place to analyze attorney reviews. A majority of lawyers who are hired by the public will maintain and check their Avvo profile regularly.
Take online reviews with a grain of salt. For one thing, anyone can post a review online. For another, people who are disgruntled tend to be more motivated to leave a negative review than a person who had a positive experience.
Nevertheless, you should look for patterns. For example, if several people complain that the lawyer is hard to get ahold of, then there might be a legitimate problem.

, Every state's bar association investigates potential attorney misconduct. For example, a lawyer might divulge a client’s confidences or steal money from clients. The state bar will investigate and then punish the lawyer if the allegation is true.You should check whether a lawyer has been punished by the state bar in their state. To do so, visit your state bar's website and type in the attorney's name and/or bar number. Within their profile will be their history of discipline.
Do not hire a lawyer with a history of discipline if you can help it. If it is your only option, make sure you do your research and feel comfortable hiring the lawyer to help you with your case.

, You probably won’t have time to meet with every attorney for a consultation. Instead, you should try to narrow your list down to three or four. You can schedule consultations with your finalists.

, Once you have narrowed your list of lawyers down to three or four, you should call each lawyer and ask for a consultation. Most lawyers offer consultations for free or for a reduced fee. These may last only 15 minutes or so, but you can get a good sense of whether you and the lawyer are compatible.


Be sure to ask about the price of the consultation.Don’t assume all consultations are free. If you have little money, then you don’t want to schedule a consultation with someone who charges too much.
Also ask the lawyer if you should bring anything to the consultation. For example, if need to hire a lawyer to review a recording contract, then you should probably bring your copy of the contract.

, Before showing up for the consultation, you should take some time to write out what you exactly want from the lawyer. Your consultation will likely be short—15 to 30 minutes.You won’t have a lot of time to search for words.


Also, a lawyer will be more impressed if you can clearly state what you are looking for. Just as you want to hire a lawyer who is clear in their thinking, lawyers want clients who are clear about their needs.

, There should be time during the consultation for you to ask questions. You should avoid asking any question that can be answered by looking at the lawyer’s website. For example, the website should state where the lawyer went to law school and when he or she graduated. Common questions include:How many years has the lawyer practiced music law?
What percentage of the lawyer’s practice is devoted solely to music issues?
How does the lawyer communicate? Email? Telephone? Will the lawyer personally return phone calls or does he or she have an assistant return calls?
How much does the lawyer charge? Also what is the fee arrangement like? If they shop your music, do they charge only a percentage or also upfront costs?
Is there any music law issue the lawyer doesn’t handle?
If you are meeting to hire a lawyer to shop your music around, then ask about your chances. The lawyer should be honest with you.

, Lawyers are busy people, and you should strive to arrive on time. If you find that you are running late, then call the lawyer’s secretary and say when you plan to arrive.


The lawyer might have to cancel your consultation if you are late. Ask if you can speak by phone or reschedule.

, Show up to the consultation with a pen and a notepad and write down notes about what the attorney is telling you.Don’t be embarrassed—the attorney should be impressed that you are taking the consultation seriously.


Also, shortly after the consultation, write down your impressions of the lawyer. Pay attention to how you felt during the consultation. Were you comfortable? Did you get answers to your questions or did the lawyer hesitate?

, You will be working closely with whatever attorney you hire, so comfort is important. Think about whether the lawyer’s personality was compatible with yours. Did you hit it off? Did you think the chemistry was good?It can take quite a while to find a lawyer you are comfortable with, so be honest in your assessment. It’s okay not to feel chemistry with any particular lawyer, even if other musicians rave about him or her.
Also think about how comfortable you were asking questions. In order to participate meaningfully in any legal decision-making, you need to understand the issues. This means you will need to ask your lawyer questions. If you felt too intimidated to ask questions, then the lawyer might not be a good fit for you.

, A good lawyer should be a good communicator. He or she will represent you in contract negotiations or in court, so you want a lawyer who speaks well and can build relationships with other people.Think about how confident you would feel having the lawyer speak on your behalf.

, There are some attorneys you should flat-out avoid. If the lawyer did any of the following in your consultation, then you should probably cross the person off your list:


Avoid lawyers who guarantee that you will be famous. Actually, the lawyer has no idea if you’ll be financially successful and, in any event, the lawyer has no power to guarantee success. It is unethical for lawyers to guarantee certain results, so you should avoid a lawyer who makes these kinds of promises.
Avoid lawyers who are too aggressive. Some lawyers want to come across as more powerful than they are. They might tell you not to sign a recording contract with a record label but not have any good reason why other than vague promises that they can “get you a better deal.”
Avoid attorneys who hesitate to discuss legal costs. An attorney should be up-front about how much you need to pay for their services., Once you have reviewed the notes you took during and after your consultations, you should make a decision about which attorney to hire. If you didn’t like any of them, then you should start over and get more referrals.

, Once you have made a decision, you should call the lawyer and tell them that you want to hire them. The lawyer should tell you what next steps to take.


You can also send an email to any other lawyer that you met with for a consultation. Keep the email short. Thank the lawyer for meeting with you but say that you have decided to hire someone else. You do not need to give a reason why.

, The lawyer should send you a fee agreement which spells out what you will pay. This agreement may be part of an “engagement letter” or it may be separate. The engagement letter usually explains the scope of the lawyer’s duties and your responsibilities as the client.These agreements are contracts between you and the lawyer, so you should read them closely before signing.
Be sure to tell the lawyer if you disagree with anything in the fee agreement or the engagement letter. Call up the lawyer and see if you can come to a compromise.

, Be sure to sign only after you agree with everything in the fee agreement (and the engagement letter). Send the signed original back to the lawyer and keep a copy for your records.


You may also have to pay a “retainer,” which is a sum of money you deposit with the lawyer to make the relationship official. As the lawyer performs work for you, they should first deduct from the retainer before billing you., Your attorney-client relationship can only be successful if you work closely. Always try to stay in touch with your attorney, and update him or her on new developments.


If you ever have a problem with your lawyer, speak up. The lawyer might be unaware of any issue and will appreciate you bringing it to their attention.If you don’t think the relationship is going well, then see Know when to Fire Your Lawyer for tips on deciding when it is time to end the relationship.

Prepare your music for distribution.,

Determine your radio options.,
Research your local stations.,
Consider alternative radio.,

Read guidelines carefully.,

Send in your music.,
Wait.,
Prepare for rejection.",How to Get Your Song on the Radio," Depending on where you're submitting, you will need to be able to send in your music on a physical CD or electronically through a digital format such as MP3.


For CD distribution, you usually don't need fancy packaging or elaborate press kits. In fact, many radio stations will request that you not send in materials like this. Some musicians insist that a plain silver CD-R with your name and the song title, accompanied by a track listing in a clear plastic case, is all you need.
Whatever packaging you choose, make sure all your information is clear, complete, concise, and correct. You don't want a music director to fall in love with your song only to be unable to figure out who it belongs to!;
, Some radio stations may accept email attachments, but more often if they accept electronic submissions they will want a link to an online source for your music. You have many options for digital distribution.


If you want your music more publicly available, you can use services such as iTunes, Amazon Music, or Bandcamp. iTunes allows you to sign up to sell your music for free;Amazon Music requires you to use a distributor to sell your music through their Digital Music store.Bandcamp is also free to sign up and is becoming increasingly popular with artists.Examine several options and choose the best for your situation.
You can also get your music online by using websites such as YouTube or Vimeo. Read the Terms and Conditions for any website carefully; you want to make sure you keep your copyright and permission to sell your music!
Sites such as Soundcloud, Mediafire, and Sendspace operate legal file sharing services that allow music directors to download your music without having to worry about viruses and other safety issues., You may or may not be requested to submit a press kit with your music. However, it doesn't hurt to have one ready to go. Most press kits include several basic elements that will help people get to know you quickly.


Write a cover letter. This should be addressed to the person to whom you're submitting your music. Include your contact information, any webpages (YouTube, Facebook, website, etc.) that you have, and basic information about your music (genre, themes, etc.).
Write a short biography. This should be a short description of you (or your band, if you have one) and your accomplishments so far. You can talk about your influences and interests here, but keep this part story-oriented. Consider it like your introduction to a new friend.Create a ""fact sheet."" This should include the essential information about you: name, style of music, other artists/bands you are similar to, instrumentation, etc.

, The genre of music you play will help to determine the radio stations that are likely to play your song. For example, public radio stations (such as local National Public Radio affiliates) tend to focus on indie, jazz, and singer-songwriter types.Your local college radio station may be a good choice for music that draws a younger audience, such as rap, hip-hop, and rock.Make sure you send your song to a station that's shown they play that type of music.

, You're probably going to need to start small, especially if you haven't signed with a record label yet. College radio stations are excellent places to get your start, because they tend to be open to playing new and less mainstream music. They also tend to be less driven by advertising and business concerns than commercial radio, so they might be more willing to take a chance on your song.However, commercial radio stations may also be interested in your music, especially if you're a local act, so check out the websites for the stations in your area.


You can find radio station locators on the internet. These will allow you to search by state, city, or country.Look for titles like ""music director,"" ""station manager,"" ""production manager,"" or ""DJ."" These are usually the people in charge of receiving, selecting, and playing new music.
If you're not sure whom to contact, try calling the station's general information line and asking to be connected to the person in charge of music programming.
You can also call in to the station during a specific program: often, DJs answer the phone during their programs and you can ask them about getting your song on air. This works particularly well if you call a show focusing on the genre of music you make., Internet radio is still broadcast radio's younger cousin, but it's another venue for emerging artists. Many internet radio stations allow -- even welcome! -- submissions from musicians who are new on the scene.


Pandora allows direct submissions.AmazingRadio.com is another online station that accepts independent and emerging artists.Live365.com will host your music in their Music Library, which will allow their online stations access to it.

, Many DJs and radio stations have social media accounts now. Follow them on Twitter and Facebook and check out their blogs and playlists. You'll have a better chance of personalizing your submission if you know who you're sending your song to.


You can also reach out to radio stations and DJs through social media. A tweet to them about your music will get your name out there without seeming overly aggressive.

, Submission guidelines vary widely, depending on where you're submitting your music. In general, though, music on CD seems to be the preferred submission method. Few places will accept a digital file sent as an email attachment.


If the radio station's website provides specific guidelines, follow them! Nothing will turn off staff faster than you not following their directions. Many stations will discard music without listening to it if it isn't submitted properly.
If you can't find information about submitting your music online, contact the station with your inquiry directly. Send a short, friendly email explaining who you are, your musical experiences, and what your song is about. If you have a YouTube, Facebook, or other media page, include a link. Don't send any attachments; many places won't open email attachments because of security and virus concerns.

, A personalized submission is far more likely to catch a music director or DJ's eye than a form email that's clearly been sent to 500 other stations.


This also goes for physical CD submissions. Whenever possible, customize your submission using people's names (if you can find them) and a brief statement of why you fit in with their station's ""feel.""

, Once you've established the guidelines for submitting your music, send it in! Give complete information -- your contact info and the CD's track listing are essential -- but don't send anything that isn't asked for.

, It can take days, weeks, or even months for your song to make it into the hands of a music director, especially if you've sent it to a larger station. Don't harass people with calls or emails. Remember, they get many submissions from hopeful artists just like you, and it takes awhile to listen to everything.


The radio station may give a time-frame for responding to you. If it's past that time-frame, a friendly email inquiry is appropriate, but try not to sound accusative or angry. A simple email asking if the music director has had time to listen to your submission yet will suffice.

, It's always awesome when an artist gets a big break, but there are many artists and bands out there and only so much radio space. You may be rejected from the first several stations you contact, and that's okay. Be persistent and patient. Being rejected doesn't mean your music is bad!

Think about their image, their music, and the way they relate to their fans.What works in your act? What could you do better?


Learning and covering their songs can be a useful exercise. Figure out how they're constructing their music. What can you learn from them?;
, To make it in this business, music has to be your life. Record labels won't throw money at you and hope for the best just because you're a ""promising talent."" They want to invest in polished, professional acts that will earn them a profit. You have to devote yourself to this path 100% and give it your all. Show the labels your professionalism through your dedication to your craft, product, and image.

, Practice until you can play each song in your sleep, until the drummer's got every lyric memorized even though he doesn't sing. Set aside time for daily rehearsals, and focus on writing new material. Make the best music you can make.


Tape your rehearsals and watch back over the tape for ways you might improve.
Polish your live show in the privacy of your practice space. Take risks when nobody will be around to notice.
With enough practice, the quality of your gigs will reflect your professionalism and dedication.

, You need to strike a balance between your artistic vision and how marketable your music is. Your experimental jazzcore opera might be an awesome artistic direction to explore, but labels won't want to sell it. You need to make music that will appeal to a broad audience. Would your grandfather like your music? Would your friends? Would someone who didn't speak English like your songs? Give your audience some thought.


Make the music you want to make, but be realistic about your goals.
If you don't want to compromise your vision, you might need to reconsider your major label aspirations. Focus instead on developing a fan base that will love your corner of the music world.

, When you have a solid set of material together, start booking local shows at coffee shops, bars, or other venues that host music. Before booking a gig, check out some shows at potential venues. Make sure the ""regular"" crowd will enjoy the style of music you play.


Play 1-2 shows a month at first, until you've built up a steady local following. Then, you can start playing weekly in local venues and branch out into more regional shows.
Don't plan a larger tour until you know you can play your set weekly without any hiccups.

, The best way to develop your following is to attach yourself to other local bands, or a ""scene"" that has already built one up. Attend the gigs of local bands you like, and ask if you can open for them at future shows. Invite them to come check out a practice, or point them toward your music online.


You can also set up your own gigs and ask other bands to play with you. They might return the favor.
Note that asking an experienced and popular band to open for your small, unknown act could come across as rude. Out of respect, offer to let them play last or choose their own slot.
When you join a ""scene"" and become part of a community, other bands will be more willing to share resources and tips with you. If you need to borrow an amp or need studio connections for recording, turn to these new relationships.

, Announce your shows and release any recordings you've made to keep in touch with new fans. When labels sign new acts, they're looking for scenes with a base that has already been built up.


The most popular social media platforms among older users (18-34) are Facebook and Twitter.However, Snapchat, Vine, and Instagram are more popular with younger audiences (14-17).
Encourage your followers to check out bands you've played with before. If you cultivate a presence in the scene, people will be more likely to check out your stuff. It's hard to get people out to your show on a Saturday night if you didn't go see them on Friday.

, T-shirts are incredibly popular merchandise, and cheap to make compared to a professional recording. People like to buy merchandise at gigs, and t-shirts are a great way to make a little cash. Not only will the profits keep your band going, but you also get free marketing every time someone wears your shirt!


Exchange t-shirts with other bands so you can wear each other's shirts on stage. Cross-marketing benefits everyone in the scene. When the scene is strong, everyone in it gets closer to landing a record contract.

, You don't want to play too often in the same scene, or you might start boring the regulars. Crack your way into other venues and scenes to build a wider fan base in your area.


Book a short tour with some other bands, visiting a few cities where someone might have friends with a big basement you can all crash in.
Call local festivals and find out who you might be able to open for.
Sign up for band contests sponsored by local radio stations or concert halls.
Have someone video your shows and ask about having them played on public access TV shows.

, The first time you book a show that gets a $100 payout is thrilling: You did it! You're making money playing music! It's tempting to blow it all on a celebratory party, but don't do it. Start a bank account specifically for the band, and save as much money as you possibly can.


Use this account for ""band expenses"" only. New guitar strings, upgraded equipment, or rent for a practice space all cost money.
To get signed to a label, you'll need a solid demo recording, and those usually require money.

, YouTube is a powerful free platform for getting your music to a wide audience. Many successful musicians found their start on YouTube, from Justin Bieber and Carly Rae Jepsen to Soulja Boy and Cody Simpson. Open yourself up to an audience far beyond your local community. You can potentially reach new fans all across the globe.


Make a video recording of yourself or your band playing your songs. You don't need fancy equipment — the built-in camera on your computer or phone, will suffice.
Open a YouTube account with your Gmail login information. Upload videos to your account. This process is so simple, you can even do it from your phone.
Share links to your music on your social media accounts. Spread the word! People who might not be willing to attend live shows might be more likely to click a link and discover they love your sound.

, Give them some of those songs they love hearing you play live, plus some new ones they haven't heard yet.


Studio costs can vary, anywhere from $15 to $200 dollars an hour for the initial recording. In general, it costs more to have the recordings mastered.
Because of the high cost, limit your demo to one or two of your best songs. Plan how you'll record them quickly and effectively ahead of time.

, Different recording engineers or producers will organize a recording session differently. Make sure you've got your end of the deal —the song— down as much as possible.If you know your material inside and out, you won't need multiple takes to get it right.


Research the process and facilities before booking time anywhere. Know whether your band members are more comfortable recording separately or together as a whole band. How much direction do you want from your engineer?
Don't record on equipment you're unfamiliar with. Twiddling about with fancy amps and guitar pedals can't afford is tempting, but it will eat up your studio time. You also don't want your demo to have sounds you can't reproduce on your own.

, Don't include any covers on a demo, or anything significantly different from the majority of your material. Think of your demo as your band's resume. Which of your songs best represents your music? What songs do your fans like best? The demo session isn't the time to indulge the brand new song you haven't worked out yet or try to start free-styling on a new beat. Record what already works.

, With a decent laptop and some cheap mics, you can make a professional sounding recording and have it up on the Internet in an afternoon. Increasingly, bands are recording themselves to avoid expensive studio costs. Save your money for other things, like touring and buying better equipment.


If you own a recent Mac, it likely came with GarageBand recording software pre-loaded on it.If not, you can purchase it in the Apple app store at low cost.Apple also offers Logic Pro X, which has more professional features but costs a lot more.Audacity is a free, open-source recording software that works on computers running Windows, Mac OS, and GNU/Linux.Explore cheap or free recording options in the scene. Let your friends open for you on your next tour if they'll record you for free on their equipment.
Ask around and see if any other bands have gotten deals. Musicians are usually willing to share information if you're willing to share back.

, Today's technology lets you bring your music to a wide audience easily and cheaply. You should take advantage of it! Share videos and recordings of your music on YouTube and Sound Cloud for free. The process of signing up for an account is simple, and you can reach a large audience.


You can apply directly to iTunes to get them to carry your music, but they review all material before making decisions.You might use a third party ""aggregator"" that will help you put your best face forward for a fee.Spotify will not work directly with artists. Have your label, distributor, or an aggregator contact them about carrying your music.Don't worry about making a profit yet — focus on increasing your popularity. The industry is moving away from the album model toward one based on Internet popularity. If you get a million views on YouTube, you'll be hearing from a label.

, It does you no good to shop your demo with labels that don't sign acts that play your style of music. Where have your favorite acts signed? Do they accept unsolicited demos?

, Once you've found a strong list of potential homes, find their addresses. Send them your demo or press pack and point them toward your music online. Call to follow up and make sure they received the package.

, If you've started to experience some success, an experienced manager will be a strong asset. Managers know the ins and outs of the industry. He or she may be able to help you book better gigs and secure an entertainment attorney when the time comes.

Choose your genre.,
Learn to play an instrument.,
Write some songs.,
Advertise.,
Keep repeating these steps.,
Teach.",How to Get Rich As a Musician," Without knowing exactly what type of music you want to make, you risk having to change it later and lose fans. To avoid that happening, choose your genre right from the start and stick with it. A few examples are Pop, Rock, Pop-Rock, Punk, Metal, Death Metal, Heavy Metal, Reggae, Experimental, Classical and Country. There are, however, many more genres of music out there. You can either pick one from this list, choose one of your own or you might have had your heart set on one right from the start. Either way, just know what genre you want to make.;
, If you can't play an instrument or sing, you won't make it very far in the music business, let alone get rich. You won't even make a very big fan base. If you can learn how to play guitar, sing, or play any other instrument, you can make whatever music that you want. You don't have to become a master - as Punk Rock showed us - but it helps to know that little bit more so your songs can be more diverse.

, Now that you know your genre and you can play an instrument, you will need to write a few songs. Without songs, how are people supposed to hear your music? If you're not great at writing songs, consider being a cover artist; somebody who just covers other people's songs. Cover artists usually get more people coming to their shows but often get less income as they have to pay lots of other people so you can play their songs. Whatever your choice is, get some songs ready for playing.

, If nobody knows that there's an awesome new musician around, how are you going to get rich? Design and put up your flyers wherever you're allowed to. This is called ""publicizing"". It's necessary so people know who you are, what you play and where you're playing next. Be sure to include:


Your name
Genre that you play
Your website
Where you're playing next
Ticket prices for your next gig.

, After a while, you will start to build a big fan base and the money will be rolling in. Playing at a bigger venue that holds more people will obviously bring in more money. However, don't discard small venues to play at too, your fans are important too! Just try to get booked at bigger and more popular venues every time until you're happy.

, Along with playing gigs, teaching private lessons is always a good way to bring in some extra money. If your students have heard you play live, they will want you to teach them so they can play as good as you do. Teach them well though, students move from teacher to teacher until they find one that's good and that suits their needs. Don't charge crazy prices or the student's parents won't be paying up for too long.

, As a music manager, you will need to be an advocate for the band, a negotiator on contracts and an authority on your band's music. Foster a social nature that helps you to network and market music.

, Music managers should also develop their business sensibilities, through classes, associate's degree programs or bachelor's degree programs with a focus on business administration. Music managers earn their money from a percentage of profits, so they must be good at business to succeed.


Consider looking for a bachelor's degree program that includes music management. Some musicians get bachelor's degrees in fine arts with an emphasis on music management. Other schools offer bachelor's of music management or bachelor's degree in music industry management. Visit The National Association of Schools of Music (NASM) website to see what programs are listed for music business management.

, Read Billboard, Rolling Stone, Variety, Pollstar and read blogs and books written by current and former managers. After a few months to a year of reading industry news, you should be fluent enough to begin making music industry contacts.

, You may need to move to New York, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Nashville, Seattle or another large city in order to increase your chances of getting a job. Some labels and talent agencies filter their employees through ""work experience"" internships.

, Alternatively, you can find a mentor manager. Spend 1 to 2 years in close contact with music managers to learn how they book venues, tours, recording contracts and endorsements.


If you want to find a mentor, you may need to volunteer your time for the mentor to agree sharing expertise. You may also be able to suggest a small stipend.

, If you believe in the artist, it will easier to help them navigate through the music business. Start by managing a local band's tour, local gigs or new album.


Part of being an artist manager is to learn how to manage the people in a band. You will need to motivate an artist to do things that will help their career, even if they are not fond of the task. Artist managers have excellent interpersonal skills, and they occasionally act as a voice of authority.

, Most musicians have a personal attachment to their art. You will find more success researching the right audience than trying to lead the music in a different direction.

, You will need to learn to juggle many different tasks, so hire employees as you are able to oversee more groups. However, you may choose to always remain a hands-on manager, instead of creating a talent agency or moving up in a music company.


Ultimately, starting a music management career may depend upon your success with the first few acts. If you are able to help them make money and rise to success, you are likely to be offered more contracts or a larger cut of the profits.

Research less common scenarios.",How to Legally Sample Music," Copyrights to a song are usually held by two separate entities. The first entity you will have to obtain clearance from is the owner of the sound recording copyright. This will usually be the record company that recorded the song for the artist.To find the owner of this copyright, start by locating the record company that is currently releasing the source music (i.e., the music you want to sample). If you have CDs, you can usually look on the back of the CD case and find the record label logo. If you have downloaded the song, you may have to look online for this answer.
This task may be complicated by the fact that record companies often close and/or sell their copyrights to other companies. In other circumstances, copyrights may revert back to the original artists after a period of years.;
, The second entity you will have to track down is the owner of the song itself. This will usually be the artist or a publishing company.If the owner is the artist, do an online search in order to find the artist's contact information. In most cases, this will be their management team or their lawyer. If you need to track down the publishing company, try the following:Locate the publisher through performing rights organizations. For example, visit the websites for Broadcast Music Incorporated (BMI) or the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP).If you are using the BMI site, you can use their searchable database to find the source song.
If you cannot find the source song online, call the organizations and ask for their ""song indexing"" department., Once you track down both parties, you will need to get their permission to use the source song. Every copyright owner will do things differently. Some copyright owners are happy to clear samples and even encourage the practice.However, some owners will not negotiate with you unless you are signed to a record deal.


In addition, every copyright owner will likely want to hear a sample of your music with the source song incorporated to get an idea of how you are going to use it., If you reach a deal with both the copyright owners, be sure you draft and execute a valid written agreement. This agreement will set out the music you are sampling, how you can sample it, and how much you are paying for the licensing rights to the source song.


This agreement will protect you in case you are ever sued for copyright infringement.

, The fee you will have to pay to the copyright owners will depend on a number of factors. The first thing you will have to think about is whose music you are sampling. The more well known artists will often demand a higher fee, if they allow you to sample their music at all. Conversely, less well known artists may not charge a fee at all. In addition, it is usually cheaper to license a small piece of a song than it is to sample an entire chorus.


For example, if you want to sample a Rolling Stones song, it will probably cost you a lot of money. On the other hand, if you want to sample a relatively unknown artist's song, it may not cost you anything.
Also, it will probably cost you a lot of money to sample an entire Madonna chorus, as opposed to sampling an obscure drum beat from one of her less known songs., The amount of the source song you use will also dictate how much you have to pay. For example, if you are only using a one-second drum loop, you may not have to pay too much money. On the other hand, if you are using the entire source song's bass line, you may be charged more for permission.It is important to have an idea of exactly what you are going to do with the source song before you ask for clearance. The downside, however, is that if you do not get permission a lot of hard work will have been wasted., The final piece of the puzzle is determining how you will use the source song in your music. The more prevalent the source song is, the more money you will have to pay to use it. For example, if you are going to use the source song as a part of a five-second introduction to your song, you may not need to pay that much to use it. However, if you plan on using the source song's drum loop as your drum loop throughout, you may have to pay a larger fee. In other words, it will usually cost more to build an entire song around the sample, as opposed to only giving it minor attention., When you are negotiating an acceptable fee with the copyright owners, they may accept a flat fee for the use of their song. When you offer a buy-out fee (i.e., flat fee), you are offering to pay them once for permission to use their song. These fees can range from $250 to $10,000 depending on the circumstances. Most fees will fall between $1,000 and $2,000.Remember that you will have to pay both copyright owners in order to secure clearance. Both parties will usually want an up-front fee for the use of their song., The mechanical royalty rate is the amount of money you have to pay the copyright owner to make a copy of the song. If you agree to a licensing agreement and have to pay a percentage of the mechanical royalty rate, you will usually pay between 1/2 ¢ and 3 ¢ for every record you put out that uses the sample., You may also be able to negotiate to pay the copyright owners a percentage of your song's income or a ""rollover."" If you agree to pay the copyright owners a percentage of your song's income, it will usually be between 5% and %50 depending on the circumstances. If you agree to a ""rollover"" payment, you are agreeing to pay the copyright owner a fee when a certain number of copies of your song are sold., Whatever payment option you agree to, it needs to be included in your written agreement. It should be laid out in specific terms so there is no confusion. In a lot of circumstances, you may have to pay multiple types of fees for the use of one source song.


For example, you might agree to pay a flat fee as well as a mechanical royalty.

, There are businesses devoted to negotiating and securing sample clearances. These firms often charge less than entertainment attorneys and have the specific expertise you are looking for.If you use a clearance expert, they will listen to your music and review your use of the source song. From there they will inform you of how much it will probably cost you to license the source song's use.


These experts will usually charge an hourly fee for their work.
These experts will know the process, the costs, and the key players in the business. You will save a lot of time and money by hiring one.Conduct an online search for sample clearance experts in your area. If you have friends in the music business, ask them for advice.

, If you think you need legal advice above and beyond that of sample clearance, you may need to hire an entertainment attorney. Entertainment attorneys can help you if you are being sued for copyright infringement, if you are trying to negotiate a settlement with a record company, or if you do not think you need to get a source song cleared. If you have friends in the music business, ask if they can recommend a good entertainment lawyer specializing in music copyrights.

, If you can not get any valuable recommendations from friends and family, contact your state bar association's lawyer referral service. Every state has a service you can use to get in contact with qualified attorneys in your area. When you call, they will ask you a series of questions about your legal issue and in turn they will provide you with a series of qualified attorney contacts.

, When you have a small list of qualified lawyers, conduct initial consultations with each of them. During your initial consultation, you should explain your legal issue and ask questions of the lawyer. In return, the lawyer will give their opinion and attempt to sell you on their services. When you speak to each lawyer, ask some of the following questions:


Whether they have ever handled similar cases to yours, and if so, what the outcome was.
Whether they have malpractice and liability insurance.
Whether they have been practicing in the area long and how many relationships they have with individuals that may become involved in your case (e.g., other lawyers, judges, record label executives).
Whether they have any history of discipline from the state bar.

, After your initial consultations, sit down and analyze your options. Weigh the pros and cons of each lawyer. At the end of the day, you want to hire a lawyer you can trust and who can effectively manage your case. When you make a decision, contact your first choice as soon as possible and let them know you would like to hire them.


Be sure you get a representation agreement in writing when you first hire your lawyer. This agreement should set out what tasks the lawyer is going to complete for you and how they are going to charge for their service.

, A copyright protects the creators of original works and incentivize the creation of these artistic pieces. When someone holds a copyright to a piece of work, they can, among other things, choose to sell, lease, or lend their rights to others.If you use a sample without clearance, you may be the subject of a copyright infringement lawsuit. If you are the subject of an infringement lawsuit and lose, you may be liable for:Statutory damages, which are damage awards set by law. For copyright infringement cases, you may be required to pay anywhere from $500 to $20,000 for a single act.
In addition, if you infringed on the copyright willfully, damages can be as much as $100,000.
Also, a court may issue an injunction forcing you to stop using the source song. This might include recalling all of your albums using the source song and destroying them.

, Sample clearance may not be required in every scenario where a source song is sampled. For example, if you are using a sample in your own home and do not reproduce or sell your music, you may be able to sample freely. In addition, if you are playing live shows, you may be able to sample music without getting clearance. This is usually the case because live venues will pay blanket license fees to performing rights agencies., If you use a sample without getting clearance and you are sued for infringement, you may be able to raise certain defenses to protect your rights to use the source song. Two common examples of defenses include ""fair use"" and ""non-infringement.""


You may be able to argue that your use of the source song is not an infringement because an average listener would not be able to hear any substantial similarities between your music and the sampled song.
You might also attempt to argue you should not be liable for infringement because your use of the source song constitutes fair use. In order to successfully argue this in court, you will need to be able to show that your use of the source song was for a limited purpose (e.g., educational use, for critical use, or for a parody). Courts will usually look to see how much of the original work you used, how you transformed the work, and whether you caused the copyright owners any financial harm., Interesting situations can come up if you have a record contract or if you are using the sample for selling or endorsing a product (i.e., in an advertisement). If you have a record contract, some provisions in it will usually require you to promise that all the music you create is yours. If you break this promise and the record company is sued for copyright infringement, you will usually be responsible for reimbursing the record company for the costs associated with that litigation.If you are using a sample in an advertisement and the sampled artist is recognizable, you will need to get the source artist's permission to use the song. This is because the advertisement might create the impression that the artist is endorsing the product. If you do not get the artist's permission, they can sue you for the violation of their ""right of publicity."""
"
Figure out what rights you need.,
Determine whether the music is in the public domain.,
Identify whose permission you need.,
Contact the owners.,
Describe your intended use.,
Negotiate the price.,
Consider royalty-free options.",How to Get Music Rights," There are two different licenses you need before you can use a piece of music: the synchronization license and the master use license.Each license confers different rights to the holder, but both are necessary to use a piece of music, for example, in a film.


The synchronization license grants the right to pair a piece of music with your visual image.
The master use license grants the right to reproduce a specific recording of the piece in your work.;
, In the United States, any song or musical work published in or before 1922 is in the public domain. In most other countries, music enters the public domain 70 years after the author's death. If a piece of music is in the public domain, no one owns the composition, so you can freely perform or record it.Remember, although a composition is may be in the public domain, no sound recordings are public domain in the United States.Thus, although the nursery rhyme ""Baa Baa Black Sheep"" dates back to 1765, you will still need permission to use an artist's recording of the song.
You can find a list of public domain music at http://www.pdinfo.com/public-domain-music-list.php.

, You need to get the synchronization license from the copyright owner. The copyright owner is typically the publisher. You must get the master use license from the person or entity that owns the specific recording you want to use. This is usually the record label.


If you have a physical copy of the album, consult the liner notes to find the names of the publisher and the record label.If the music is independently published, you may only need the artist's permission to use the song.
There are three main performing rights organizations in the U.S. that represent publishers in the collection or royalties: ASCAP, BMI, and SESAC.These organizations may be able to direct you to the publishers and labels from whom you will need to ask permission., To use a recorded piece of music, you will typically need to get permission both from the owner of the composition and the owner of the recording you want to use. You will need to request permission and possibly negotiate a price with both holders of those owners. Once you have identified the person or entity from whom you need to request permission, call or write a letter.


Writing a letter is a more personal approach, and might be more effective if you are requesting permission to use the music for free. You can find a sample letter requesting royalty-free music to accompany a yearbook slideshow at http://www.copyrightkids.org/letters.html.
A song may have more than one publisher. You need each publisher's permission., The owners of the music will want to know how you intend to present the music you are requesting. Be prepared to describe your project in detail, with special attention to how the music will be presented.


If you are making a film, describe the plot.
Give an estimate of your total budget.
Disclose where, for how long, and how many times the song will be featured in the work.
Discuss where and how many times your project will be exhibited; for example, at multiple film festivals, or merely in a classroom environment., The purchase price for the rights you want will depend upon your intended use. If your intended use is charitable, or if you want to use a song by a self-publishing artist who wants more exposure, you may be able to acquire some rights for free. Typically, the owner will set a fee based upon the song you want and your intended use, and you will have the opportunity to try to negotiate a price that fits your budget.You may be able to negotiate a reduced fee if you are a student working on a project that will only be shown in an educational environment.Independent filmmakers who intend to screen their projects at film festivals can often get a cheaper Festival Use License. These licenses include a stipulation that the fees will increase if the film is sold for theatrical release or distributed in some other way that increases viewership and revenue., There are many web-based services that offer access to large libraries of music that you can license for a one-time payment. You can select the recording you would like to use, select your intended use for the recording, pay the specified fee, and download the song..

Divide music into three piles:


Pile number one: music to be given away (library, friend, school).,
Decide where you can file your music (shelf, filing cabinet...) as it needs its own dedicated space.

,
Clean your chosen area and your music sheets!,
Divide music by instrument, ensemble (you can go really far here- duets, trios, by instrument...,
Divide each instrumental pile into scales/studies/etudes alphabetically, solo, alphabetically, and/or by composer alphabetically.

,
Now, file each category in a box file(s) and label (again with color coding if desired).

,
Put a ""junk it"" tray next to where your music is filed so that you can put music there when you don't have time to file it back in its place.

",How to File Sheet Music," Pile 1 should be delivered to where you want it to go.
Pile number two: music you need to have repaired or covered in plastic. Pile 2 should be taken to a book binder as soon as possible so that it does not enter the filing system again, and the rest covered in plastic or repaired at home.
Pile number 3: music you would like to keep. Pile 3 needs time, so make sure you have it! Perhaps make this a weekend project. Preferably, wait for Pile 2 to be finished so that you can handle everything at once.;

Know your audience.",How to Get Paid Gigs As a Young Instrumentalist," Naturally, people want to get their money's worth, and therefore practice is the key to generating revenue.;
, Get a Myspace, or even a domain name, and advertise what you do- you won't get any gigs if no-one's heard of you!

, In other words, join as many bands as possible, and push for gigs with them-the more mud you throw, the more will stick.

, Even though you're not getting any money, it's still marketing, and doing a good job that is exposed to an audience can never be a bad thing.

, You are the client, and they are the boss, and therefore don't try to demand food, drink etc; stick to whatever terms you have previously agreed upon.

, If they say, ""can you turn down a bit?"" or ""can you play for a bit longer, please"", do so.

, This is basic salesmanship, if a person likes you, they will prefer to have you than someone arrogant and unhelpful.

, Often, punters will find it hard to remember the names of bands they have seen, so give them a memory aid.

, You never know where they might lead. Always be gracious, and should a band disband, for example, keep in touch. If a previous band member goes on to do bigger and better things, you'll want to be a part of it.

, Often, you can never be overdressed, and a suit or tie will make you seem much more professional and intelligent than your peers. If it is a rock gig, however, you probably can stray from the ""smart"" look.

, Don't play overcomplicated songs that might alienate them, or songs that would not appeal to your target audience. Play whatever you want for fun, but when money is involved, what the audience wants is what the audience gets.

Clean the air passage occasionally.,
Keep it dry.,

If you're going to take your recorder apart, do it with a gentle twisting motion.

,
Keep the joints of the recorder slightly greased with cork grease.

,
If the joints are loose, the cork might need to be replaced - which will be a minor repair.

",How to Take Care of Your Recorder," If it gets clogged up, you will not be able to play it.;
, The inside of a wooden recorder should be kept as dry as possible. Dry the inside with a piece of cloth or tissue after playing.

, A new recorder should be ""broken in to"". Play a new recorder for a week or so, aiming for 10 minutes a day. Then, oil the inside with woodwind or linseed oil. Do not oil the head above the window; make sure the bock doesn't get oil in it. After the oil has dried, you can play the recorder as much as you wish! Please note, a recorder should be oiled 3 or 4 times a year.

Memorize the piano finger numbering system.",How to Place Your Fingers Properly on Piano Keys1," Fingers are numbered to make it easier to write down finger placement on sheet music. It also helps explaining proper piano finger placement. The numbering of fingers is the same for both left and right hands. The numbering system is as follows:


The thumb finger is number 1.






The index finger is number 2.






The middle finger is number 3.






The ring finger is number 4.






The pinky finger is number 5.

Your 5th finger should generally only be used for starting or ending a scale, not passing tones.,
For a C scale, right hand example, you will play C, D, and E with fingers 1, 2, and 3, then pass finger 1 under the 3rd to play F, G, A, B, and C with 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.,
If you are continuing up more than one octave, you will cross your 1st finger under the 4th, changing from B to C ready to start over with the same pattern on the next octave.

,
For the left hand going up, you want to cross your 3rd finger over your first going from G to A.,
This crossing under fingers 3 and 4 (or over with fingers 3 and 4) may not seem important on the all-white-keys C scale, but when you start working on other keys, its importance becomes clear, so starting these good habits while learning this easy scale will pay off in the long run.",How to Place Your Fingers Properly on Piano Keys4," In other words, you should cross your 1st finger under your 3rd or 4th finger, not the 5th.

, Reverse this coming back down. (Note that ending on your 5th finger here is fine.)

,, Continuing another octave, you'll cross your 4th over the 1st from C to D. It makes more sense to think of the mirrored fingerings, but playing up with your right and down with your left is not the norm. (Note that beginning on your 5th finger here is perfectly acceptable.)

, (In most keys, you will always begin with your left hand on your 5th finger and end with your right hand on your 5th finger.)

Examine the tone quality from your overhead mics.,
Adjust the equalization for each individual mic.,
Apply a high-pass filter to all channels except the bass drum.,
Consider cutting some of the middle frequencies from your drum channels.",How to Set an Equalizer for Drums," A good drum set mic setup will include 2 overhead mics for capturing the sound of the kit as a whole. Listen to the audio from these microphones and examine the tone - is it bright and punchy or dark and warm? The tone from your overhead mics is crucial to adjusting your EQ, because it establishes a kind of overall constraint.


For example, if your overhead mics produce a bright, crisp sound, then trying to make each individual drum sound dark and warm will be a losing battle. In this way, you should use the tone produced by your overhead mics as the general template for the type of tone you aim for when adjusting the EQ for each drum.
EQ adjustment for the overhead mics should be minimal, but it often helps to roll off some of the low frequencies. This will make room for the floor tom and bass drum in these frequency bands.;
, Your microphone setup will vary, but generally you want to have dedicated mics for the snare drum, bass drum, and hi-hats. A single mic can be used for toms, and cymbals can be picked up solely through the overhead mics if desired.


When adjusting the equalization for the snare drum, roll off most of the low frequencies. The depth of a snare drum's sound can be adjusted by moving the faders for mid frequencies, and the bright ""crack"" can be adjusted through the high frequencies. Adjust your hi-hat similarly, as they benefit from the same type of EQ treatment.
When adjusting the EQ for your bass drum and low toms, roll off some of the high frequencies. This will cause you to lose some of the drums' brightness, but will keep each drum out of the way of each other in the mix and improve the overall sound of your drum set.
Do not listen to each channel in solo mode while adjusting the EQ. If you adjust just the snare drum until it sounds perfect, for example, you may find that it sounds terrible when mixed back in with the rest of the drum set. Always adjust EQ with all of the channels playing.

, In addition to rolling off the low end of your snare, high toms, and cymbals, consider using a high-pass filter in your mixing software. This will completely remove much of the low frequencies, which will allow the bass drum to occupy this sonic space without being crowded by other channels. This is a better way to improve your bass drum's presence than simply cranking the channel up.

, If you are mixing music that includes guitars, pianos, or vocals, your mix will likely already be very crowded between about 250 and 500 hertz. Cutting these frequencies from your drums makes room for other instruments and cleans up the overall sound.


These middle frequencies can be more readily sacrificed on drums than on other instruments like guitars. Drums are chiefly valued in a mix for their high-frequency crack and their low-frequency ""oomph.""

Acquire some prior musical experience.,
Choose an unusual musical instrument to study.,
Purchase or rent the instrument and all accessories needed to play it.,
Begin learning to play.,
If you haven't been doing so already, join a group or start performing.,
Stick with it.",How to Study an Unusual Musical Instrument," While not always necessary, it is highly recommended. If you already know how to read music and have at least a basic understanding of a more common instrument, you'll have a lot more luck with learning the new one. A little understanding of transposition and/or composition wouldn't hurt either, especially if you pick an instrument with little or no music written for it.;
, When making your decision, keep in mind questions such as the following: How ""weird"" do you want to be? (Do you want an unusual but still recognized concert instrument, or something so weird that only one man alive knows how to put it together?) How much can you afford to spend? (As more unusual instruments tend to be more expensive and in short supply) Will you actually be able to play this in public? (Or is it found in any band or orchestra?, if you wish to play in such a group.) Then, take a look at your options:


.]] ""Scholarship instruments"" - Some instruments are called ""scholarship instruments"" by band directors as they are a part of a typical concert, jazz, and/or marching band, but they're not as common as, for instance, the trumpet or clarinet. These include the bassoon, contrabassoon, oboe, Bass Saxophone, Soprano Saxophone (though this one isn't as common or necessary as some others), Flugelhorn, Alto Clarinet, Alto Trombone, Alto Flute, Marimba. If you are already playing percussion instruments, you may wish to pick one unusual instrument to specialize in, such as the Vibraphone or Orchestral Bells. Most of these instruments have method books and a decent amount of music written for them.
.]] Family members - This is a good route to take if you already have experience on a ""basic"" instrument, such as the flute, clarinet, guitar, or alto or tenor saxophone. These families include specialized instruments that have much higher or much lower ranges. Take a look at the families of the clarinet, flute, saxophone, and guitar. You can also take the bassoon and oboe a step forward, as they have unusual family members too.
player.]] Historical/cultural instruments - Look into your family's history. You may find that there is an interesting instrument that is native to your family's home country. For instance, an Australian may wish to look into the didgeridoo. Similarly, you can look into instruments from other cultures and combine your musical experience with a learning one. You can also learn to play an older variant or ancestor of a current instrument, such as the shawm (oboe), curtal (bassoon), or rebec (violin, viola), or an instrument with a significant place in history, like maybe the musette de cour, (an indoor type of bagpipe connected with the French court used even for operas of the 18th century) that interests you. However, be warned that this can get expensive, especially if the instrument isn't mainstream or even manufactured anymore.

, Depending on the instrument, this could be as simple as a drive to the nearest music store, or you may find yourself paying thousands of dollars to ship one from the other side of the world. Be sure that you can either buy or make things such as reeds, if applicable. Keep in mind that you may be able to use reeds or mouthpieces from an existing instrument on yours, if they're similar enough. If available, a method book will be a huge help in learning to play.

, Be patient, this can be difficult and will probably take a while. If you're having trouble, ask a band director, conductor, music professor, or fellow performer to help. You may also be able to contact an expert in your instrument via the internet. In time, you will develop a skill that few other people will share.

, Look around for opportunities: Check out school or professional bands and orchestras, instrument ensembles, jazz groups, or church groups, if you think they may need your instrument. Otherwise, look into opportunities for solo performances.

, Be proud: you can play an instrument that few other people have mastered... or may not even have heard of. You may wish to branch out into other similar instruments, or get to the top with this one. It's your choice, but remember to be proud of your accomplishment.

Gather your materials.,
Inspect your strings.,
Wet the rag with the alcohol.,
Turn your violin upside down.,
Clean the strings.,
Dry the strings.,
Regularly wipe-down your strings after every time you play.,
Place a spare rag (other than the one you use with alcohol) between your violin and bow.",How to Clean Violin Strings," There are really only two things you'll need to give your strings a good clean, and chances are you've already got them in your medicine cabinet and closet.


Grab a clean cloth other than the one you use to clean your violin’s body. A soft, lint-free or micro-fiber cloth is best. Chamois or cloths for glass lenses also work great.
Get a bottle of rubbing alcohol, available from any drug store.
It is important to note the rubbing alcohol should never touch the varnished face or the back of your violin. It is okay if it touches the fingerboard and a small portion of the back of the neck, though.;
,


Give your strings a thorough going-over. Pay special attention to the parts of the string that are in contact with the bow and rosin, as well as your fingers. These are the places where potentially damaging build-up accumulates.
Be sure to check the backside of the strings, too.
This is also a good opportunity to assess the wear of your strings and plan ahead for getting replacements.

, A good way to do this is to hold the rag over the opening of the bottle and tilt the bottle upside down.


You want the rag to be slightly moistened with the alcohol but definitely not dripping wet.
Remember, you don’t want any spilling onto your violin's body and harming it’s wood finish.

, Cleaning your strings in an upside-down position (with the strings facing the floor and the back facing the ceiling) is a good way to prevent alcohol from dripping onto the wood.

, In general, small rubbing motions will get the job done, but your might have to use some extra elbow-grease in spots where there's a lot of buildup, especially of rosin.


Start from the bridge on the G string (the “fattest” string) and continue for all four strings, going the gentlest on the frailest, “skinniest” E string.
Make sure to get the underside of the strings, too.
Remember, while the alcohol can't touch the violin's body, it is fine for it to touch the fingerboard.

, This might seem like an after-thought, but it's actually quite important and helps to make sure any residual alcohol doesn't drip onto your violin.


Use a new, clean paper towel or another rag.
If your strings still seem dirty after drying them or there’s a lingering residue, feel free to give it a second pass or use an alternative to the alcohol and cloth method (see tips section below for alternatives).

, The longer you go between cleanings, the more difficult it will be to remove rosin from the strings. Regular cleaning also helps to prevent the strings from stiffen up, which can cause premature breakage.

, This helps to ensure that excess rosin from your bow won't transfer onto your violin strings while stored in the case together.

Use a ruler to make sure all of the edges are straight.For example, if your shoulder width is 18 inches, the paper should be 12 inches by 9 inches.
Tissue paper is good to use for this because it usually comes in large sheets and it is easy to fold and cut. Be gentle with it so you don’t rip it.;
, Fold it so that the 12 inch side is still 12 inches and the other side is now half as wide. Make sure the corners are lined up straight so the fold is perfectly symmetrical., Make a dot ½ inch from the uncreased edge of the short side. Make another dot 4 inches from the top the creased edge of the paper. Connect these two dots with a curved line., Using sharp scissors, carefully cut along the line you have drawn. This will create the section that will go around your neck. You can throw away the small portion that you have cut out. Unfold the paper pattern before you to trace it on the fabric., Lay the fabric flat on a table or counter and lay the pattern on top of the fabric. Make sure both are smooth. Using a pencil or pen, trace around the entire pattern.


An old cotton t-shirt that you don’t mind cutting up would be ideal for making a collar. Use a part of the shirt that has no pictures or stitching on it.

, Using sharp scissors, slowly cut out the pattern. Try to make all of the lines as straight as possible. You don’t want the collar to appear crooked or wavy. You could also lay the fabric on a large piece of cardboard and cut it out with a box cutter., Once you choose a shirt, carefully sew the collar to the shirt. Hang the flaps over the front of the shirt, with the square part of the collar hanging down the back. For a more temporary option, you can use safety pins to attach the collar. You can also sew a ribbon around the outer edge for added flare.

, You have some freedom with this, as there’s a variety of ways sailors can look. Your basic option is a long-sleeve, white v-neck shirt. You could also go with a dark blue look. A baggy white shirt that has a wide neck that ties closed is also an option. This look is a little more pirate than sailor, but there’s a close connection.


A short sleeve shirt is also an option if you want a more casual or less hot costume.
You can consider sewing two blue stripes around the cuff of the shirt.
Depending on what kind of sailor look you want, a white shirt with blue or black horizontal stripes is also a good choice. You can draw the stripes on with a marker if you don’t have a striped shirt. The stripes should be about ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) thick and 1 inch (2.54 cm) apart.

, Your sailor outfit can either be solid white, solid blue, or can be half and half. So choose your pants according to how you want the overall outfit to look. Your best bet is probably slacks. You can iron them to give them a sharp crease in the front. You could also go with looser cotton pants that don’t have a crease.

, You have some flexibility in shoes. You probably want either white or black, depending on the colors of your shirt and pants. Loafers or boat shoes are a good option, but you could also wear shiny black lace up shoes or even military style boots.If you have multiple pairs of shoes already, or you want to buy some anyway, try out different options and decide which style you like best.

, Choose a thin scarf that is approximately 2 feet long. Wrap it around the back of your neck, going under the collar, and tie it loosely in front. The knot should hang somewhere around your sternum.


A basic overhand knot like you would tie in a rope is sufficient, but you can make it look fancier if you want.
If your outfit is all white, a royal blue or navy blue scarf is a good accent. If you chose a darker outfit, consider a white scarf.

, With a flexible measuring tape, like one you would find in sewing kit, take a measurement around your head. If you don’t have this kind of measuring tape, a piece of string will work. Write down the number of inches your head measured. If you used string, make a mark on it noting the measurement.

You’ll use this measurement to create the band of the cap. If you want to make sure the cap isn’t too tight, you may want to add a little extra length.

, Cut the strip to your head measurement length and about 2 inches wide. After you cut it, circle it around your head to make sure it’s the right size. Trim it down or cut a longer strip as needed. Staple the strip into a circle.

A cereal box is a good option for this step.

, With the cardboard circle sitting on the table, or counter, place a coffee filter inside it with open end up. Place 4 to 5 staples around the edge securing the filter to the cardboard circle., This wrap should extend about ½ inch past each side of the cardboard. Fold the extra down over the rim of the cardboard on the top and bottom. Then glue it in place to make sure it stays folded.

You want the hat to appear all white, so try to make sure the cardboard is not visible. To do this, either use thick enough paper or fabric, or considering making it double thick with two layers. If you used a white shirt to cut out the collar, you could use more fabric from this same shirt.

, The portion of the coffee filter that you stapled to the cardboard will be the top of the hat so the staples don’t rest on your head. Allow all of the glue to dry before placing the hat on your head."

",How to Learn Many Chords on Piano Using Two Shapes and the Numbers 1 to 51," Yes, that is simplified...







,,


When you play chords: do not play all the notes at once ""clump,"" ""clump"" but play arpeggio (ar-pe-szhe-o; this is also called ""broken chords"" -- as you strike notes rapidly one-by-one, where each note is struck in sequence from lowest to highest (slightly rocking your hand, tilting it, left to right); so it sounds like r-r-ring -- not ""clunk"" or ""crash""...
So learning scales as arpeggio is a little like ""strumming"" a guitar, but doing it on the piano. Arpeggi means playing on a harp..

Realize that chords generally consist of at least ""three"" notes/pitches/tones (Let's call them notes.),
Compare chords: notice C chord is exactly the same shape as F and G chords in the photos using sticky notes on a keyboard below... but C shown as three notes on lines of sheet music would not show that concept.

Notice the simpler of three-note chords are the major chords ""C, F, and G"" that are made up of only white keys spaced and shaped exactly the same way ""every time."",
Visualize the shape of the left hand for ""C, F, and G"" is all the same identical tri-formation.,
Notice that ""D chord"" is exactly the same shape as ""A chord"" in the photos using sticky notes on a keyboard at the left... but D shown as three notes on lines of sheet music does not show that idea as clearly.,
Realize the situations where two ivory keys are together (adjacent, without a black one between them) -- so there the white key is the sharp -- or the flat (just 1/2 step to the ""other"" side) in some chords and scales.

,
Flat a note in a similar way compared to sharping, but flatting is moving left (down) a half step in the flow of the music.,
Understand that the combination for a chord of three (or more) notes sounded together at certain distances between the notes (""intervals"") are based on a pattern (or formula) for the chord in the ""circle of notes"" like find your ""1st, 3rd, 5th"" any or all of which may be off by half steps either way (sharped leftward or flatted rightward on the keyboard) to form various chords.

,Play the same chord on the right hand with the same kind of shape with the thumb and fingers again numbered left to right ""1, 2, 3, 4, 5"" but now starting from the thumb (1) to the right little finger (5);and though it looks opposite -- just ignore the thumb and finger switching, and so it is still the ""same"" kind of shaped tripod

If you speak of only two notes that are to be sounded then that is known as an interval (like a distance).;
,,

, That shape (like a formula) uses fingers ""5, 3, and 1"". The other 3-note major chords use the same fingering but slightly differing shapes because of sharps and/or flats:


Find the fundamental note (C or F or G), and
Go across the ivory keys to the 3rd note using the 3rd finger and
And the ivory 5th note using the 5th finger (the thumb).

So, the formula for those three chords is simply left to right on the left hand (numbered 5, 3, 1) starting at the fundamental basis note which names of each chord.



, Examine the shapes of the hand for A and D chord and you'll agrees that they are almost the same as C, F, G -- but it has the middle fingered-note ""sharped"" (""Sharping"" or ""flatting"" is really only a half step between notes.). So, these both have a black key for the middle finger -- left to right on the left hand (5, 3#, 1) where the ""#"" symbol means ""sharp"" which is most often the black key to the right...

,, The flat is merely adjacent to the left side of a note and sharp would be adjacent to the right side of the same key, but either way is a 1/2 step off.

Start numbering with the bottom, since the lowest, thinnest string is always your first string.,
Know the second string, the second from the bottom, is a B.,
Know the third string, the third from the bottom, is a G. Notice how, on many guitars, there are two “types” of strings – the thinner silver ones on the bottom, and thicker, wound strings on top.,
Know the fourth string, the third from the top, is a D. The fourth string, or the third from the top, is a D in standard tuning.,
Know that the fifth string, the second thickest, is an A.,
Know that the sixth string, the thickest string, is your E string.",How to Number Guitar Strings," The hardest thing to remember about guitar stringing is that it starts from the bottom, not the top. Your thinnest string is the first string. It is almost always silver and ""unwound,"" compared to the thick, coated strings further up the guitar.









This string is an E. It is sometimes known as the “high-E,” since the top string is a much lower sounding E note.;
, The second string is the second thinnest string, one up from the bottom. It is a B.








, The G is usually the last unwound string.








, All of the notes here are for standard tuning, which is how guitars are strung in 90% of modern music. The numbers of the strings do not change based on tuning.








, This is the second string from the top, and also the second thickest string. This is an A.








, This is often known as the “low-E” as well, or sometimes the “bass string.” No matter what, know that it is the sixth string of the guitar.

Establish the basic key of your lyre.,
Now, pick a tuning appropriate to your needs, but transposed (if necessary) to the key of your lyre.,
If you have a modern metal zither pegs, simply turn them with a peg-key to tighten.,
To hit the notes of the tuning you've selected, a beginner will probably want to use an online tuner, or a store-bought chromatic tuner or tuner app on a smartphone.,
Understand that most tuners are set up to tune by ""Equal Temperament"", the modern way of tuning where an instrument will sound good in any key, but not quite perfect in any of them.",How to Tune a Lyre," Do this by tuning your lowest string until it is tense enough to produce a clear note with little/no buzzing, but not so tight that it feels about to break.;
, That is, if your deepest string is comfortable at ""G"", the G equivalent of the CDEFGA tuning would be GABCDE.

, If you have friction pegs (traditional wooden or bone tapered pegs), push carefully but firmly towards the crosspiece while turning, otherwise the peg will slip after you let it go. If you have trouble turning the peg and getting it to stay, google up ""peg dope"" for ideas of what materials to use to change the grip of your peg.

, If you have a good ear for intervals, you may also be able to tune by ear.

, Since a lyre often plays in only one key at a time, consider tuning to ""Just Intonation"" based around the key note of your lyre. Several of the better smartphone tuners have an option to tune by JI (make sure to designate the keynote of your instrument around which all the tuning will be based).

Sit in an appropriate chair.,
Orient the guitar correctly.,
Balance the base of the guitar on your thigh.,
Angle the neck up.,
Secure the body with the elbow and forearm of your dominant hand.,
Balance the neck between your thumb and forefinger.,
Keep your back as straight as possible.",How to Hold a Guitar1," When you're first learning to play the guitar, it's important to practice in a seated position. Before you can duck walk across the stage while ripping a solo, you've got to learn to hold the guitar comfortably, without having to struggle to reach the frets and the strings. The best way to do this is to learn to hold the guitar from a seated position in an appropriate chair.









The best practice chairs are hard-backed chairs with no arm rests of any kind, or stools. Sit far forward on the chair, so your back isn't touching the back-rest, your butt right on the edge of the seat. Keep your back very straight.Guitar stools are available at most music stores, and they're perfect for practicing. They're also rather expensive. If you want one, go for it, but practicing in your own kitchen chair should be fine. Just avoid the couch, the La-Z-Boy, and other soft recliners, which will build bad posture and bad guitar habits.;
, Start holding the guitar by orienting it to your body properly. Held correctly, the biggest string on the guitar (the low E string) should be closest to the ceiling, and the skinniest toward the floor. The body of the guitar–the part with the strings and the sound-hole–should be on the side of your dominant hand, which is the hand you write with. The neck, which is the long skinny fretted part of the guitar, should be on your non-dominant side.









Your dominant hand is your “strumming hand” or your “picking hand."" This hand will be used to pluck the strings of guitar and create the sound. While it might seem more comfortable to use that hand for fretting, it's much easier in the long run to learn this way.
Your non-dominant hand is your “fretting hand,"" used to press the strings down onto the fretboard and create the individual notes.

, When you pick up the guitar in a seated position, put the leg on your dominant side forward slightly, bending your knee so it forms a right angle, your foot flat on the floor. Your other leg should be back slightly to make it comfortable. Keep your back straight. Balance the tail or base of the guitar–the end opposite the tuning pegs–on the thigh of your dominant side.









Some dreadnought-style acoustic guitars have a nice cutout that should seat nicely on your other thigh, helping to orient the guitar properly. Take some time to feel out your guitar and seat it comfortably on your lap. You shouldn't have to hold it up with your hands, when it's balanced properly.

, Properly held, the neck of the guitar should be held at a 45 degree angle, not parallel with the floor, laying flat on your lap. Though this is sometimes called “classical style,” it’s the best and most comfortable way to learn, regardless of what style you plan on developing in your playing.









Some guitar teachers won't emphasize holding the guitar in this manner. Once you get comfortable, you can hold the guitar however you like. For the beginner, though, it's much easier to access the freeboard this way. If your guitar teacher teaches you to play with the neck of the guitar parallel with the ground, try it out the other way.

, Keep the guitar in tight to your body, the back of the guitar touching your torso. The fretboard and the strings should be perfectly perpendicular with the ground, not tilted backward so you can see them better. Under the sound-hole, secure the guitar tight into your body with your strumming forearm and elbow, and keep your wrist on the bridge of the guitar.









To make sure you're not hugging too tightly, practice strumming, letting your hand fall comfortably, about an inch below the sound-hole of an acoustic guitar, or even with the pick-ups on an electric guitar.
You should think of this less as “holding” a guitar and more as letting the guitar rest comfortably on your lap while you play. The less you “hold” it, the easier it is to play.

, You shouldn’t have to use your fretting hand to support the guitar. Properly held, a guitar should remain in place by supporting it on the thigh of your dominant side, holding it in tight to your body with the elbow on that side. To keep it steady, form a ""V"" shape with the thumb and forefinger of your fretting hand, and use that hand to balance the neck of the guitar.









Some guitar teachers will put a small piece of tape just behind the third fret, on the neck of the guitar as an indication of where you should place your thumb. If you're learning properly, your fretting thumb should always remain on the back of the neck, your other fingers arched over the fretboard. Be careful not to wrap your thumb around.
Alternatively, guitar wizards from Hendrix to John Fahey have broken this rule with abandon, incorporating the wrapped-thumb to great effect. If you've got long fingers, you can get away with it. Follow your guitar teacher's instructions, if you're receiving them, or experiment to see what works best for you.

, The most important part of holding a guitar properly is maintaining a straight back and keeping the guitar perpendicular with the ground. It's easy to slide into a slouch, tilting the guitar back so you can see the fretboard, but this is a fast-train to poor technique and sloppy playing. If you want to hold it properly, keep your back straight.

Buy an adjustable strap.,
Attach the strap correctly.,
Adjust the guitar strap.,
Reinforce the guitar strap.,
Loop your guitar cable through the strap before plugging in.",How to Hold a Guitar2," If you're ready to take your guitar skills onto the stage, it's common to support the guitar using a guitar strap. Many different styles and arrangements are available, from wrap-around mariachi-style straps to tight banjo-style straps, but the most common varieties are relatively basic and easy to use. Look for a strap of good quality cloth or leather with an adjustable length to allow you the freedom to find a height that works best for you.









Make sure your guitar is outfitted with strap pegs before you buy a strap, or consider having them installed at the guitar shop. You'll need at least one strap peg at the base of most guitars to make a strap work. Most guitars will come with them pre-installed.

, Attaching the strap will vary, depending on whether or not you've got one or two strap pegs. Many acoustic guitars will only have one peg, while electric guitars commonly have two. Always start by slipping the base peg through the tab on the end of the strap, then installing the peg closer to the neck.









To strap an acoustic guitar with one peg, you'll sometimes need to insert the skinny end of the strap around the head, under the strings where they attach to the tuning pegs. Some straps won't come with this, but you can use a shoestring inserted through the peg-hole on the skinny end of the strap to make do in a pinch. If your acoustic comes with two pegs already, just attach the strap to both pegs at the top and bottom of the guitar body and you're set.To strap an electric guitar, insert the pegs through the tabs on each end of the strap and you're should be ready to rock. Some straps will come with a variety of different tabs to allow for a variety of lengths. Start tight and loosen up if necessary.

, Most straps can be adjusted by sliding the buckle up or down the length of the strap to make it longer or shorter. Sling the strap over the shoulder of your fretting hand and feel where the guitar falls. If it feels comfortable, you're all set. If not, remove the guitar and adjust the strap until it feels right. Ideally, you want the bottom of the guitar to be about even with your hip on your dominant side.









Err on the side of keeping the strap short. You don’t want to have the guitar too low or you’ll struggle to play with your strumming hand. Likewise, if the guitar is too high, it can be tiring to hold your arms up that high to play.
The length of the guitar strap will have a lot to do with your playing style. Some players want the guitar as high as possible to allow easy access to the fretboard, while rockers want the guitar as low as possible, because it looks awesome. There's no right way.

, The best guitar strap assemblies will come with a strap-enforcement peg or clip on the base of the guitar, which will help to hold the strap onto the guitar. There’s nothing worse than a guitar that slips off the strap pegs and falls to the ground in the middle of a performance. These are usually simple plastic clips that will fit over the peg and keep the end of the strap from slipping off.








, If you're plugging in, a good trick of the trade is to loop your guitar cable through the strap to keep it out of your way. Insert the cable between the base peg and the strap, from the back to the front of the guitar and plug it in.









This is especially useful if you've got an input jack on the bottom of your guitar and it gets loose over time. You can keep the cable from slipping out and falling all the way to the ground.

Take a closer look at what your guitar is capable of.,
Research the information online.,
Go to your local guitar store.,
Figure out what your favorite artists use.,
Choose a pickup with your desired tonal qualities.,
Passive vs Active pickups.,
Consider the instrument itself.",How to Choose a Guitar Pickup," It can be hard to get your head around all the possibilities with the manipulation of its sound and performance. There are a lot of things about a guitar that affect its sound. Some only have a fairly small effect, like what capacitors are used inside your guitar and some are fairly relevant, such as the wood of the body and general build of such parts. However, the most important factor influencing your guitar's sound is the pickups. These are magnetized objects that generate a small signal when there is a disruption to their magnetic field, which is usually caused by the vibrations of the strings. This signal then travels around many coils of wrapped wire inside the pickup. It will eventually reach an amplifier where the signal is increased, and then can be heard through speakers. Because the generated signal is essentially what you hear coming out of the amplifier, the build of the pickup and its unique features are important. A variety of factors influence the tonal quality of the pickup, including materials used, the type of magnet used, the material of the wires, the length of the wires, how the wires are wrapped, the overall size of the pickups, where they are positioned on the body, their age and condition and the actual structural layout of the guitar. There are many more variables of the pickup's design that will influence the signal it creates from the vibrations of the strings. That is why there are so many choices when it comes to pickups, and any of these factors can contribute to various problems.;
, Gather company based information, which often includes a description of the sound, what genres of music it was designed for (although this is obviously not restrictive) and sometimes scales on 1 to 10 or similar devices that display the pickup's frequency responses for bass, mid and treble ranges. On some occasions, you may be able to find sound clips and demos of the pickup being used. YouTube and similar sites also have other demos and audio reviews contributed by the general public. All of this information is important in the decision-making process but shouldn't be solely relied upon.

, Ask your local guitar store if they have guitars with any of the pickups you are interested in, and most guitar shops will let you audition them in the store. In most cases, this is encouraged, and they are usually willing to let you try some equipment in the shopping stages to help you out. It is courteous to buy the pickup from their store if you want to buy it and they have it in stock. Aesthetic value is something that to some, is also an important factor in choosing pickups, however many consider the sound of the pickups to be the most important quality of the devices.

, If you're not sure where to even start with considering possible pickups for purchase find a musician or a band where there is a guitar that you would like to own the sound and tonal capabilities of. Doing this will narrow things down greatly because once you have an example sound in mind, you just need to follow that example. For instance, if you had decided you would like your guitar to sound similar to Steve Vai's guitar you could do some celebrity research and find out what his pickups are used for that song. Even if you don't want those exact pickups, it will help you decide between types of pickups such as humbucker, single coil or P90 etc.

, A general rule is that for warmer, fuller, louder and fatter tones humbuckers are better suited. For brighter, thinner and with a set of 3 being used, more universal guitar sound, single coils are better suited. But within these types there are again many, many possibilities and variations. So there are some methods to helping choose pickups, and some important things to keep in mind.

, One last major factor involved is the operation means of the pickups. Pickups will either be passive or active. There are also more complicated ways of pickups operating but these are often very high tech ways that will carry very unique properties. Most pickups are passive. Passive pickups require that the guitar is plugged into an amplifier that is connected to a power supply, since the pickups themselves do not provide any means of pre-amplification to boost the signal they capture. Active pickups have a built-in power supply within the guitar, and most are powered by a 9 volt battery, or similar. This allows for more expansive control over the guitar tone when using the on-board controls (volume knob, tone controls, pickup selectors, etc.) although many say there is also a distinctive difference between the sounds of active and passive pickups which can be hard to resolve, even with other tonal controls.

, Another important point to remember when searching for the right pickup is what the instrument is or is not capable of. Certain guitars are designed for specific acoustic or tonal qualities, and this will affect the way a pickup interacts with the sound created by the guitar. Electric guitars typically have solid bodies and will produce very different vibrations than an acoustic guitar. While electric guitars function primarily through the string vibrations because they do not produce strong acoustic sound, there are also subtle effects on these vibrations created by the material of the guitar itself (the type of wood or synthetic material it is constructed with). An acoustic guitar creates audible sound through the shape of its body, and produces sound by capturing and amplifying the actual sound waves as they move the air in and around the body. As such, the same pickup would react very differently when used for an electric guitar and an acoustic guitar. The same is true for all guitars that are constructed differently.

Increase your guitar's playability.,
Get the right strings.,
Press the strings down only as much as you have to.,
Gradually build your calluses.,
Numb the pain.,
Persevere.",How to Ease Finger Soreness when Learning to Play Guitar," ""Action"" on a guitar denotes the space between the fretboard and the strings. The strings on a guitar with high action are higher off the fretboard than are the strings on a guitar with low action. You want low action because the higher the action the more force is required to press down the strings. Luckily, just about any guitar's action can be adjusted. Bring it in to your local music shop and ask them to check the action. Typically you want the action at about 1/16"" at the 1st fret and 3/16"" at the 12th fret. If your action is too high, you will be absolutely amazed at how much easier it is to play once you get it adjusted.






;
, Certain strings come in different gauges or diameters. Light gauge strings are easier to play than medium or heavy gauge strings, and they'll cause less finger soreness.








, Beginners have a tendency to press down on the strings too hard. Relax your fingers, and press down just hard enough to make sure the string firmly contacts the fret. To see if you're pressing too hard, fret a chord or string as you normally would, and then release the pressure just a little bit. If it still sounds fine (or better), try to break your habit of pressing too hard.








, After a few weeks of regular playing, you'll develop calluses on your fingertips, and that should end the soreness. In fact, as long as you continue to play regularly, you'll maintain your calluses and never have to worry about sore fingers again. The key to building calluses is to play regularly, but not to play too much. If you try to play for several hours on your first few days, you may get a blister or two instead of a callus. Tincture of benzoin (benzoin resin in alcohol) is good for preventing blisters and it also protects the skin. Blisters or cuts can make it almost impossible to play, and they're slow to heal, so don't overdo it.








, Certain products can dull the pain to help you get through it. One of the most popular is apple cider vinegar, which is also a popular home remedy for painful sunburns and sore throats. Just soak your fingertips in the vinegar for about 30 seconds before and after playing. Lightly icing your fingertips before and after playing can also help alleviate soreness. Topical anesthetic products containing benzocaine--toothache creams, for example--can also be applied before and after playing. Follow the manufacturer's directions for these products, and discontinue using them if they seem to cause an allergic reaction.








, Everyone who learns to play the guitar has to deal with sore fingers at the beginning. It's worth it. Just keep playing regularly, follow these tips, and you'll get past this stage in no time at all. Learn to love the pain and associate it with everything that you love about music and the guitar.

You’ll be able to start playing right away, without any accessories. Many instructors also feel like you will be more focused on creating good sounds.The steel strings that most acoustic guitars use can be relatively hard on your fingers, however.
Acoustic guitars are great for all kinds of music, including folk, rock, country, and virtually every other style.;
, Classical guitars have smaller bodies, making them a little easier to hold. The nylon strings they use are also easier to depress than steel-strings, making this type of guitar gentler on your fingertips.Nylon-stringed classicals don’t produce as much tone as traditional acoustic guitars. If you want to play quietly, however, this can be an advantage.
Classical guitars have wider necks than traditional ones. This can make it easier for beginners to fret notes, but if you have small hands, you may find a classical more challenging to play.
You don’t have to just play classical music to play a nylon-stringed guitar. Willie Nelson, for instance, has played country and folk on a nylon-stringed guitar for many years, and classical guitar is featured in many rock songs, like Metallica’s “Battery.”

, With an electric guitar, you can play in almost any style, from classic rock to indie and beyond. Because electric guitars have special controls (for volume, tone, etc.) and require other equipment (like a cord and amplifier), there’s a little more of a learning curve, however.Some beginners avoid buying an electric guitar because they think it will be louder than an acoustic. While it’s true that electrics can get loud, it is possible to play them quietly.
Practice amps generally play at relatively low volumes. Many have headphone jacks, allowing you to play even more quietly than you could with an acoustic.
Electric guitars are as versatile as acoustics, and can be used for may styles of music, from punk to jazz and everything in between.

, There’s nothing wrong with choosing a guitar just because an artist you love plays it. If you like the music of a certain player, then there’s a good chance you’ll want to play an instrument that will sound similar. Some well-known instruments and players include:Fender Stratocaster (Jimi Hendrix, Stevie Ray Vaughan, John Frusciante, David Gilmour, Buddy Guy)
Gibson Les Paul (Jimmy Page, Duane Allman, Joe Perry, Slash)
Gibson E-335 (B.B. King, Alex Lifeson)
Fender Jazzmaster (J. Mascis, Thurston Moore, Lee Ranaldo, Nels Cline)
Gibson SG (Tony Iommi, Jerry Garcia, Carrie Brownstein)
Danelectro Silvertone (Cat Power, Jimmy Page)
Martin D-28 (Bob Dylan, Elvis Presley, Joni Mitchell, Michael Mumford)
Gibson J-45 (John Lennon, Jeff Tweedy)

, Most major guitar companies make kits specifically marketed to beginners that contain everything you’ll need to get started. If you just want to start playing as soon as possible, these are a convenient choice.Acoustic starter kits typically include an entry-level guitar plus extra strings, a strap, picks, a tuner, and instructional materials.
Electric guitar starter kits typically include all of the above plus a practice amplifier and cord.

, Guitars have all kinds of finishes and aesthetic features. You can find ones painted solid colors, with effects like metallic finishes, painted in colorful patterns, with more natural “sunburst” finishes, and all sorts of other styles. You should try to get a guitar that looks good to you, since this can inspire you. Just keep in mind that looks matter but aren’t everything: above all, you’ll want a guitar that sounds good and is easy to play., Several manufacturers produce three-quarter and half-sized guitars. If you’re young and just starting out, these can be more comfortable for you to play. Quite a few adult players use smaller scale guitars, too, either for the slightly different sound, or because they are more comfortable to play., Until you play several guitars, you won’t know for sure which one is just right for you. If you have the chance to visit a guitar store, go there and play a few. Don’t be intimidated -- the salespeople will be happy to help out a beginner. Hold the guitars and play them a bit (or ask a salesperson to play something for you) so you can hear what the guitar sounds like. Think about things like:How heavy is the guitar?
Does the neck feel comfortable in your hand?
How wide is the guitar? Does your playing arm fit comfortably over the top of it?
How complicated are the controls (for electric guitars)?

, You might be worried about spending too much money on guitar before fully committing to learning out to play. At the same time, the cheapest guitars can often be difficult to play or keep in tune. This can be really frustrating, and actually discourage you from practicing. There’s no need to break the bank, but if you really want to play guitar, try to buy the best one you can reasonably afford.Decent acoustic and electric guitars can be purchased new for a few hundred dollars.
There are solid budget options (under two hundred dollars) in both categories.
The brand is not as important as the quality of the material--if the guitar stays in tune, produces decent tone, and feels comfortable to play, it is just fine for a beginner.
If you’re unsure which guitars will provide quality within your price range, ask sales staff for help.

, Many quality instruments are sold used at significantly reduced prices. Good guitars tend to hold up well over time, so if you see a something like a used Stratocaster or Martin D-28 for sale at a good price, snap it up.


Used acoustic and electric guitars can be found at local instrument stores, through online classifieds, and even major online music retailers.

, Once you’ve got a guitar in hand, you can start playing. However, a few extras can make the experience better, and ultimately inspire you to play more. Along with your guitar, pick up things like:A small practice amp and a guitar cord (if you buy an electric)
A guitar strap
Picks (medium gauge are best for beginners)
A case or stand to hold your instrument when you’re not playing it
Extra strings
A tuner

, If you’re just starting out on guitar, it’s very helpful to actually hold and play a few instruments before you buy. On-site sales staff can also instantly answer any questions you may have, and give you advice on choosing an instrument and learning to play.Smaller shops may have more attentive staff, while larger stores may have a larger selection to choose from.

, Online music stores will typically have a very large range of guitars to choose from. If you know you want a particular guitar, this can make the buying process easy.Many online retailers also sell used instruments. You can usually find options on online classified and auction sites as well.

, After getting your guitar, you might discover that there’s a problem with it. Or, you might decide after a few days that playing the guitar just isn’t for you. For situations like these, it’s helpful if the retailer you buy from has a reasonable policy regarding returns, exchanges, and refunds."

Sit up in a chair with your back straight so that you can breathe into the horn without obstruction.
Put your feet flat on the floor, parallel to each other.
Hold the horn at a 45-degree angle with the mouthpiece toward your face. Cup your hand and place your left thumb on the thumb key. Put your left index, middle, and ring fingers on the three keys on top. Your left pinkie should be through pinkie ring, and your right hand inside of the bell.
Now that your fingers are in place, bring the horn up so that the mouthpiece is against your lips.;
, To blow into the mouthpiece, you have to first learn how to purse your lips. This is called, “embouchure.”


Practice saying, “mmmm” with your mouth, slowly adding pressure between your lips. Your lips should form a frown.
The corners of your mouth should stay in place, almost as if you’re puckering your lips.It’s a good idea to practice in front of a mirror to make sure you’re getting your form right., Without pressing any of the valves, you can use the embouchure technique to blow into the mouthpiece of the horn.


You want to blow into the horn using fast, quick blows.Make sure you’re not pressing your mouth into the mouthpiece too hard. If your teeth hurt or a ring appears on your lips, you’re pressing too hard. You want a relaxed tension against the mouthpiece when you blow into it., It will make your life a lot easier to learn exactly where the keys are so that your fingers know where to go when you’re playing.


Through repeated playing muscle memory builds, so your fingers know where the keys are.
Practices pressing the keys, knowing which keys you’re pressing. Do this until you can pass a test of accuracy.It can help to have a fingering chart while you practice., The volume of the notes you play will depend on how much air you blow into the horn, and how fast. The more air you blow, and the faster you blow it, the louder the note will sound (and vice versa)., To be a good French horn player you’ll want to learn how to Read Music.


Sheet music is the basis of many musical performances. You can also learn by ear, but most songs are played from sheet music.
Learning sheet music gives you a deeper understanding of how your instrument works, as well as music theory., The most basic thing you’ll learn first is the order of the notes and how they’re placed on a music staff.Many parts go into the relationship between notes and the staff. That's why this piece is so fundamental.

, Once you’ve memorized the notes, the next step is to understand how the clefs work.There are two clefs that can show up on a music staff. The treble clef notates the higher pitches of music, and the bass clef notates the lower pitches.

, Sheet music notates how fast or slow a song is by the tempo. It’s usually notated at the top of the sheet using a BPM (beats per minute) measurement., Once you have a pretty good understanding of the basics of sheet music, try playing a simple melody. Pick something that only has a few notes and practice until you’ve mastered it.

, Eventually, you can practice playing more complex melodies. This will help you play your instrument better and help you become better at reading sheet music.


Pick music that has a variety of note structures, clefs, and tempos.

, Now that you can hold your instrument and play sitting down, it’s time to play standing up. A French horn weighs about 4 pounds. There won’t be many times when you’ll need to play standing up, but recitals are a common one.Since your right hand is in the bell anyway, just slide it up to the top of the bell so that it’s resting on your hand. All your other hand placements stay the same.
You can buy small modification pieces that help hold up the horn easier.

, Once you’ve mastered the basics you’re ready to learn more advanced playing techniques. It can be helpful to recruit a tutor or advanced player for these skills.


Muting (or stopping) the horn creates a high-pitched sound from the bell. You can stop the horn by moving your hand further into the bell until it’s in all the way. Twist it until little or no air can get out.Slurring notes are playing two notes without stopping or releasing between. To do this you’ll continue to change the notes on your keys but your airflow remains constant and steady.Playing glissando is starting and ending on specific notes while playing as many notes between as you can., Lessons are a great way to learn advanced skills and get feedback on your progress. You can hire private tutors or join group classes. Some classes will play at events, giving you an opportunity to show off your new chops.

, You can find a lot of useful tutorial videos online. Some of them will teach you to play using sheet music, and some will teach you to play by ear. If you search, you should find what you’re looking for.

, The most effective way to become a better horn player is to practice. Make time to play your horn on a regular basis. Create challenges for yourself by upping the ante on songs you play.


You can get books of sheet music that have a variety of songs with different levels of difficulty.
Tutor books sometimes include training schedules, often with lessons on reading sheet music., Don’t be afraid to ask questions when you get stuck or aren’t sure how to do something. There are lots of places you can go to get your questions answered.


You can consult tutors, French horn websites, video comment threads, and forums.

, When you’re not playing your horn, store it in a padded case. Most cases have a hard shell to protect it from damage.

, Each time you play your horn you should clean it. This will prolong the life of the instrument.


Polish it using a polishing cloth. If it’s dirty, you can apply polishing gauze with a cloth.Let the interior of the instrument dry. Remove the valve slides and dry those while the rest of the body is drying., Every week or two you’ll want to conduct routine maintenance on your instrument to make sure it stays in good condition for as long as possible.


Clean the mouthpiece with dish soap and water. It might also be helpful to use a mouthpiece brush, which you can find at most music stores.Oil the rotors and valves. Remove the valve caps and apply key oil to the pivot points and bearing shaft.You’ll know the valves need to be oiled if they stick.Apply slide grease to the tuning slides. Remove them, put the grease on them, and replace them., Every once in a while, you should do a full cleanse on your horn. That means flushing out the entire instrument with soap and water. Use a brush to clean the tuning slides.If you want to take special care you can use brass soap to clean the horn.Make sure you apply grease to the tuning slides before putting them back on the body of the horn., If anything on your horn breaks, take it to a shop and get it repaired. It’s a delicate piece of machinery that won’t work if some of the parts are defective.

Search online for note references to use, or you can download an app for your mobile phone.Once you have a note reference, simply detune your guitar until the sound the string makes matches the sound of the note reference.;
, If any of your strings are out of tune before you start, it can throw your detuning off and you could end up breaking a string. If you've switched to thicker strings, tune them to standard tuning first.







, If you're not using a note reference, you'll need to find a C note on your guitar that you can use to detune your sixth string. The easiest one to use is on the third fret of the A string.








You don't want to tune your sixth string to sound exactly like this note. The C you're looking for will actually be an octave lower, but you can match the tone.

, Your newly tuned low C will produce a G when you pluck it while fretting it at the seventh fret. Use this note as a reference note to tune your fifth string. This is an exact match, not an octave off like your sixth string was.







, Once you've got your A string tuned down to G, you can use it to find a reference note for your fourth string. The C note that you will use is located at the fifth fret of the fifth string.







, To tune your third string, look for the F note on the fifth fret of your fourth string, which is now newly tuned to C. Detune your third string until it matches this note.







, Once your third string is tuned down to F, you can use it to find the reference note for your second string. Fretting the third string at the fourth fret and plucking it will produce an A.








Make sure you're at the fourth fret, rather than the fifth, as you were with the other strings.

, Now that your second string is detuned to A, you can find the D at the fifth fret. Use this as your reference note to detune your first string from high E down to D.








When you're finished, pluck each string and adjust as necessary to make sure they're all in tune. At this point, you may need to set up your guitar to accommodate your new tuning.

, The third, fourth, fifth and sixth (G, D,A, Low E) are tuned an octave higher. Don't be afraid that you are tuning them too high because they are tuned a full octave higher. Your electronic tuner won't lie to you.

Detune your sixth string to a D. Assuming your guitar is in standard tuning, use your third string as a reference tone and drop your thickest string to a D. Your third string is an octave higher than the target note you're going for, but the tone is the same.,
Find the reference tones for the rest of your strings.,
Drop your sixth string to a C. Because your fourth open string is now a C, you can use it to drop your sixth string to a C and finish tuning your guitar.",How to Tune Your Guitar in Dropped C2,"








Once you're in Drop D, all you have to do is lower each string one whole tone. This is why you may find it easier to tune your guitar in Drop C from Drop D rather than from standard tuning.

, To finish tuning your guitar to Drop C, you'll start by fretting the sixth string on the fifth fret to produce the G that you need to tune your fifth string.








Continue to do this string by string, using the fifth fret of the string you've just tuned. The only exception comes when you go to tune your second string. To find the A you need for your second string, you'll need to fret your third string at the fourth fret, not the fifth.

, Keep in mind that your sixth string will be an octave lower than the tone produced by the open string.








Once your guitar is tuned to Drop C, make any adjustments to your guitar that are necessary for you to play it correctly.

Use the correct strings.,
Raise your bridge.,
Adjust your guitar's truss rod.,

Check your saddles.,
Adjust your action.,
Check your intonation.",How to Tune Your Guitar in Dropped C3," When you drop tune your guitar, your strings are going to lose tension. Lighter gauge strings lose tone and sound floppy, especially the lower notes. To preserve the tone of your guitar, get strings that range from .012 to .060.Some string brands, such as D'addario, make sets of strings specifically designed for Drop C tuning.
If you feel that .012 is too heavy for your top string, you can get a lighter string for the top string and stick with the heavier gauges for your lower strings. It's all about your personal preference. You may want to experiment a little to find the right feel and sound for you.

, When you tune your guitar to Drop C, your bridge may lose tension and tilt up or down. You also will want to raise your bridge if you're using thicker strings. This is fairly rare, but still a possibility.Most electric guitars have fixed bridges that aren't affected by detuning the strings. However, if your guitar has a Floyd Rose bridge, raise the bridge before you tune your guitar to Drop C.
You want your bridge to be parallel to the body of your guitar. If your bridge is tilted up, tighten the bridge springs until it is in the right position. If it's tilted downward, you'll need to loosen the springs some.

, Because you're using larger strings, they need more room to vibrate. Adjusting the guitar's truss rod creates more space between the strings and the fretboard so they have room to sound clearly and cleanly.Check the neck of your guitar after you've replaced the strings and detuned it to Drop C. If the neck has more (or less) curve in it than it used to, you'll want to adjust the truss rod.
All you need to adjust your truss rod is a basic allen wrench. Go slow and don't turn it too much – you don't want to damage the neck of your guitar.

, Your guitar's nut is located at the top of the fret board behind the first fret, and has slots to hold your strings. These slots are pre-cut to fit standard guitar strings. If you move to a thicker gauge of strings, you may need to make the slots a little wider so they can accommodate the strings.Go slow and file them a little bit at a time. You can use a set of files, or you can simply use sandpaper. Wrap the sandpaper under the guitar string and slide it up and down the slot until the string fits smoothly.

, Just like the nut, your bridge may have saddles to hold the strings in place at the bottom. If you filed the slots in your guitar's nut, you'll probably also need to file the saddles to accommodate the thicker strings.You can't use sandpaper to file the saddles like you did with the nut. You have to use actual files. Since saddles are made of brass, aluminum, or steel, sandpaper won't affect them.
If you don't have a set of files, you might want to take your guitar to a guitar repair shop to get this work done. You can also buy a set of files and do it yourself. You can find these at most guitar shops or online.
As with the nut, be careful and go slowly. Remember that once you've filed the saddles down, you can't put material back if you've filed too much.

, Action refers to the space between the strings and the fret board. If your strings are creating too much buzz, you may need to raise the action. Lower the action if you're having a harder time than usual pressing the strings down to play your guitar.








Typically you adjust your string action from the bridge, by raising or lowering your bridge. If you've already raised your bridge to accommodate your thicker strings, you should be good to go. Just strum a few chords and see how it sounds.

, Once you have everything else set up correctly, adjust your string length so that your strings will stay in tune all the way up and down the fret board. To check intonation, you must have your guitar tuned precisely.








Plug your guitar into an electronic tuner and fret your sixth string at the twelfth fret. If the tuner reads the tone as flat when you pluck it, you'll need to adjust the saddle closer to the neck. If it's sharp, you need to adjust it further from the neck.
Repeat the same action with each string until your guitar has perfect intonation.

Reacquaint yourself with the basic major pentatonic scale.,
Get comfortable with a second position pentatonic scale.,
Review the root notes in the scales above.,
Visualize the chords that fit over each pentatonic shape to help memorize them.,
Know that these shapes can be moved into any key.",How to Change Pentatonic Scale Shapes on Guitar1," For the remainder of the lesson, this article uses the C-major pentatonic scale. The first form of the scale, started on the 8th fret, looks like this. Pay special attention to the root notes (each one is another C), in bold.









e|---------------------8-10------------|
B|-----------------8-10----------------|
G|--------------7-9--------------------|
D|---------7-10------------------------|
A|-----7-10----------------------------|
E|-8-10--------------------------------|;
, The following scale, again in C-major, has it's root on the 4th string. The root (C note) of this scale is actually the second root of the normal C-major pentatonic shown above -- so you can already see how they would be easy to switch back and forth from. Again, other root notes are bolded.









e|---------------------10-12-----------|
B|-----------------10-13--------------|
G|--------------9-12------------------|
D|---------10-12----------------------|
A|----10-12----------------------------|
E|-10-12-------------------------------|

, Root notes are the notes that match your key and are the beginning of the scale. As such, they form great bridges between different scale shapes, and they are the ""home base"" you need to return to keep the song in key. Find as many root notes as you can -- they often lead to even more scale shapes.









Root notes always repeat every five notes in the scale. Pentatonic means ""five tones,"" so each note repeats every five steps.

, Knowing how the chords lay over your scale can help you find notes, play rhythm guitar, and remember the scale shape. The two chord shapes for these scales are:










1st position -- C-Major Barre Chord: Barre the eighth fret with your index finger. Your ring and pinkie go on the 5th and 4th strings, 2nd fret. Your middle finger is on the 3rd string, 9th fret.

2nd position -- D-Major Shape C-Major Chord: Your index finger is on the 4th string, 10th fret. Middle finger on the 3rd string, 12th fret. Pinkie on the 2nd string, 13th fret, and your ring finger is on the 1st string, 12th fret. This resembles an open D-major chord., You can start these chords and scales on any note on the 6th string to change the key. The tips above, and below, are not strictly limited to C-major. You could, for example, start on the 5th fret to put everything in A-major.








"
"
Slide from the root notes to get from one scale quickly to another.,
Use little five note ""boxes"" of notes to switch back and forth smoothly.,
Work on cleanly descending the scale to move from the second position to the first.,
Jump down from shape to shape to muscle your way through transitions.",How to Change Pentatonic Scale Shapes on Guitar2," The root notes are your best portals from one scale to the other, though of course they are not the only ones. The following lick shows the simplest, easiest way to get from one to the other -- you play the first five notes of the first shape to end up on the shared root of the 4th string. You can then slide two frets down to enter your second scale shape.









e|-----------------------10-12---------|
B|-------------------12-13-------------|
G|----------------9-12------------------|
D|---------7-10/12---------------------|
A|-----7-10----------------------------|
E|-8-10--------------------------------|
You can make the same slide off the very first string, too, sliding from 10 → 12 and then starting the second scale shape off the 12.

, This is perhaps easiest to see in an example. Here, you again use the root notes to set up a transition, but this technique quickly gets you ready to continue down the scale, moving your whole hand effectively by using a few notes, not just one, to transition. This five note box can be repeated anywhere in the scales. Start with your first finger on the 8th fret:









A|-----------10-12---------------------|
E|-8-10/12----------------------------|
You can actually continue this same exact pattern further down the guitar, all the way to the bottom strings. This will actually reveal other pentatonic scale shapes.

, The same principle -- use the root notes, get used to the 5-note shifts -- apply when going up the scale, too. You can, and should, slide back up from the 12th fret, 4th string, for example, to the 10th fret. Many guitarists neglect playing up the scale, but practicing the inverse of your transitions is essential.









Remember to try new slides as well -- practice to play the notes and sounds that you enjoy, since there are very few ""wrong"" answers in music.

, This is a great way to put some intrigue and variety in your playing. While sliding from one scale to the other is slick, sometimes simply jumping up the scale to a higher, brighter version of the scale adds contrast and texture to your playing. For example, start with the low strings of the 1st form, then jump to the extra high strings of the 2nd form for a ""twist"" that pivots your solo to a new place.









Jumping across the board without odd pauses or missed notes takes a lot of practice, so don't expect to get it right off the bat.

Start playing.",How to Tune a Guitar by Ear1," Tuning a guitar essentially means ensuring that every string makes the correct pitch when it is strummed. This is done by tightening and loosening the strings with the small knobs on the head of the guitar (called ""tuning keys""). Generally, the very first string you tune is the most important one, because if you can get just this one string perfectly in tune, it's not hard to get the rest of the strings in tune by using the first string as a reference point. To tune your low E string (the thickest string on the guitar located nearest to you in standard right-handed configurations), use the corresponding knob on the head to tighten or loosen the string until it perfectly matches the pitch of an E natural.









Specifically, the note you're looking to tune your low E string to is the second E beneath middle C. On an 88-key piano, you can find this note by counting eight black keys from the left and then pressing the white key to the right of the eighth black key.
If you don't have a piano, however, you have plenty of other options at your disposal. For instance, you may want to purchase an electronic tuner or pitch pipe from a music store or use an online guitar tuner to help you find your reference pitch. One handy tuner is available here.;
, Once you've gotten your low E string in tune, tuning the rest of the strings is fairly easy and won't necessarily require the aid of a tuner or reference pitches (though these can still be helpful if you get lost). Begin by using the index finger on your left hand to fret the low E string at its 5th fret (usually this is marked with a dot on the fretboard). Use your right hand (or a pick) to play this note by strumming the low E string. Next, play an open A string — in other words, strum the A string (the string just below the low E string) without fretting any notes. Use the corresponding tuning knob to tune the open A string until its tone matches that of the the 5th fret of the E string perfectly.









Make sure to only turn the knob that the A string is wrapped around. Don't turn the knob that you just used to tune the low E string. The low E string is already in tune, so turning this knob will bring it out of tune, which can force you to start over.

, Next, you'll want to repeat the exact process you just performed, but shifted down one set of strings. Fret the 5th note of the A string and strum the open D string. Turn the D string's tuning knob until the D string is perfectly in tune with the note produced by the 5th fret of the A string.









As above, you'll want to leave the tuning knob of the A string (as well as that of the low E string) alone at this point. Turning these knobs now can sabotage the tuning work you've already done by bringing these notes out of tune.

, For the next string, shift one string down and perform the same process you used for the A and D string once again. Fret the 5th fret of the D string and strum the open G string, then tune the G string so that its pitch perfectly matches that of the 5th fret of the D string. As before, refrain from turning the knobs for any of the other strings.








, The tuning process for the next string is slightly different than that used for the others. For the next string, you'll want to fret the 4th fret of the G string, rather than the 5th string. Strum the open B string and match its pitch to that of the 4th fret of the G string. Don't neglect this small but important difference — proceeding to tune as you have been previously will leave the highest two strings hideously out of tune.









A good way to remember that you use the 4th fret of the G string to tune rather than the 5th is to use the mnemonic ""'4th string, 4th fret"". G is the 4th string from the top of the fretboard and its 4th fret is used for tuning the B string.

, Finally, after you've tuned all of the other strings, only the bottom high E string remains. For this string, you'll want to return to using the 5th fret of the previous string for tuning. Fret the 5th fret of the B string, then strum the open high E string and attempt to match its pitch to that of the 5th fret of the B string.









Note that the high E string should be exactly two octaves above the low E string (the thick string that you tuned first). If you play the low E string and the high E string at the same time without fretting either (which can be done by using the thumb and index finger of the right hand to pluck them), they should sound in tune with each other. If they sound ""off"" or ""wobbly"", your tuning of the intermediate strings was probably not perfect and you may want to try again.

, When you've finished tuning, it's a wise idea to make sure that your guitar is perfectly in tune before you start playing in case you've made any minor mistakes. You can do this in a variety of ways. For instance, you may want to use the reference pitched on an electronic tuner, a piano, or an online tuning application to ensure that each string matches its reference pitch perfectly. You may also want to try playing a few simple chords and listening to hear whether every string rings clearly and in tune with the other strings.









From top to bottom (thickest string to thinnest), your strings should be in tune with the notes E, A, D, G, B, and E, respectively.
If you don't know any chords yet, follow these instructions to strum a simple G chord to test your tuning. Fret the third fret of the low E string with the middle finger of your left hand. Keep this finger held down and use your index finger to fret the second fret of the A string. Finally, keep these held down and fret the third fret of the high E string with your ring finger. Now, strum all six strings in one motion. The resulting chord should sound pleasing and ""happy"", with little to no dissonance.

, Congratulations! You've successfully tuned your guitar to standard EADGBE tuning. This tuning is by far the most common one used for guitar music. Many, many classical, blues, rock, and pop songs use this tuning. As an example of the wide variety of song styles for which this tuning is used, note that both ""Hey Ya!"" by Outkast and the classic ""The Times They Are a-Changin'"" by Bob Dylan use this tuning.









While standard tuning is certainly the most common guitar tuning, there are, however, countless songs that do not use it. In the next few sections, we'll learn several alternate tunings.

"
"
Tune the low E string to a D reference pitch.,
Tune the A string to the 7th fret of the low E string.,
Tune the D, G, B, and E strings as in standard tuning.,
Play a few power chords to test your work.,
To tune to drop C, B, etc., tune the low E string to the desired note.",How to Tune a Guitar by Ear2," As with standard tuning, the first note you'll want to tune for this alternate tuning is the thick string at the top of the fretboard. However, in this case, you'll want to tune it to a note other than what the string's name (E) implies. Using one of the means described in the section above (for instance, a piano, tuner, or online application), play a low D note. This note should be exactly one whole-step lower than the E you used for standard tuning above. Turn the low E string's tuning knob until the string matches the pitch of your D reference tone when strummed.









Note that, if you're using a piano, the note you want is the white key directly to the left of the E note you used for standard tuning above, or, in other words, the white key between the seventh and eight black keys from the left (assuming an 88-key piano).
The term ""whole-step"" above refers to the way in which musical scales are divided into notes. Basically, scales are divided into twelve different pitches. However, these pitches aren't evenly-spaced within the scale. Some, like E and D, are a whole tone apart, while others, like E and Eb, are half this tonal distance apart (we say they are a ""half-step"" apart).

, In drop D tuning, only one string (the low E string, which you just tuned to D) is different from its standard tuning tone. The rest of the strings are tuned to the same notes as they are in standard tuning. To tune the A string to an A, fret the 7th fret of the low E string, then strum the A string and turn its tuning knob to adjust its pitch to that of the low E string.









By doing this, you are tuning the A string to the note A, just as you did for standard tuning. You are using a different fret on the low E string to compensate for the fact that the string is now tuned to a lower note.

, Because only the low E string is tuned to a different note in drop D tuning, you can tune the final four strings exactly as you did for standard tuning. In other words, tune the strings as follows:









Tune the D string to the 5th fret of the A string.
Tune the G string to the 5th fret of the D string.
Tune the B string to the 4th fret of the G string.
Tune the high E string to the 5th fret of the B string.

, At this point, you should be finished. Congratulations! You've tuned your guitar to drop D tuning. This tuning allows you to hit the low D note on the top string and gives your chords a darker, muddier feel. Note that, in this tuning, power chords with their roots on on the thickest string become exceedingly easy to play. Simply lay your left index finger across the same fret on the top three (thickest) strings and strum these strings to play a power chord. If your guitar is in tune, your chord should sound positively nasty (in a good way).









This style of tuning is often used to achieve a sludgy sound for heavy metal music. For instance, songs like ""Moby Dick"" by Led Zeppelin and ""Everlong"" by the Foo Fighters both use drop D to great effect.

, Though drop D is probably the most common tuning after standard tuning, a variety of other alternate tunings use the same ""drop"" configuration. The difference between these tunings is based on the note that the low E string is tuned to initially. After tuning the low E string to the desired note, the rest of the strings are tuned in the same way as for drop D tuning. The lower your starting note, the darker and sludgier your guitar will sound when you play. This makes these alternate tunings especially popular with extreme metal acts. For instance, experimental metal duo Sunn O))) achieves extremely dark sounds by tuning as low as drop A.









As noted above, once you pick your starting note for the low E string, you'll tune the rest of your strings exactly as you did for drop D. This means that, for drop tunings other than drop D, the actual notes the strings are tuned to will not be the same as in standard tuning, but the tonal distances between the strings will be. As an example, if we want to tune to drop C, we'll tune the low E string to C, then tune the rest of the strings as follows:
Tune the A string to the 7th fret of the low E string (G).
Tune the D string to the 5th fret of the A string (C).
Tune the G string to the 5th fret of the D string (F).
Tune the B string to the 4th fret of the G string (A).
Tune the high E string to the 5th fret of the B string (D).

Grab a slide for playing.,
Tune the low E string to D, as for drop D. The first few steps of tuning to open D are essentially the same as those for tuning to drop D. You'll want to begin by tuning your guitar's low E string to a D reference tone.,
Tune the A and D strings as you would for drop D. Next, you'll want to tune the following two strings exactly as you did for drop D tuning.,
Tune the G string to the 4th fret of the D string.,
Tune the B string to the 3rd fret of the G string.,
Tune the high E string the 5th fret of the B string.,
Play to test out your work.",How to Tune a Guitar by Ear3," Until now, we've discussed guitar tunings that are useful for people playing guitar with a pick or their fingers. However, these aren't the only ways to play a guitar. For instance, many blues songs make use of a special tool called a slide which is essentially a short glass or metal tube that fits over the guitarist's index finger on his fretting hand. The slide allows the guitarist to glide effortlessly between notes on the fretboard for a characteristic ""fluid"" sound (a good example of this is the opening lead melody of the famous Lynyrd Skynyrd song ""Free Bird""). Though it's possible to play with a slide in any tuning, because of the slide's rigidness, tuning to a style where the strings make a chord when strummed in the open position makes it much easier to play with a slide. In this section, we'll tune our guitar to open D, one of the most common of such tunings for slide guitar.









For great examples of slide guitar playing in open tuning, check out ""Goin' Down to the River"" by Mississippi Fred McDowell or ""Catch Hell Blues"" by the White Stripes (the latter is in open A, rather than open D tuning).

, As noted above, you can use a variety of options here — pianos, tuners, pitch pipes, and online tools all work well.








, Tune the A string to the tone made by the 7th fret of the low E string and, after that, tune the D string to the that of the 5th fret of the A string. This will tune the top three strings of your guitar to D, A, and the D one octave above the first D, respectively.









You may have noticed that this tuning preserves your ability to play easy power chords on the first three strings. While this is true, power chords aren't necessarily things that are common in traditional slide guitar music.

, For the last three strings, open D tuning begins to differ from drop D tuning. Tune the G string to the 4th fret of D, rather than the 5th, as is customary. By doing this, you tune the G string to the note F#.









As a reminder, tunings for slide guitar tend to form chords when all six strings are strummed together in the open position. The notes in the D major arpeggio are D, A, and F#. By tuning the G string from a G to an F#, this ensures that all of the strings will sound a chord when strummed together.

, Next, we'll do something that we haven't had to do so far: tune a string to the third fret. As noted above, we want all of the notes in our open D tuning to belong to the D major chord, whose notes are D, A, and F#. By tuning the B string to the 3rd fret of the G string (which is now tuned to F#), we make it an A, which is a note that is in the D major chord.








, Finally, finish tuning to open D by tuning the last string as you always have so far. Strum the 5th fret of the B string, then strum the open E string and tune it so that it matches the tone perfectly. Though we're tuning it exactly the same as before, because the B string is now tuned to A, we're actually tuning the high E string to D, rather than E. This is a good thing because, as explained above, the note D is in the D major chord.








, You're all finished! All that is left is to test your handiwork by playing your guitar, preferably with a slide to take advantage of the open tuning (though this isn't absolutely necessary). Slip the slide onto the index finger of your left hand and strum all six strings in the open position with your right hand. Gently press the slide against the strings and strum again. Ideally, if your guitar is in tune, you should hear a major chord that's in tune with itself. Let the notes ring and move the slide up and down the neck. The chord should smoothly shift in pitch as you move the slide. It may take some practice, but eventually you should get the hang of playing in open tuning with a slide.









If you don't own a slide, you can usually get away with playing with any similarly smooth, round object. For instance, the neck of an empty glass bottle works well.

If your guitar is fresh out of a music store, gently remove the strings it originally came with by untying the knots.,
If your guitar didn't come with any strings, purchase a pack of six strings.,
String your guitar.,
To tie the string, slip it through the small opening in the tuning peg that the string is for, and wind it around the bar the hole is attached to.,
Do the same at the bottom of the guitar, but pull this one a little tighter.,
Repeat for all the strings, then break out the tuner to tune the new strings to the desired pitch.

",How to String for a Left Handed Guitarist," These strings are usually just arranged for display, though some strings are already adjusted for immediate use. Be sure to have some way to identify which note is which, such as note cards with each note on them. (You can save these for future use in stringing) Otherwise you'll have to undo all of your hard work to fix it!;
, There are two kinds of ""E"" strings, a lower pitched string and a higher pitched. The first string is the lower pitched of the two. ""A"", ""D"", ""G"", ""B"" and the higher ""E"" complete the strings. Make sure when you buy strings they have all of these, even if you have no use for them at the moment. You never know when they'll come in handy.

, The notes that the strings play are organized in a low to high note system. For a left-hand friendly guitar, you simply make the first note the highest, and steadily lower it to the last string in the set. Since a left-handed person requires the guitar to be positioned differently, (the left hand will strum, the right will pick out chords) the strings will play exactly as they do for standard guitarists, merely far more suited for the left-handed.

, Tuck the end under the loop and secure it with a gentle pull. Too tight and you'll damage the peg.

, It is the one most likely to come loose.

, Also known as the sixth string, this is the thickest string, located right at the top.

, Follow the low E string to its tuning key.

,



A Piano. Find the low E key on your piano. This is usually the third white key from the left. If you have an electric keyboard instead of a traditional piano, that will work just as well.

A Computer. Using your web browser, you can listen to a recording of a low E guitar string through speakers or headphones connected to your computer. For example, the Fender guitar company has an online tuner built into an image of a guitar head on its official website. Here you can play low E by clicking the tuning key furthest left, either once by selecting the ""No Loop"" option, or repeatedly by selecting the ""Loop"" option. Alternatively, you can also listen to recordings of a low E string on a number of websites, such as Soundcloud and YouTube, although these are often user uploads and therefore may not be completely reliable, plus you'd have to reload them for repeated listening.

A Smartphone or Tablet. A range of apps, such as Cleartune and Gibson Learn & Master Guitar (IOS and Android), or Guitar Toolkit and Cadenza (IOS only), offer rich tools for tuning, including the ability to get your smartphone or tablet to play and tune a low E., Sitting in front of your sound source with your guitar, use one hand to play the low E key on it and the other to strum the low E string on the guitar, so that they sound out at the same time. , Continue to play the low E on the sound source and guitar together, gently adjusting the guitar's low E tuning key so as to get the guitar to sound the same as the sound source.


Turning the tuning key clockwise lowers the pitch, while turning it counterclockwise increases it.
Aim to get rid of any ""dissonance"" while tuning. This is the wobbly out-of-tune vibration that you hear when musical notes are similar but don't quite match., Once you're satisfied that your low E string is in tune, move on to tuning the remaining five strings using the fifth-fret tuning method.

Begin stringing.,
Attach the string to the tuning peg.,
Repeat for the rest of the strings.",How to String an Acoustic Guitar1," There are a few different options for steel-bound strings. You’ll need to determine which gauge string you use and what type of finish you prefer. The standard size for strings is .11 or .12, but you could go higher for lighter strings or lowers for heavier strings. Decide what type of finish from the following types:









Bronze strings have a clear, ringing, and bright tone, but age quicker.
Phosphor bronze strings are warmer and darker than bronze strings. The sound is crisp and lasts a long time due to the phosphor finish.
Brass strings have a bright, jangly, and metallic texture.
Polymer-coated strings have less sustain and brightness, but are warm sounding and resistant to corrosion.
Silk and steel strings are popular among folk guitarist and finger picking players due to their softer touch and delicate tone.;
, Lay your guitar on a flat surface, for example on a table, and put yourself in front of your guitar. You could also lay it across your lap or even hold the neck while the body stands upright on the ground.








, Begin by removing the deep E or the 6th string which is the thickest string on the guitar. Start unwinding your string by turning the tuning peg to loosen the string. You can figure out which direction to turn the peg by plucking the string and turn it one direction. If it gives off a higher note that means you are tightening the string.









Keep turning the peg until the string falls off the guitar.
If the strings are very old then consider just cutting them off with a wire cutter.
Remove each string moving from the thickest to thinnest.

, Now the string should be hanging from the bridge of the guitar. The bridge is underneath the sound hole where the guitar strings are attached. Depending on what type of bridge your guitar has, you may need to remove the bridge pin. If your guitar doesn’t have bride pins, you should be able to wedge the strings out of their socket.









Pull the pin to remove it. If you can’t wedge it out, use pliers. Bridge pin pullers are available for about $5.00 and are a nice accessory.
Pull the string out of the hole., Open the package and uncoil the first string (the thinnest high E string). Look for the string labeled 6th string and uncoil it. Each brand of strings use different legends to help users identify which string is which.








, Isolate the lightest string from your new pack. Place it through the bridge's hole that is farthest to the right of the guitar. Begin pulling the string with slight pressure. Thread the new string until the end of the string falls into place. Now place it in the groove on the bridge of the guitar.








If your guitar has bridge pins, you'll need to remove them before inserting the new string.
The best way to remove the pins is by using a bridge pin puller. Lodge the tool into the pin and rock it from side to side until the pin becomes loose.
Wait until you've fully thread your new string into place before reinserting the pin.

, To attach it to the head, begin by lightly pulling the string up the neck. Bring the string an inch above the tuning peg. Wrap the string around the peg twice and insert the string into the hole between the two loops you created.









Begin tightening the string, but don’t tighten the string too much.
While tightening the string, use your other hand to stretch the loose string so it holds tune quicker., Take time to do this process to each thicker string. Never fully tighten a string until every string is attached to the guitar. Use a tuner once every string is attached and tune to the following tuning: EADGBE.









Wait a few days to cut the excess string.

Purchase a set of nylon strings.,
Remove any strings.,
Prepare your new strings.,
Attach the string to the bridge.,
Attach the string to the tuning peg.,
Tighten the string.,
Repeat this process.,
Tune the strings.",How to String an Acoustic Guitar2," While there are different types of materials that go into these types of strings, they are generally called nylon strings or classical guitar strings. Like steel strings, there are different options for nylon strings like the following:


Clear nylon strings are the most popular and are known for their rich and clear tones.
Rectified nylon strings have mellower and have a more rounded tone than clear nylon.
Black nylon strings produce a warm, pure sound with more treble overtones. These are popular with folk guitarist.
Titanium strings are exceptionally brighter than the other strings.
Composite strings are bright and have a strong projection., Like the steel string guitar, you must remove all the strings to restring your acoustic guitar. If you plan to change one string, don’t worry about changing all the strings. Change all the strings for consistent tone and wear. Unwind the strings until the strings get loose enough to remove from the tuning pegs.


Pluck the string and turn the peg in one direction. If the tone becomes higher, turn it the other way to loosen the string.
If the strings are old then consider just cutting them off with a wire cutter.

, Open the package and uncoil the first string (the thinnest high E string). Look for the string labeled 6th string and uncoil it. Each brand of string makers use different legends to help users.

, The proper looping of the strings is the most difficult and unique part of attaching strings to a classical guitar. Insert the string into the hole farthest to the right of the guitar, and leave about three inches of slack. Loop the free end of the string under the string just behind the saddle and pull it down towards the bottom of the bridge. Pass the free end under the loop below the back corner of the bridge creating a second loop., Loop the free string around the tuning peg twice. Separate the two loops for room to pass the string through the hole. Tighten the string to secure the hold., Tune the guitar tighter while stretching out the string with your free hand. Do not tighten the string fully until each string is attached.

, String each string in your packet using the same process. Be sure to take time to create a proper and secure loop around the bridge for each string.

, After attaching the rest of the strings, use a tuner to tune to EADGBE. Classical guitars with fresh strings will take a longer time to hold tune. You’ll need to constantly adjust the tuning with the first handful of times using the new strings.

Clean your guitar.,
Check the truss rod.,
Store your guitar.",How to String an Acoustic Guitar3," When all the strings have been removed, you should use this opportunity to wipe down your guitar of dust and grime. Use a slightly damp cloth to clean the spots that were inaccessible when the strings were attached.


Some people like to use guitar polish which can be found at many guitar and music shops. This is not a necessary technique and is even criticized for reducing the quality of the finish., You can examine the state of your truss rod, the metal rod that can be used to adjust the necks action, yourself. Position the guitar so that your eye is in level with the neck of the guitar. If the truss rod is in good condition, the neck should be straight. If there is an area that is sloping in, you either adjust it yourself using an hex key or take it into a repair shop.


Unless you’ve fixed a truss rod before, you should not try to repair this type of damage yourself., If you plan to leave your guitar unattended for a long period of time or in travel, you should loosen your strings. Do not store a guitar without strings or else your neck could become warped. Try to store your guitar in a case in the upright position if possible. Store the guitar in a comfortable environment like a closet or in an environment where you could stand to live.


Never store the guitar in a garage or basement that is not heated or controlled by a proper air unit."
"
Know the correct notes for each string.,
Identify the correct tuning pegs for each string.,
Pluck each string individually and turn the peg to match it to the correct pitch.,
Use the 5th fret of a string to match the sound of the string immediately below.,
Strum a chord or play a few notes to check the intervals.,
Play and retune your guitar for 15-20 minutes after putting on new strings.",How to Tune an Acoustic Guitar1," It'll be hard to tune the guitar without knowing the proper notes for each string. Starting with the lowest, thickest string (which should be the closest to the ceiling when you're holding the guitar properly) the standard tuning for the strings is, from low to high:


E
A
D
g
b
e (thinnest string)
;
, Follow each string up to the corresponding tuning peg to make sure you know which peg to turn to tune each string, and which direction. Before you consult a tuner, pluck the string a few times and turn the peg to make it go up (clockwise) and make it go down (counterclockwise).









Depending on the guitar and how it was strung, the direction might be different. This is why it's important to check first. However, all professional stringing will be in this direction, since it helps keep the strings in tune.

, If you're using an electric tuner, turn it on and hold it close enough to the guitar so it can pick up enough sound. Pluck the string repeatedly and turn the tuning peg until it matches the pitch as closely as possible. You can also try to match each string to a guide track, like ""standard tuning examples"" found on Google or YouTube.









If you're sharp (too high) lower the note by turning the tuning peg to loosen it, making it lower, until you get it to the proper pitch.If you're flat (too low) then you need to raise the note by turning it smoothly up, creating tension on the string and making the note higher. Keep turning it until you reach the proper pitch.
You can also match the guitar to itself, to a piano, or any other instrument to match the pitch. If you're playing with a trumpet player, for example, ask for an E and adjust the tuning of the 6th string until you've matched the pitch.

, The 6th string, 5th fret note should be identical to the 5th string played openly -- they are both As. This system insures that the intervals between notes are identical, so that even if the guitar is not perfectly tuned, it is tuned relative to itself. To tune the 5th string, for example, you would play the 6th string, 5th fret note and match the tone of the 5th string exactly to this.









The only exception is on the B string. You must hold the 4th fret of the G string (3rd string) to tune the B string.

, An acoustic guitar is made of wood, and the resonance of the strings, even when tuned properly, might not sound exactly right. Play a G chord, or another first-position chord to check to make sure the guitar sounds correct and is in tune. Make slight adjustments as necessary.









The B string, in particular, will usually need to be tuned slightly flat to create a truly perfectly-tuned guitar. Experiment some and listen closely to make sure the guitar is in tune.

, Strings need time to stretch out when first placed, meaning they fall out of tune very quickly. To help get them in shape, tune the guitar, then play for a few minutes. Retune and repeat, playing until the strings stay more or less in tune for a few minutes straight.

Usually metal pieces like the rivets on your jeans, buttons and zippers of a jacket, and belt buckles create the most noise when rubbing against your guitar. Be cognizant of how your outfit can affect your recording.;
, The sound that you are trying to achieve determines the type of strings you should use. Steel-cored wound strings come in a variety of different types and each have their own properties. You want a gauge suited for you and you want to make sure that your setup is correct so that there is no buzzing.


Lighter gauge strings like 11 - 50 set are easier to play but produce a thinner sound quality. A heavier gauge set, like one beginning with a 15 gauge top E, will produce a heavier sound that lacks in overtones. Compromise by using strings that are the heaviest you feel comfortable playing.
Use an electronic tuner between each take to ensure you have accurate tuning at all times.
For example, the most commonly used type of strings are bronze, phosphor bronze, and nickel wound for acoustic guitars.

, If you are using a pick, try picks with different thickness. Take your time choosing the right pick before you go into recording as this will make each stage of recording easier. When layering multiple tracks use thin picks.

, The environment in which you play your acoustic guitar will greatly affect how your instrument will sound as they thrive on live acoustics. Home studios may provide insufficient natural reverb. Be cautious of too long a reverb time because this will produce a muddy sound. This usually happens in smaller studios.


You may add artificial reverb after the recording to liven a dead room or to produce a more preferable sound however, live natural acoustics will always sound better.
Try to liven up the sound in your room by playing close to reflective surfaces such as doors, hard floors, and solid furniture. Place a sheet of plywood or a sheet of hard board underneath carpeting if your sound is being dampened. If the sound isn’t working in your studio, run cables so that you may play at a different location while still being able to capture your recording with the studio equipment.
If time permits, experiment with the rooms. Before you begin recording check the sound of each room. The guitar must sound its best both to the performer and the recording engineer. Select your mic only when both are satisfied.

, Create a budget as there are many varieties of microphones for every kind of recording need. Mics for acoustic guitars will often attach directly to your instrument. These microphones will attach to the body of your guitar and will be small, lightweight, and respond specifically to the frequency of your guitar. While they give the performer freedom of movement they can also be at the top of the price range.You may try a USB microphone because of their simplicity and convenience. There are a wide variety of USB microphones including dynamic and condenser mics used for both vocals and instruments. While they range in price, some work with iOS and Android apps to turn your mobile device into a portable recording studio., Commonly aim the mic at where the body of the guitar joins the neck and place it about 40cm from the guitar itself. You want a well-integrated sound where you control the sound hole’s contribution by not pointing the mic directly at it as well as control the levels of reflected and direct sound. Use enclosed headphone to tweak the mic placement as you listen to the instrument but remember to check on your monitors before finalizing mic placement.


To brighten a bassy sound move the mic towards the neck. For a fuller sound with more warmth, move the mic closer to the sound hole. Increase the amount of room ambience that is recorded by moving the mic further from the guitar; however, it will also dry the sound up.
Use headphones to place the mic at less conventional placements. For example, you may set up a mic or two over the player’s shoulder to capture the sound that she hears. You may also point the mic at a reflective surface or underneath the guitar. Try out different locations with your headphones if conventional theory isn’t giving you the sound that you want.

, Make sure you aren’t wasting your time by testing out your mic with all your recording equipment. Whether it’s feedback monitors or the recording apparatus, make sure to have several mic checks before allowing your guitar player to perform.


Allow the performer to hear what the room will sound like so she can get comfortable with the space. A mic check benefits the performer the most, the engineer the second, and the audience third. Use the mic check to get the performer comfortable with the sound coming from the monitors and to balance the sound of the room.
When conducting a mic check you should be looking for issues with feedback, a poor recording, monitor mixes that are unsatisfactory to you or the performer, and glitches or technical issues that may disrupt the performance like bad cables.

Invest in a quality chromatic guitar tuner.,
Tune up, don't tune down, whenever possible.,
Use fresh strings.,
Let the wood settle.,
Use your eyes and your ears.",How to Tune an Acoustic Guitar2," The easiest and most accurate way to tune your guitar properly is to use an electronic guitar tuner that reads your tone, usually provides a visual gauge of how on or off of pitch you are, and tells you which direction you need to tune. It does everything but turn the pegs for you.


These tuners range in price and quality from cheap to somewhat fancier acoustic tuners that can be fairly expensive. To get started, get a cheap one in your price range, or research free online options.

, It's important on all acoustic stringed instruments, especially acoustic guitars, to tune from flat to sharp, rather than tuning from sharp to flat. You're more likely to slip out of tune if the tension on the string is going down (as it will when you tune sharp-to-flat), so it's better to create the correct directional tension on the string by tuning up, instead of tuning down.









Even if the string is sharp (which it usually won't be), tune it down lower than it should be first and then tune it up to the correct pitch.

, Old worn-out strings won't stay in tune as easily. If you're having to constantly re-tune, or your strings are getting a little raggedy, consider changing the strings of your guitar to fresher strings that'll stay in tune while you play. The guitar will sound better and will be a lot more fun to practice on if you've got fresh strings on it.

, Get the strings in the neighborhood and then fine-tune more accurately, especially if you're putting on new strings. The strings put a lot of tension (hundreds of pounds of pressure) on the frame of the guitar, and acoustic guitars are very susceptible to a bit of shifting and settling, especially older bodies and different varieties of wood.


Don't get frustrated if you tune the guitar perfectly and it slips out a few minutes later. This is normal. Tug on the strings some as you tune to get the extra slack out and let it sit a few minutes, then check it again.

, While it's important to tune accurately and give the electric tuner its due credit, it's also important to learn to really hear the strings and learn to distinguish when something's a little off. Experienced guitar players don't have to have perfect pitch or consult their tuner to know when something's a little off. Listen to the notes as you tune and you'll be able to tune more accurately.

Tune the guitar to a piano.,
Look for free online tuners and apps.,
Tune the guitar to itself harmonically.,
Use alternate tunings on an acoustic guitar.",How to Tune an Acoustic Guitar3," If you've got a well-tuned and maintained piano or keyboard handy and are familiar with the notes, one easy way to quickly tune your guitar is to play each note and match the pitch of the corresponding string.








, Lots of tone-generating devices and e-tuners are available that you can use quickly and in a pinch to get your guitar in tune. One of the most effective tuners available is the basic tuner available in the Apple app store. It's super cheap and super accurate. As long as your phone has juice in it, you can tune your guitar.

, You might not be able to get a guitar in perfect pitch, but you can at least make sure the guitar is tuned to itself appropriately by matching the intervals of all the strings. When you fret the low E string at the fifth fret, that's an A. So, to tune the guitar, you can play an A on the E string and tune your A string. This is a good way of checking the relationships between all the strings after you've consulted an electronic tuner, or just getting the guitar in tune with itself so you can play alone or practice.









This is true of the relationships between all the strings but G and B. For that interval, fret the G string at the fourth fret, which should be a B.

, You don't always have to tune your strings the same old way. Famous guitar players like Jimmy Page, Keith Richards, and John Fahey frequently used alternate tunings to play their best-known songs, and alternate tunings are great for playing Delta blues or slide guitar styles. Some guitar players like to tune the bottom string to D, rather than E, making it easier to play certain chords and some styles of music.This is called Drop-D tuning. Other common alternate tunings include:









Irish tuning (DADGAD)
Open C tuning (CGCGCE)
Open D tuning (DADF#AD
Open G tuning (DGDGBD)

Trim your fingernail length according to your hand use.",How to Play Classical Guitar," Classical guitars use soft steel strings for E, A, and D as well as nylon strings for G, B, and E. This produces a warmer sound relative to other guitars. The principles for learning chords and scales are the exact same for any guitar except that the sound that is produced will be much different. , Your thumb will always play the E, A, and D string which are the thicker strings closest to the top of the guitar with E being the thickest and closest to the top. Index finger plays G, middle finger plays B, ring finger plays the final string closest to the ground.Pinch the strings by using both your thumb and other fingers simultaneously. Pull multiple strings at the same time or just two depending on what’s called for.
Strumming open chords means that your other hand will not be pressing down on any strings.

, Begin with the G major scale where your index finger is your first finger. The key of G starts on the third fret. The first finger uses all the strings within the second fret, the second finger uses all the strings within the third fret, third finger uses all the chords in the fourth fret, and your pinky will use all the chords in the fifth fret. Pluck each individual string with your opposite hand in the following sequence: 2, 4, 1, 2, 4, 1, 3, 4, and 1. , Assign each string a number starting at the smallest string, closest to your feet, as one, and count each successive string upward until you get to six, the largest string.This will help you follow along as you watch others play without learning how to read music.


Each finger will be assigned a string depending on the chord or scale that you’re trying to play. For example, to play the g chord have your middle finger on the third fret of the 6th string, you index finger on the second fret of the fifth string, place your ring finger on the third fret of the second string, and place your pinky on the third fret of the first string. Strum all strings with your other hand to produce the g chord., Use your first three fingers of your left hand. Place your third finger on the second string, second fret. Place your second finger on the third string, second fret. Place your first finger on the fourth string, second fret. Use your thumb on the other hand to play the fifth string to create the A chord., Use your first three fingers of your left hand. Place the first finger on the third string, first fret. Place your third finger on the fourth string, second fret. Place your second finger on the fifth string, second fret. Use your thumb on the other hand to strum all the strings to create an E chord.You may also strum only the strings being held down.

, The top part, or the head, of the guitar should guide you. The head is composed of the top of the strings and tuning keys. You will need to make sure your guitar is in tune before anything else by adjusting the tuning keys., Frets line the neck and fingerboards are in between each fret. A fret is a small metal line while the circular metal notches on the neck are your position markers. Position markers let you know where you are in relation to the length of the scale.The fretboard is also known as the fingerboard and is either a flat or slightly curved piece of wood that has metal fretwires embedded onto it. When you pinch a guitar string against the fretboard you produce a higher tone because you shorten the vibrating length of the string.Frets divide the length of string mathematically. A different pitch is produced with each fret. An octave is produced at every 12 frets. Frets often are the first to wear out if you play your guitar often but they can be replaced or re-shaped as needed., The end of the strings are held up by the saddle and bridge. These two components also keep your strings taut with your tuning keys. The opening at the center of your guitar aids in projecting the sound of your guitar. It is known as the soundhole. In order to protect the body of your guitar from scratching, there is a piece of protective material above the sound hole known as a pick guard.The body is an essential element in shaping the overall sound of your guitar. The soundboard is the top of the guitar body and is well crafted and engineered. Internal bracing greatly affects the sound quality of your guitar. The sound of your guitar is produced when the vibration energy of your strings is transferred to your guitar top.The body acts as a resonating chamber and projects the vibrations of the strings using the sound hole, which amplifies the sound. Your guitar’s maximum volume is determined by by the amount of air it moves through the sound hole., Classic guitar is played on a chair. Choose a chair that is without elbow rests and has a firm base. Elbow rests will get in the way when you play and you will need a firm base to give you support and keep you comfortable. Do not slouch as this will hurt your back.


Your lower legs and thigh should create a 90 degree angle or as close to a 90 degree angle as you can manage. The chair height will determine your leg positioning., Your leg positioning should alleviate any stress on your lower back. Legs are commonly shoulder width apart but some guitarists may also prefer a wider stance. Comfort is your number one priority.


Some traditions state a different leg position. For example, Spanish guitarists play with their legs together.Position yourself so that your back is comfortable. The more curved your legs make your back, the more stress you put on your back., This assumes that you will be playing right handed, otherwise simply flip the instructions. Your left hand should reach the fretboard with ease. You shouldn’t have to drop your left shoulder as you try to reach the fretboard. Correct playing position should be comfortable and without strain.Use a footstool to raise the left leg and, therefore, raise the guitar resting on it closer to your left hand. The footstool must be at a position that is comfortable depending on your height and the height of your chair.Use a guitar support to raise your guitar. A guitar support is exactly as it sounds. Simply rest it on your left leg to raise your guitar.Be aware that some argue that raising your left leg causes your lower spine to twist. Fatigue and stress may result in such a movement., It’s imperative that you feel comfortable when playing classical guitar. While comfort is different for each person, be sure to develop good habits to make sure you don’t sacrifice long term health for short term comfort. Most important is having a relaxed and straight back along with an open chest. This posture allows you to breathe freely while seated in a comfortable position.You will also need to be in a position that allows your arms to move freely and easily. Any position that puts a strain on any part of your body needs to be adjusted., Trim the fingernails of your fretting hand so that you have maximum control when holding the strings. Keep your fingernails longer for your picking hand as this will help you play. While some players use fingertips, longer fingernails may help to produce a higher volume.A combination of fingernail length works best especially with long nails and guitar rhythm through taps and strumming. However, fingernail length should be kept at what is comfortable for you. being used for strumming and taps."

Choose your guitar.,
Learn the anatomy of your guitar.,
Know the strings.,
Tune your guitar.,
Set the guitar up so you can play comfortably, with relaxed shoulder, elbow, and wrist.",How to Play the Acoustic Guitar1," Although you already know that you want to learn on an acoustic guitar, there are still other things to take into consideration. Look for the best size and price for your lifestyle. Avoid buying budget acoustic guitars, as they are typically made poorly and are very difficult to play. Typically, look for guitars that cost, at least, $300. These are better quality and have a better sound than cheap guitars.









Find a guitar with a low action. The action is the distance from the strings to the neck of the guitar. A high action means you have to press down harder on the strings which can be painful and difficult for beginners. Finding a guitar with a low action will make it easier and more comfortable to play.
Always buy wooden acoustic guitars. Although you can sometimes find acoustic guitars that are made of a composite material, their sound isn’t as good as classic wood acoustics.
Avoid a ¾ size guitar, even if you or your hands seem very small. The sound this size of guitar creates is not as good as a full size, and with practice even a very small person or child can play a full sized guitar.
If you are left-handed, be sure to purchase a special left-handed guitar. Otherwise, the strings will all be in reverse order for you.
Don’t be afraid to use an old or used guitar instead of buying new. As long as the guitar is in good condition and makes a good sound, there is no problem playing a used instrument. Many people think they sound better, even.;
, Before you start playing, it is important that you understand all the basic parts of a guitar. While the ""body,"" the big rounded base of the guitar, is obvious, knowing the other parts makes playing much easier.









The neck of the guitar is the long narrow part of the guitar where you can find the strings. It is on the bottom, with the fingerboard (or sometimes called the fretboard) on top. The flat place you hold the strings to is the fingerboard.
The headstock is the wooden piece at the end of the neck where the tuners are located. This is where the strings end.
The fret wires are thin metal strips that go across the fingerboard. A fret is the space between two fret-wires. The first fret is the one closest to the headstock, and they count up as you move towards the body of the guitar.
The bridge is the small metal or plastic bit on the body of the guitar that the strings attach to. Right next to the sound hole. This is where you begin if you need to put new strings on your guitar.

, The thickest, lowest-sounding string is low-E. This is the 6th string. Then, moving away from low-E, the strings go A, D, G, B, and high-E. You can remember these strings with the mnemonic, ""Eddie Ate Dynamite, Good Bye Eddie.""









Note how the highest string, the thick E, is the 6th string. The strings on the guitar count upwards, meaning the bottom string (the thinnest one) is the 1st string.

, Before you start to play, you need to make sure your guitar is in tune. If it is not, then your music won’t sound good. Even if you buy a brand new guitar, you should always make sure it is in tune.









To tune the guitar, twist the tuner knobs on the headboard of the guitar. These work to make a string tighter or looser which changes the sound.
Always start tuning your guitar from the lowest note and work your way to the highest. Because the thicker a string is, the less likely it will go out of tune, you should always start with low-E. Buy an electric tuner to help you find the right notes. These work by listening to the sound a string makes and telling you if the note is flat or sharp.
Without a tuner, you can tune your guitar using a piano or keyboard. These instruments stay in tune for many years and are a reliable way to match tone. Play the same key on the piano as the string you are trying to tune, and twist the tuner until the plucked string makes the same sound as the piano key. Humming along may help. , Once you’ve gotten your guitar all settled, put your body in the right position for playing. If you are just beginning, you will probably find it easier to sit rather than stand and play.









Rest the guitar on your strumming knee. If you are right-handed, this will be your right knee. You may find it helpful to raise your toes off the ground a bit to get the guitar at the right height.
Hold the neck of the guitar so that it rests on your thumb and your fingers wrap around to the top of the fingerboard.
Keep your shoulders, elbows, and wrists relaxed. Your elbow should be in towards your body.

Learn how to strum.,
Use a metronome to help you get perfect rhythm.,
Play along to recorded songs to learn from the best.,
Practice daily to grow skills the fastest.",How to Play the Acoustic Guitar3," When you know how to hold the strings to make notes and chords, the next step is to get your strumming down. Strumming is basic, and can be done a multitude of ways. Essentially, run your strumming hand quickly over the strings and over the hollow space to create sound. You can use your fingertips, fingernails, or a guitar pick to strum, but most people find it easiest to start with a pick..









There are many different strumming patterns, but two of the most basic are running your hand back and forth over the strings in a fast-pace, or running them in one direction only.
If you are playing a chord, don’t feel obligated to strum all of the strings. Instead, you can choose to strum only the strings which you need to play the chord.
Don’t worry about getting your strumming pattern fixated until you can play chords accurately. It is better to be slow and strumming to start and play accurate chords, than to strum quickly but have your fingers in the wrong place or playing notes poorly.
Plucking strings is when you pick at individual strings, and is generally a little more difficult for beginners. Reserve plucking for a time after you’ve already developed basic strumming skills.

, Rhythm comes with practice, and is very difficult to get at first. When you are first learning chords, you will likely have to pause multiple times to put your fingers in the right position, which is fine. Over time though, develop rhythm with your strumming to give your music a better sound. Using a metronome ensures you're always practice perfectly on time.








, Although putting together chords and strumming in a timely manner can take some time to master, the best way to practice both is to play songs that you know. Many beginning guitar books offer children's songs to start, but you can learn popular songs as well.









Check out this collection of 10 beginner songs on Wikihow.

Search online for “guitar tabs” to get the music to play your favorite guitar songs. These will tell you the chord that needs to be played, and on some sites you will be shown how to play that specific chord as well.

, By far the most important thing you can do when learning how to play the guitar, is to practice on a regular basis. This will help you to become accustomed to the shape your hands must take, strumming and rhythm, and learning new songs. Remember that 20-30 minutes every day is a much better way to learn than playing three hours, but only on Saturdays. Try out some more lessons as you learn:

Enjoy.",How to Set Your Guitar's Intonation," There are several facts that you need to know before you perform this process.
, Tune all of the strings directly to the tuner. No 5th fret or harmonic tuning here.


For electric or acoustic-electric instruments: Use a programmable electric tuner with stroboscope display that you can plug directly into. A mechanical stroboscope can be the most accurate display in 2010. Use the chromatic equation below to get the pitch frequencies fn for this programmable tuner.

For acoustic instruments: Use an extremely quiet (and dead) room with a mic tuner. Remember, set up your instrument for the tuning you're going to use. If your band plays in drop D, Ab standard, G modal, or any other tuning you should tune your instrument to the tuning you are going to use. Standard E drop to D is better than standard tuning because of lower string tensions.

Bassists: Throughout this process you should be using a pick, even if you do not normally play with one. The way we pluck the string with our fingers works very well when we're playing, but it just is not accurate (or consistent) enough for this process.

For all instruments: Tune the entire instrument several times. As the tension on each string changes it may alter the way your neck is sitting and may detune your other strings. Stick with this step until every string is open tuned as close as possible to perfect. When you're tuned, move on to the next step.

, If you have any desire to raise or lower your string action (the distance between your strings and the fretboard) you should do it now. This means if the string is buzzing raise it so that it does not! When the string is vibrating or buzzing on the next higher pitch fret, the note pitch can quickly and temporarily switch making intonation tuning very difficult. The two pitches may briefly and temporarily blend making sometimes the note pitch a little sharp. The buzzing sometimes produce some harmonic pitches that can reduce the purity of the pitches of the higher pitch frets; the tenth fret note pitches can sound a little higher. The smaller the magnitude and duration of the buzzing on adjacent frets the smaller the offsets d has to be. If you alter your action after you complete the intonation setting process, you may undo all of the work you are about to do. If you do alter your action on any string, repeat step 2.

The better quality guitars can have their strings closer to the frets with less buzzing. The closer the string(s) to the frets, the less the string stretching and tension increase when pressed, the smaller the offsets d have to be, the significantly (exponentially) better the intonation tuning due to less string stretching, but string buzzing may perhaps sometimes reduce intonation tuning.
Place the strings as close as possible to the frets; if some buzzing on next higher fret can be heard increase the distance slightly. There may be some string buzzing permitted at frets higher than twelfth fret. The more expensive guitars can have their strings closer to the fretboard and so have better intonation tuning. The intonation tuning error due to string stretching is (T2+(T (2 yi/s))2)1/2-T, where T is the open string tension of the ith string, and yi is the distance between the side of the ith string and the twelfth fret peak. From these equations can tell that intonation tuning improves as string tension T reduces and distance yi between string and twelfth fret reduces with offsets d minimized.
Need to keep yi small as possible for first string to achieve intonation tuning. If the distances yi between strings and frets are too large, intonation tuning will be impossible.

, Fret the string at the 12h fret and pick it. The pick should be moderate, not too hard, not too soft. When fretting, pay special attention to fret only as hard as is necessary to prevent the string from buzzing.

Even with a standard un-scalloped fretboard it is possible (especially on guitar) to bend the string sharp several cents by fretting too hard. In normal playing it isn't generally an issue, but for this process you need maximum accuracy. When you play that string at the 12th fret, observe your tuner. If you are sharp (too high) or flat (too low) your intonations are off and an adjustment will need to be made.

, Adjust the saddles. Depending on the type of saddles you have determines if you turn the adjustment screws for the each saddle clockwise or counterclockwise.

If the note on the 12th fret is sharp, that would mean that the saddle for that string needs to be moved back away from the headstock.
If the note on the 12th fret is flat, that would mean that the saddle for that string needs to be moved forward toward the headstock.
Compare the twelfth fret note to the corresponding twelfth fret harmonic pitch with electronic tuner for meter. This is decent intonation tuning for notes between nut and twelfth fret range.

, After you make a saddle adjustment, you will need to repeat step 2. Make sure the entire instrument is still perfectly in tune.

Once you have completed step 2 again, re-fret the 12th fret on the string you just made the adjustment on and check it on the tuner. You should see that it is not in the same place anymore. If the 12th fret note isn't perfectly in tune while the open note is perfectly in tune, you need to repeat step 4 until it is.
Tune the open string note and check the fifth fret note with a mechanical pitch pipe. If the fifth fret note is still a little sharp (high), move the bridge (bridge saddle) back a third of a millimeter. Play some songs on one string and adjust the string length at the bridge accordingly if the intonation does not work well. If it is perfect you are done with that string.
Tune the first fret notes by adjusting string tensions; and compare the second to twelfth fret notes of a string with the chromatic electronic tuner pitches. Compare notes of a string with an organ/chromatic pitch pipe link below, and if most of the higher pitches are too high relative to pitch pipe pitches and first fret note, lengthen string by about 0.2 millimetre at bridge, or if too flat (low) move bridge forward (toward fretboard).
Repeat this until the notes from nut to twelfth fret of a string closely matches the references pitches. Better intonation tuning of a string occurs when the twelfth fret, sixteenth, and nineteenth fret notes pitches equal their corresponding harmonic pitches.
Fine tune by playing ""Mama's Pearl"" (J5) guitar lead on one string.

, Repeat the process as outlined here for each string on the instrument tuning frequently., Once you have the instrument completely set up, play a nice fat major barre chord. Listen to all of those overtones you've been missing! Now, kick on your distortion and notice how your guitar is suddenly 300 times more powerful."

If you are a beginner, you can also just use something soft and curved like a piece of polystyrene., Turn the tuning key and feel the tension loosen for each string. Once loose, unwind the string off of the tuning post and remove., Use the built-in notch of the string-winder to remove each pin. Once the pin is out you can also remove the string from the bridge of the guitar.Secure the ball end of the string against the underside of the bridge to sustain tone. Do not let the ball end sit on the tip of the pin or it will work itself loose., Face the groove of a bridge pin toward the sound hole of the guitar and slide the pin into the hole together with the string. Simultaneously pull on the string with your other hand and as you push the pin through the hole and into place., Tighten the string as you push it about 3 inches through the tuning post. The string should be pulled towards the bridge.About 2 inches from the corresponding machine head, cut the string so that you can poke it through the machine head shaft., Tighten the string by using the string winder on the appropriate tuning key but don’t look to tune at this time. Just tighten the string to ensure you have set it correctly., Usually, it is best to tighten the strings in the order of: 5A, 4D, 3G, 2B, 1E.Stretch your strings to ensure that they are correctly set., Most beginners will need to tune their strings several times with a tuning machine. Consult your local music shop if you are having difficulty using a tuning machine., Loose wire can be dangerous and make it difficult to play your guitar. Cut any excess wire to ensure easy hand movement.

, Use a guitar support for the neck of your guitar as you lay it on a flat and solid surface. If you don’t have a guitar support, place the neck securely against your torso as you unwind the strings.

, Create some slack and cut the strings either by the midpoint of the body of your guitar or by the neck pickup. Once cut, remove the string.


Make sure you do not drop the guitar.

, In a Gibson style guitar, take the new string through the tailpiece that is underneath the body. For a non-locking Fender-style, thread the new string into the tremolo cavity.

, Using the tuning key, turn the hole in the post perpendicular to the neck of your guitar.

, As you pull the string, measure approximately 3 inches of slack to allow for winding. Keeping your thumb on the other side of the hole, stop threading the string through the post once it hits your thumb.

, Use one hand above the post and the other below it to twist an S around the post. Smoothly twist the string in a clockwise motion.


Twist in the opposite direction for high strings on 3 + 3 headstocks.

, Wrap the part of the string that’s already through the post, around the post and between the excess string between the nut and the post. In other words, take the top part of the S and turn it into a P and place it through the bottom part of the S.

, Loop the two ends of the string, crimp, and tighten toward the top of the headstock. Tighten and lock the string into place with this technique.

, Take a string winder and place it on the tuning key. Turn clockwise and, just below the post, use your thumb to feel the string get taught.

, Repeat this process as needed. Use the 5th fret to start this process. Pull the string up with one hand and move up the fretboard with the other. Retune the other frets.


The string will give as you stretch. Repeat the process until the string no longer slips.
Remove excess string with wire cutters once you’re satisfied with the stretching.

",How to Replace a Guitar Neck1,"


Older flattop acoustic guitars often need their necks reset. Fortunately, this repair does not require a new guitar neck. Unfortunately, attempting to reset a guitar neck without proper training in this type of repair can result in significant damage to the instrument.
You will know your guitar neck needs to be reset if you’re experiencing high string action that you can’t fix with adjustments to the saddle or adjustment rods.;
,


Bolt-in or bolt-on guitar necks can be replaced fairly easily. A glued guitar neck will likely require a professional to perform the replacement because he can evaluate the type of glue and use the proper steaming or heating method to remove the neck.

,


When ordering a new neck, make sure it works with your guitar. This may require a phone call to both the manufacturer of the neck and the guitar manufacturer. A loose fit will negatively affect your guitar’s tone.

, You’ll need to restring the guitar after replacing the neck.

,,,


Some guitar necks will be wedged into their pockets so tightly, this process can be arduous. Be patient and continue wiggling the neck until it becomes loose enough to pull out of the pocket. Being too rough can chip the pocket.

, If the neck is too wide, use sandpaper or a dremel tool to widen the pocket. Do not force it in.


If you’re not confident in your abilities to shape the guitar’s pocket, it’s time to take the guitar into a repair shop. Removing too much of the pocket’s body can destroy the instrument.
Measure both the neck and the pocket before you begin sanding so you know exactly how much to remove.

Dry off your guitar.",How to Remove Stickers Safely from a Guitar," There are several different cleaners, such as Goo Gone or Goof Off, that are manufactured specifically for removing adhesives. These products are designed to remove sticky adhesive without damaging the finish of the material. Both products are safe to use on wood and plastic., There are many chemicals that can be used to remove stickers from a guitar. One of the most effective chemicals to use is naphtha. Naphtha can be found at most hardware and general stores. Common products made with naphtha include lighter fluid, shoe polish, and fuel for camping gear.Use caution when working with naphtha as it is very flammable. Do not use it near an open flame.
You could also use acetone, commonly known as nail polish remover, in place of naphtha.

, Create a homemade solution using coconut oil and baking soda. Combine two parts coconut oil with one part baking soda in a small bowl. Although it may seem strange to use an oil to remove a sticker, you are creating a solution similar to Goo Gone or other commercial adhesive removers.A homemade solution will be free of many harmful chemicals that are found in commercial adhesive removers.
You can add a few drops of sweet orange essential oil for extra degreasing power and a more pleasant scent.

, Before you apply generous amounts of adhesive remover to your guitar, pick a small section on the back of your guitar to test the solution. You want to be sure that it doesn’t tarnish the finish of your guitar.

, If you are removing a larger sticker, using a larger scraping instrument, such as a CD, may be more effective than your fingernail. Removing some of the sticker will allow your adhesive remover to better reach the sticky adhesive on the back of the sticker.Paper stickers will allow an adhesive remove to penetrate the paper surface.
Plastic stickers will repel the adhesive remover and not allow it to reach the sticky adhesive surface on the back of the sticker. It is important to try to remove as much of a plastic sticker as possible before applying an adhesive remover.
Be careful to not lift any of the guitar’s finish while attempting to remove the sticker.

, Wrap a cloth or paper towel around your finger and dip it into your adhesive remover. Rub the solution on the sticker in a circular motion. Coat the entire sticker with a liberal amount of the solution.If you are using a spray bottle of adhesive remover, spray the cloth or paper towel instead of the guitar. This will prevent you from getting remover in parts of the guitar where you do not want the remover.

, Using your fingernail or the CD, continue to remove the sticker from the guitar. Start working to peel back the sticker from one corner. The adhesive remover should have softened the grip of the adhesive, allowing you to remove the sticker with little residue leftover., Once the sticker is removed, used the adhesive remover to remove any leftover residue. Use care to not scrub too hard and tarnish the surface of the guitar.

, Some of the adhesive solutions listed above can list a film or residue on your guitar. Dampen a clean cloth with some water and wipe off the surface of your guitar.

, Using a clean cloth or a clean portion of your adhesive remover cloth, dry off your guitar’s surface. If you notice any remaining adhesive, repeat the steps to remove it. Be sure to completely dry off your guitar to avoid tarnishing the surface.

Oil the tuning pegs regularly.,
Clean rusted strings.,
Allow a professional to perform any electrical repairs.,
Repair damage to chromed parts promptly.,
Store the guitar in its case as often as possible.,
Monitor the humidity in which the guitar is stored.",How to Prevent Guitar Corrosion," A simple and effective way to prevent corrosion to your guitar's parts is to play it with clean hands. The oil and dirt that naturally accumulate on your hands can eventually lead to degradation and corrosion of your guitar's strings, frets, tuning pegs, pots, and other metal parts that are touched frequently.;
, Although strings can be replaced easily, prolonging their life will improve your guitar's tone and save you money. Give the strings a quick wipe with a clean, lint-free cloth after each playing session to remove sweat and oil that can lead to corrosion.

, The tuners on a guitar are usually made from steel, and the constant rotations to which they are subjected increases wear and exposes the metal to rust and corrosion. To prevent this, apply a few drops of machine oil (available at hardware stores) to the tuning pegs every few months.

, Use aluminum foil; rub it against the rusted string to clean off all surface rust. Wipe down with a kitchen towel or cloth. Repeat as often as required to remove any rust., If any of your guitar's electrical components ever malfunction or need to be replaced, hire a professional technician to perform the repair. Working on your guitar's electrical parts yourself can lead to faulty connections and exposed wiring, both problems which can lead to accelerated corrosion.

, Most metal guitar hardware has a chromed finish, but bits of this finish can be stripped away through bumps and scratches. If the underlying metal is left exposed, it can develop rust and quickly deteriorate. Have a professional technician repair the metal's finish promptly before rust develops.

, If a guitar is left exposed to the air, the continuous buildup of dust and atmospheric pollutants will eventually mar the finish of both the body and the metal hardware. Keep your guitar in a hard shell case when not in use to preserve and protect its finish.

, Ideally, a guitar should be stored at a relative humidity between 45 and 55 percent. Higher or lower moisture levels can cause cracking or warping of the wood and corrosion of wiring and metal parts. A dehumidifier can be used to control the humidity in your home. You can also place small desiccant packets inside the guitar's case to control humidity.

Remove the guitar's strings.,
Remove the guitar's neck.,
Remove all of the guitar hardware.,
Pull out the bridge studs.,
Set all of the fasteners and hardware aside and label them.",How to Repaint a Guitar1," You can clip the strings away using your usual pair of string clippers. Unfortunately, there is no way to repaint a guitar with its strings on, so note that you will likely need to readjust your truss rod once you reassemble the guitar.;
, Bolt-on guitar necks are fairly easy to remove - simply unscrew the bolts at the back of the neck joint and wiggle the neck free. Glued necks cannot be removed, but most glued necks are painted to match the guitar body anyway, so you'll want to leave it on so that you can repaint it.

, The output jack, pickups, bridge, knobs, strap buttons, and pickguard can usually be removed using a screwdriver or Allen wrench. On some models, the output jack and knobs will be wired to the pickups through holes between each cavity, and so you'll need to snip the wires to remove each piece. Make sure to record how they where wired so that you can put it back together correctly.

, Some guitars may not have these, and the bridge can simply be unscrewed from the body. Removing bridge studs can be difficult because they're pounded into the wood. You can use a soldering iron to heat them up so they expand, and then when they cool down they will contract and be easier to remove. You can use pliers to pull them out, but this can scar the finish and ruin their appearance.

, The refinishing process can take a few weeks to a few months, so make sure each screw or bolt is labeled. This will prevent confusion when you try to reassemble the guitar.

You have two options.,
Use an orbital sander to remove the bulk of the finish.,
Use sandpaper or a sanding sponge to remove the remaining finish.,
Smooth the guitar's body.,
Remove all sanding dust.,
Apply grain filler.,
Finally, use mineral spirits to completely remove all oils.",How to Repaint a Guitar2," Sand away the existing finish completely, or just rough up the existing finish to allow a fresh coat of paint to stick. If you're going with a stain, translucent paint, or if the original finish is much darker than the color of paint your using, then you need to completely remove the existing finish. Otherwise, if you're using a solid paint, then you only need to rough up the surface. Please be aware that most guitar builders agree that a thick coat of paint is tonally inferior to a thin coat of paint.

, Fit an orbital sander with coarse-grit sandpaper and work over the entire guitar body using smooth, circular strokes. This technique should allow you to remove most of the lacquer and paint on the guitar's body. You may be tempted to use paint stripper. However, this is a very messy and toxic process, and most paint strippers are not capable of removing the rock-hard polyurethane that modern guitar manufacturers use.

, For curved areas that are difficult to reach with the orbital sander, use loose sandpaper wrapped around a large dowel, or you can use a small sanding sponge. Coarse-grit sandpaper is best for removing the paint and lacquer.

, After using coarse-grit sandpaper to remove the finish, you'll want to smooth out the wood using progressively finer grains of sandpaper. Work the entire body over with medium-grit sandpaper (such as 120-grit), and then go over it again using fine-grit sandpaper (such as 200-grit).

, A vacuum cleaner with a hose attachment can remove most of the sanding dust. To remove additional dust, you can use a can of compressed air to spray it away or wipe it away with a moistened cloth or tack cloth.

, Unless you are going for the unfilled look, an option you have when working with mahogany or other porous woods, then you will need to fill in the grain with a filler or putty. Choose a water or oil based filler that will match the paint or finish you are using.

, Do not touch the guitar's surface after this step, or oils from you fingers will ruin the finish.

"
"
Be sure to paint in a dust-free environment.,
If painting indoors, be sure to use a quality air mask.,
Don't paint in an area where overspray will affect furniture or floors.,
Placing the guitar body inside a large box on top of a portable worktable (such as a TV tray) will greatly reduce overspray and will protect other items in the area.,
Choose the paint or stain you want to use.,
Apply a few coats of primer/sealer.,
If using a solid color, apply the coats of paint.,
If using a stain, wipe on the stain.,
Apply a clear coat to the guitar.,
Wait.,
Polish the finish.,
Reassemble the guitar.",How to Repaint a Guitar3," There are numerous air particles in the great outdoors even on a clear day that will seriously mar your finish-- including bugs that will be drawn to the odor!, Always wear goggles., A workshop, garage or similar enclosed area will suffice., The opening of the box should be to the side so that the paint is contained within the box and the guitar can be slid in and out. Putting newspapers inside the box provides an easily-replaceable painting surface., For solid color finishes, use a paint that is very durable, such as polyurethane or nitrocellulose. Nitrocellulose is the gold standard and can be found in auto parts stores or online, but it dries very slowly. For a stained finish, use a water based stain and a nitrocellulose or polyurethane clear coat OR an oil based stain with an oil based finish such as Tru-Oil. Sprayed on finishes will prevent unsightly brush marks.

, Use a primer that matches the type of paint you are using. Aim to apply 2 or 3 thin coats rather than 1 thick one, as this helps the primer to dry properly and prevents drips.

, Apply two thin coats of paint, allowing the manufacturer's recommended drying time in between. Wait one week for the paint to completely dry before applying the clear coat.

, First, wet the guitar body with a little bit of moisture to ease the application of the stain and prevent blemishes. Apply the stain following manufacturer instructions, and apply as many coats as needed to achieve the look you're after.

, Again, nitrocellulose is recommended. Apply each coat as thin as possible, building up a clear, protective finish on the guitar. You may need to apply as many as a dozen thin coats to achieve a factory finish. Apply them in sets of three thin coats with a few hours in between coats and a week in between sets. The first set of coats need to be very, very thin. After that you can apply them on a little thicker but make sure to avoid runs.

, If you chose a nitrocellulose or polyurethane finish, wait 3 to 4 weeks for the paint to harden. If you chose an oil based finish, such as Tru-Oil, you only need to wait a few days!

, Wet-sand the hardened finish starting with 400 grit, then 600, 800, 1000, 1200, 1500, and finally 2000. Do not skip any steps or else tiny pits, scratches, ans swirls will be in the finish and will be impossible to get out. Do not sand through the clear coat and into the color coat especially on the edges of the body where the clear coat may be thinner; this is the reason why the clear coat requires so many coats. Stop here for a satin finish. For a mirror-like shine, use a buffing wheel and buffing compound such as 3M ""Finesse It"". Alternatively, you can use ""Micro Mesh Finishing Pads""—a set of fine grit sanding sponges with #1500, 1800, 2400, 3200, 3600, 4000, 6000, 8000, and 12000 grits—that can be used to give a high-gloss finish without needing an expensive buffing tool.

, Screw or bolt together the guitar's hardware. If you had to snip any wires to disassemble the guitar, you'll have to solder them back together. This is now also a good time to replace the cheap factory components, namely the potentiometers, with high quality ones. You can even buy a new pick guard or make a custom one. Once assembled, the guitar can be cleaned and shined using your usual guitar polish. Now just string it, tune it, and enjoy your beautiful new instrument!

Unwind your strings and check for damage.,
Unscrew the machine heads from the neck.,
Find the right tuners.,
Take out the jackets.,
Replace the tuners.,
If you want, take legal action or notify the manufacturer.",How to Replace Guitar Tuners1," Under tension, strings can whip out at you, and so could your tuners. Check for damage not only on your guitar but also on you, basically because the broken metal can act just like a knife or a wild game trap. Once you look for any damage proceed to unwind the rest of your strings and take all of them off the tuners.;
, For most guitars, use a Phillips head screwdriver to take out all of your tuners. Keep the machines that did not break for anything that could happen as you play more.

, It is best to replace all of your machine heads at once rather than just the broken ones, to minimize the chance of something happening in the future. Obtain the correct tuners of your choice that would fit your guitar best. Do some research on-line or talk to an expert for help choosing the best tuners for your guitar.


Some guitars, such as older Les Paul's, have pressed on metal jackets or bushings inside the drilled holes to protect the tuner and help it keep clean. You can leave these in the headstock or take them out.

, To take these out, you will need a hammer and some other kind of striking tool, such as a punch, or something that will fit inside the hole and the jacket. For best results, hold down the neck and gently tap out the jacket. All guitars are different and will have different ways their parts are assembled. If you are still unsure about your guitar, research more about it.

, To replace the correct machine heads, reverse your actions from when you took them out. Be cautious so as not to destroy anything on your guitar or replace a tuner wrong. If you have questions or are unsure about the process, research your specific guitar or talk to an expert before trying to do it yourself, as you could potentially damage your guitar.

, A tuner is not going to break just from you normally handling and playing your guitar. The reason why a tuner would break is because it was defective or faulty or somebody had not assembled it properly and/or the guitar had been dropped there and left a small fracture. If you were hurt by the fragments of the broken tuner, it might be a good idea to take legal action. If you were not hurt, save the broken tuner and notify the manufacturer, as they might compensate you for any damage to your guitar.

Purchase a chromatic tuner.,
Tune your guitar to the standard tuning.,
Hold down the 12th fret on the high e string and see if it's in tune.,
Continue to check each of the strings on the 12th fret.",How to Intonate a Guitar1," Even if you're a seasoned guitarist, it's still hard to hear exact notes and it can be difficult to determine whether strings and notes are flat or sharp. A chromatic tuner is an electrical device that you can plug into your guitar using a standard 1/4"" instrument cable. Chromatic tuners can be purchased at most music stores or online.If you can't buy a tuner, there are apps online that may also act as a tuner.Some tuners will work with electric and acoustic guitars.
If you want a more exact tuner, you can purchase a strobe tuner.;
, The standard tuning on a guitar starting from the thickest string, or the 6th string, is E, A, D, g, b, e. Plug the 1/4"" cable from your guitar to the input of the tuner. Strum the top string on your guitar and rotate the tuning knobs on the headstock until your tuner's needle is in the center of an E note. Continue to do this to all of your strings until your guitar is in the standard tuning.Tuning your guitar in standard tuning will enable you to hear if notes down your neck are flat or sharp.

, Now move down your neck and hold down the 12th fret on the high e string. The note should be the same as it was when you played the open string. If the needle on the tuner is left of the 12 o'clock position, your string is flat. If the needle is on the right side of the 12 o'clock position, it means that your string is sharp., Check the other strings to see if they are in tune just as you did with the high e string. Take note of whether your strings are flat or sharp so that you can make the proper adjustments when setting the guitar's intonation.

Familiarize yourself with the snare drum.,
Examine the uses of the bass drum.,
Get to know the hi-hat cymbals.,
Acquaint yourself with the ride cymbal.,
Introduce yourself to crash and splash cymbals.,
Familiarize yourself with the toms.",How to Understand the Parts of a Drum Set," The snare drum is perhaps the most important drum in any drum set. It is a rather shallow drum fitted with a set of tightened wires underneath the resonant head; this gives it its signature ""crack"" sound. In nearly any musical style, the snare drum is played on the back beats (beats 2 and 4 in a 4/4 time signature).;
, The bass drum, often called a kick drum, fits hand-in-glove with the snare drum. The bass drum has a large diameter, most commonly 22 inches (56 cm), and thus has a deep, resounding sound. It is played with the drummer's right foot using a pedal. It is often played on the upbeats (beat 1 and 3 in a 4/4 time signature) to balance the snare drum back beat.

, If you could only choose 3 components for an extremely basic drum set, the best choices would be a snare drum, bass drum, and a pair of hi-hat cymbals. The hi-hats are played in eighth- and sixteenth-note patterns to fill in the drum groove of nearly any kind of music. They can be closed and opened using a foot pedal located under the drummer's left foot.

, The ride cymbal is the largest cymbal in a drum set, usually with a diameter between 20 and 22 inches (50 - 56 cm). It is the next most important component after the snare, bass, and hi-hat. Ride cymbals are used for the same eighth- and sixteenth-note patterns as the hi-hat, but provide a more sustained, ""washy"" sound. Ride cymbal patterns are especially prevalent in jazz drumming.

, Crash cymbals are smaller than ride cymbals, usually boasting a diameter between 15 and 18 inches (38 - 45 cm). Splash cymbals are even smaller and higher in pitch, with diameters ranging from 6 inches to 14 inches (15 - 35 cm). These cymbals are usually struck on their edge, providing a loud, piercing impact that is ideal for ending drum fills.

, The remaining drums in a drum set are called toms or tom-toms. These drums do not have snare wires underneath them, and so provide a more mellow sound than the snare drum. Toms can be mounted over the bass drum or supported on a set of adjustable legs. They are most often used in drum fills, but can also form crucial parts of the groove in Latin American and Afro-Cuban drum patterns.

Loosen the strings to give the saddle freedom of movement.,
Loosen the screw on the saddle if your string is flat.,
Tighten the saddle screw if the note is sharp.,
Retune your strings.",How to Intonate a Guitar2," The saddle is the part of your guitar that's below the pickups, on the opposite side of your headstock. If you've never adjusted the guitar's intonation, your saddle might be more difficult to move. Before you adjust the position of the saddle, loosen the strings so that you don't create unnecessary tension on the strings which could cause them to snap.If the saddle is being difficult, you can wiggle it back and forth with your fingers until it moves.

, If your note is flat, you'll want to move the saddle up towards the headstock. Loosen the screw a quarter turn to sharpen your note. You may have to do this several times before the string on the 12th fret is correct.

, Use a screwdriver to tighten the screw on the saddle if the string that you're playing is sharp. This will move the saddle away from the headstock and will flatten the note on the 12th fret., Once you've made adjustments with your screwdriver, you can re-tune your strings. Test the note on the 12th fret and take note of whether you corrected the problem. If you turned the screw too far, your string might be off the correct tuning. If this is the case, then loosen the string again and adjust the screw more until the string plays in tune, on the 12th fret.

Try to use different strings.,
Take your guitar to a luthier.,
Replace the guitar's saddle.",How to Intonate a Guitar3," While rare, it's possible that the manufacturer made an error when producing your strings. Intonation may also be affected by old, worn out strings. Before adjusting your guitar's intonation, make sure that the bad intonation is being caused by your guitar and not your strings., A luthier is a person who specializes in repairing stringed instruments. Because an acoustic guitar's saddle doesn't move, you can't simply tighten or loosen screws as you would do on an electric guitar. If you value your acoustic guitar and don't want to damage or destroy it, take it to a certified professional instead of trying to modify the guitar yourself.A luthier will be able to adjust neck and bridge to affect the action of your guitar, file nuts down, and replace the bridge completely if need be. These are all things that should be handled by a professional.Even if you have a cheaper acoustic guitar, it still may be worth it take your badly intonated guitar to a luthier rather than attempting to fix your guitar yourself and breaking it.

, Replacing your guitar's saddle can fix the intonation. To do this, remove all of the strings from your guitar. Use needlenose pliers to loosen the saddle from its casing and carefully pull it from its hole. Then, push your new saddle into the saddle hole firmly to secure it. Once it's in place, restring your guitar and tune it.

Before replacing your saddle, make sure that you measure the length of your existing saddle so you can get the right size."

You don't have to remove the strings completely but loosen them enough so that you have room to work under them on the neck., The guitar nut is on the top of your neck, near the headboard. It's what the strings are pulled over before they are wrapped around the tuning pegs. Find a screw that's about the same height as the guitar nut and one that can fit snugly under the strings of your guitar. You may have to search around at a hardware store until you find the right sized screw., Cut off a piece of the screw by bending it back and forth with needle nose pliers. You need the piece of the screw to be small enough so that it can fit under a particular string but not affect the rest of the strings on your neck., This piece of metal will affect the strings intonation. The higher that you slide the screw towards the nut the higher your pitch will be. The closer that you slide the screw to the fret, towards the bridge, the lower or flatter the note will be. Continue to adjust the metal until your note is in tune."

Thread the string.,
Loop the string around the machine head.,
Be sure to wind it correctly.,
Tighten the string.,
Keep winding, wrapping the string under itself so that each loop pushes the previous loops upward.,
Check to make sure the wrap looks right.,
D not cut the extra ends of the strings off.",How to Make Guitar String Wraps on Your Guitar2," After securing the eye-side of the string at the bridge of the guitar, bring the straight end up to the headstock and thread it through the eye of the machine head.


This method is intended for steel-string acoustic or electric guitars, and is not designed for classical guitars' horizontal tuning pegs and nylon strings.

, Make sure it passes over the free end of the string for the first pass. Looping the loose string over the machine head and holding it with your right hand is easier than turning the key to get this first loop in place. It allows you to easily make adjustments to the amount of slack, which determines how much string you'll have for the wrap.

, Make sure the string is winding around the tuning head so that winding it counter-clockwise will tighten the string (machine heads on the right side of the headstock - usually for higher strings - should turn clockwise instead). This will keep a uniform tuning direction and align the strings properly. It should become pretty obvious if you're doing it wrong.

, Hold the first loop in place with your right hand and wind the machine head to tighten the string (sometimes you have enough slack that you can cheat and throw your second loop over the top, too, but it can be tricky to keep the first one in place when you try this).


This time, your string should pass under the loose end.

, Three or four loops is enough for the lower strings, but more loops are needed for the plain steel (usually the B and high E) strings to keep them from slipping.


This might be a good time to mention that it takes practice judge how much slack you needed to start with so you'd have just enough to finish the wrap and tune the string. If you don't have enough string, just back up and try again with a little more slack to start.

, The final result should be a loose end of string sticking out from the machine head, pinned between one loop passing over the top and the rest of the wrap pushing up from below.

, Leave them on throughout the stretching process (you can tuck them out of the way to make it easier) and don't cut them until your guitar is staying in tune on its own; you never know when you might need to unstring and restring one or two of them because of something you notice while tuning; it's best to be safe.


Leave about 3/4-inch of the string sticking out from the machine head so that you can bend the ends of the strings back on themselves (needle nose pliers help a lot). Anyone who's ever gotten the tip of a guitar string accidentally jammed under their fingernail knows why this is helpful.
This method has the advantage of reducing the amount of string used to make a secure wrap, thus reducing stretching and break-in time. (Plus, you don't have to do as much winding and there's no ugly masses of string on your machine heads.)

Inspect the quality.",How to Make Your Own Guitar String Protectant,";
, Place them one to two at a time on the wood on each side, and tape them down or clamp them to your workplace. If you wish, you may tape near the ends of the string instead of estimating the length from the nut to the bridge.

, You will need to get your fingers in between the strings, it is recommended you seat the strings 1 to 4 inches apart and stretch them so they do not touch the workplace underneath. Use your guitar neck as a reference.

, To do so, it is best to swab a drop of glue on your finger and rub it into your fingers with some water. It should feel like the same as liquefied soap, and have your towels ready.

, With the watered down glue on your fingers, coat the string as you would be using a handrail, but going back and forth to get an even coating. Once you have made 5-6 swipes, get all the droplets of glue off the string and wait for the glue to dry. Set up another workstation if you need to, and continue on until all of your selected strings are coated.

, You may sacrifice a little of your sound when you coat your strings, but it is a better outcome than dirt-filled, grimy, and rusted strings. If you so wish, coat the strings once again to have a different feel to the strings.

Blow away dust with a compressed air spray.,
Wipe your guitar with a warm, damp cloth.,
Use an old toothbrush to clean your frets and bridge.,
Condition your fretboard.,
Use glass cleaner for metal parts.,
Use guitar polish if necessary.,
Scrape off the guitar's nut.",How to Maintain Your Guitar1," You can buy a can of compressed air at any office supply store. These typically are sold to clean computer keyboards, but also work well for cleaning between your strings and the body of the guitar or the fretboard.Use compressed air before you clean your guitar with anything else to get rid of loose particles on the surface. This should minimize the work you have to do with other cleaning supplies.;
, A damp cloth will remove most of the dirt and chemicals that have collected on your guitar. Never spray liquid on your guitar, as it can damage the wood. The chemicals in cleaner also can damage your guitar's finish.Wring the cloth out well before you touch your instrument with it. You don't want to see any liquid on the surface of your guitar as you wipe it.
It's best to wipe your guitar down every time you finish playing it. Keep a soft cloth, such as a microfiber shammy, in your guitar case. A clean T-shirt or a cloth diaper also work.

, When a toothbrush is no longer suitable to clean your teeth, give it a second life brushing the grooves in your fretboard to clean out the grime that accumulates on either side of the frets. Much of the buildup is dead skin cells, so look for it around the frets of the chords you play the most often.This method is typically easiest when you have the strings off your guitar, so you can get to the frets easier. You don't want to brush your strings with the toothbrush.
Don't get the toothbrush too wet, or spray any water or other liquid on the surface of your fretboard before cleaning it with an old toothbrush.

, Over time, grime can build up on your fretboard, making it more difficult to play. After you've cleaned your fretboard, wipe it with lemon oil to bring it back to new condition and protect it from future damage.Don't use general furniture polishes or the same polish you use for the body of the guitar. The wood on the neck of your guitar is different and needs to be treated differently.

, You probably have a number of metal parts on your guitar, especially if you have an electric rather than an acoustic. You can get rid of any gunk or residue on those with plain commercial glass cleaner.Spray your cleaner on a cloth first, then clean the parts. Don't spray cleaner directly on your guitar.

, If you feel the need to polish the body of your guitar after cleaning it, use a polish specifically designed for guitars. It may be a little pricier than other polishes, but ordinary furniture polish can destroy your guitar's finish.Squirt the polish on a rag first and then wipe down your guitar – do not spray polish or any other wet substance directly on your guitar.
Use a different cloth to clean your guitar body than you used for your fretboard. You want to avoid cross contamination, both of cleaners and of dirt and grime.
Make sure you choose a polish that matches the finish of your guitar. Guitars with a flat or satin finish require a different type of polish than those with glossy finishes.

, Build-up of dead skin cells and dust on your guitar's nut definitely affects your guitar's sound and playability. Whenever you change your strings, take the opportunity to also clean your nut before you set the new string.Take care, and don't use any solvents or chemical cleaners. Dental floss works to get the gunk out of the groove where the string sits in the nut.

Test your technique.,
Raise the action.,
Check for a warped neck.,
Have a professional adjust the neck (recommended).,
Check the nut slots.,
Repair worn frets.,
Raise the buzzing string with a piece of paper.,
Lower the pick-up.,
Check the strings.,
Look for loose objects on or inside the guitar.",How to Get Rid of an Unwanted Guitar Buzzing Noise1," If you are a beginning guitar player, make sure you have the correct technique down. Pressing the strings too lightly or placing your finger too far behind the fret may cause buzzing.;
, If a string is vibrating against the fret even on an open strum, one solution is to raise the strings higher above the fretboard. Most modern electric guitars have a bridge that can easily be adjusted using an allen wrench — and may even have controls for individual strings. If you can't figure out how to do this, look for an online video covering this process for your exact model of guitar. Acoustic or classical guitars typically have an ivory or plastic ""saddle"" at the bridge instead. You'll need to replace this piece with a higher saddle to raise the action.


Note that adjusting the bridge will alter the intonation of the guitar.

, Hold the body of the guitar, leaving the neck free, and point the top of the neck toward your eyes. Close one eye and look down the bass and treble sides of the wood to check for small bends. If your neck is bent, the truss rod inside the neck needs adjusting. (Most classical guitars do not have truss rods, but these should be built so the risk of warping is low.)


For another test, lay a straightedge perpendicular to the frets. If the neck is straight, the straightedge should be able to touch every fret at once.
You can also try sliding a piece of paper under the strings. If the paper catches on one string but not the others, the neck is probably bent.

, If your neck seems bent, you may need to adjust the truss rod inside the neck, or re-shim the neck where it meets the body. These repairs can easily damage your guitar if not performed correctly. Take your instrument to a guitar repair shop unless you have the proper tools and experience to adjust it yourself.


A luthier (guitar repair technician) can usually adjust a truss rod within 24 hours, and may charge anywhere from US $30 to $300. This can get more expensive if other repairs are required.
If you find someone willing to do a quick adjustment for free, consider giving a tip anyway; that's a good person to befriend.

, At the top of the neck, each string fits into a slot cut into the nut. If one of these slots is too deep, that string may buzz. This problem might show up as a fault on a new guitar, or after someone has filed the nut slot down. If you think this could be the issue, take the guitar to a repair shop to have the nut replaced.

, Some frets may wear down faster than others, causing the strings to rattle. This is usually obvious from visual inspection. Completely replacing a run of twelve frets can be somewhat expensive, and unfortunately rarely produces perfect results. You can save money by buying a fret replacement kit online, but be prepared for many hours of extremely precise gluing and sanding.

, Think of this fix as the ""spare tire"" for your guitar. You won't want to rely on it for long, but it will get you through your next rehearsal. This works best if only one or two strings are buzzing, but you can try it on any number of problem strings.


Loosen the buzzing string enough to pop it out of the nut. The nut it the bar running across the strings at the very top of the fretboard.
Pull the string slightly to one side.
Fold a small piece of paper and stick it in the string notch.
Pull the string back over the paper. Tighten the string slowly back into the proper position.
Tear away any paper sticking out.
If the string still buzzes, try raising it higher with a stack of paper three or four layers thick.

, If an electric guitar's pick-up is too high, the strings may buzz against it. Try lowering the pick-up to see if that fixes the problem.

, If the strings are attached too loosely at either end, they may buzz. Make sure they are knotted properly at the neck, and that their attachment point at the other end has not started to break loose from the guitar body.

, If none of the steps above match your problem, it may not be the strings buzzing at all. A pick, paper clip, or even a label that's slipped out of position will vibrate inside a hollow body guitar, causing unwanted noise. A loose object stuck on the outside of the guitar can also cause a problem.


To remove an object inside a hollow guitar, use needle-nose pliers. You can also press a soda straw against the object, then inhale to hold it against the straw as you lift it out. Take care not to cut yourself on the strings, or push them so hard they break.

Start with the drumstick in your hand in French Grip, with the stick's center of gravity just above the index finger.,
As you give the stick a small push over your index finger with your thumb, keep your index finger in the same place and bring all your other fingers away.,
Let the stick fall over the index finger and place your middle finger on the stick.,
Let your index finger push the stick over to rest between your middle finger and third finger so that the tip is facing upwards again.,
Let the stick fall between your third and little finger.,
Work the stick back up the opposite way to get back to the thumb.,
Push the stick around and hold it in between your thumb and index finger again.",How to Twirl a Drumstick1," If you're unsure what the French Grip looks like:









Thumb on top of stick, running parallel
Weight of stick rests on your second knuckle of the middle and index finger.
Wrist and fingers are firm but relaxed.;
, This is the momentum that carries through the entire spin. Try to keep these motions calm and relaxed, just moving your fingers and not your whole hand.









This is often the hardest thing to start, and you may want to dedicate some time just to this ""mini-spin"" before moving on., The stick should now be between your index and middle finger, with the tip of the stick facing downwards.









This sort of ""push, roll, switch fingers"" motion will be used throughout the spin.

, Keep the pattern alive, making these half spins as you move down your hand. As you get faster, these will chain together for the dazzling pros spins you're looking for.








, The tip should be facing you again. By now, the stick may be cheating forward, trying to slip out the tips of your fingers, slightly angling your hand up as you practice, letting gravity help a bit, may make things easier.








, Simply reverse the earlier motion, alternating fingers as you rotate the string. When it gets to passing the stick to the thumb again, instead, bring your middle finger under, so that your little and middle fingers are under the stick facing you, and your third finger is on top. Then let go of your little finger and bring it around with your index finger again. You're ready to repeat!








, This kicks you off on the spin, keeping it moving over and over. Keep practicing this up and down, getting used to chaining them together smoothly.

Make sure the tension is even across the drum.,
Do the same thing to the bottom head of your drum.,
Maintain your snares.,
Tune to the body of the drum.,
Listen for a smooth single tone.,
Tune the bottom first.,
Consider using a rotisserie or a lazy Susan.",How to Tune Your Drums," Drum keys are used to tune drums and cost about two dollars at a music store. If you're going to play drums, it's a good idea to get one and make sure your kit is in tune with itself. To start tuning your drums or changing the heads, all you need is a stick and your drum key. Turn the snares off and you're ready to start.If you have any drummer friends, you can ask if they have spare keys to lend or give you.
Consider using two drum keys at rods opposite each other on the drum. You'll be able to tune faster and will get a more even tension (so long as you continue keeping them across from each other as you move diagonally around the drum).;
, Using your key, begin loosening tension rods. Give a rod about half a turn and then loosen the rod diagonally across from it (not the rod next to it). Then go back and loosen the rods again. Continue doing this until you can loosen them by hand. You don't want to loosen them one at a time, but instead evenly loosen them half a turn each, just keep going around the drum until you can start loosening them by hand.









Avoid completely loosening the rods at once. Remember to use a diagonal pattern when loosening and tightening the rods. This will prevent the rim from bending.

, Once you've removed these parts, wipe the inside and edge of the drum with a dry piece of fabric. Tap the inside of the drum to check that your drum's lugs are tight and check your mounting hardware.








A loose drum lug can cause a buzz in the head.
Also, wipe the new drum head to make sure everything's clean and not dented.

, Center the new head on the drum and put the rim and tension rods back onto the drum. You might want to place the rim back on the drum in the spot it was originally since the rim's shape has probably moved to fit in that position. Tighten all of the tension rods evenly using your hands (no drum key yet) and keep going until all of the tension rods are finger tight.


Keep your tension rods and drum lugs clean and lubricated. To lubricate the rods, rub a little oil, petroleum jelly, or paraffin wax over them., Prevent your drum from repeatedly going out of tune by pushing down in the center of the drum with your fist. Do this 5-10 times. Don't worry, you won't break it. You should be able to put a good portion of your body weight onto the drum. Don't be alarmed if you hear popping or glue-cracking sounds.Make sure the tension rods are all still tight and adjust them as needed. Once you've got the new head seated and the tension rods relatively tight, you're ready to start tuning the drum.

, Start with the tension rod closest to you and turn the drum key half a turn tighter. Do not move onto the tension rod beside it. Instead, turn the tension rod that's directly across from the one you've already turned half a turn. The next tension rod you are going to tighten is the one to the left of the tension rod you started on. Then go directly across the drum from there and continue this pattern.









Keep going around the drum until all of the tension rods are totally even and the drum has the sound that you want it to. You may have to go over all of the tension rods several times or until you reach the desired tone., Many drummers and techs will hit the drumstick or finger against the body of the drum (the side, not the part with the head) to listen for the overtone, then try to match the pitch when tuning the head.You can also listen to recordings in order to try to match the tone you want.









If it is a new drum head, tension the head higher than your desired pitch and press hard in the center. You will hear the pitch drop. This seats the head, as well as pitches it correctly to get the great crack sound out of the snare. The top head should be tightened slightly tighter than the bottom when you're finished.

, Go around the drum and tap an inch away from each tension rod with a drumstick. Fine tune the rods to make sure the point you're hitting makes the same tone all the way around the drum. Tighten or loosen the rods depending on the tone you're getting.









If you don't like some of the overtones that your drum is giving off, you can use some form of dampening (moon gel, drum gum, o-rings). You don't want to use dampening as a solution to poor tuning. Instead, dampening can be used to enhance good tuning., Depending on your taste, it will either be the same pitch as your batter, or vary a little. Follow the same process, periodically taking the time to smooth out the wrinkles in the plastic covering with a cloth or a napkin as you bang on it. This will help make the tone uniform across the drum, so the wrinkles won't settle out later and change the sound.


To make sure your bottom and top heads have the same pitch, try muting the top head while you check the tune of the bottom. To do this, try setting the top head face-down on a drum stool while you check the bottom head., The snares themselves are also very important, so it's a good idea to keep them in pristine condition. Try to tighten them so that they are flat across the skin of the drum. Too tight and it will bow off of the middle, too loose and it won't touch at all.


A good rule of thumb is to tighten the snares until just after they stop rattling., It's important that you take the time to bang on the body a few times to get a sense of the pitch of the individual drum, and keep tuning until you've matched it.









Tune the smallest tom first so that the top head is close to the pitch you want. Move on to the other drums, continuing to match the top head pitch., Follow the same procedure as you would for the snare drum, smoothing out the head with a cloth and tapping around the perimeter of the drum surface to check for evenness. Use your ears and really focus on the sound. The ideal tone should smoothly and evenly fade into a single note.









You may find that a particular tension or particular pitch is really good for your drums. Keep going until you find it. Experiment with what sounds you get out of your kit by comparing the tunes between the bottom and top heads.
Tuning both heads to the exact same pitch will bring out a very resonant sound. Tuning the bottom head to a lower pitch than the top head will make a dropping sound. If the bottom head is tighter and has a higher pitch than the top head, you will get a very constant tone with little resonance., The bottom head is the part of the drum that creates the projection and sustains more than any other part. It's the most important part of tuning the drum kit, because the batter heads won't sound right if you don't take the time to accurately pitch the bottom heads.









Tuning the bottom will make it easier to tune the top heads since the bottom will be reverberating at the correct pitch.

, Get something that rotates to set the drum on and turn the drum as you work. Setting your drum on a spinning surface will make it easier to turn the drum and can make the process go faster. This way, you can turn all the keys and shift things around easier. With a spinning surface, you won't need to shift around on the floor on your knees.


A rotating table setting, called a ""lazy Susan,"" would be perfect for the job, or use a rotating desk chair or bar stool. Get comfortable, because tuning can take a while.

Tighten any loose screws.,
Keep your guitar in its case.,
Avoid moisture.,
Watch light and temperature.,
Buy a set of strap locks.",How to Maintain Your Guitar2," With play, vibration may loosen screws and bolts in your guitar. Over time these can affect the sound of your guitar or your ability to play it. Check for loose screws before you store your instrument.Keep the appropriate tools in your guitar case so you can easily tighten any loose screws when necessary.

, The best way to adequately protect your guitar from the elements is to store it in a hard case or gig bag at all times when you're not playing it. Even having it on a stand or hanging on the wall means it could be bumped or damaged.A hard case generally is best, but if you don't have a hard case, a soft case or gig bag is better than simply leaving your guitar out and exposed to the elements.

, Your guitar is made of thin wood that can be warped or damaged fairly easily, so any kind of moist or humid conditions are not your guitar's friend. If you live in a humid climate, consider storing your guitar in an area with a dehumidifier.Ideally, you want to store your guitar in a place where the relative humidity is somewhere between 45 and 55 percent.

, Light and temperature also can damage your instrument. Leaving your guitar in direct sunlight could cause the finish to fade over time. Try to keep your guitar in a space between 72 and 77 °F (22 and 25 °C).A rapid change in either temperature or humidity can cause your finish to crack. While this won't necessarily affect the sound of your instrument, it can weaken the wood and make it more vulnerable to damage.

, If you frequently play your guitar hanging from a guitar strap, a set of strap locks is essential to maintain your guitar and keep it looking its best. Straplocks, as the name implies, lock your strap in place so that your guitar doesn't pop off the strap.Without straplocks, your guitar could come loose from the strap while you're playing and you could drop it as a result. Accidental falls like that can damage your guitar's finish or crack the body.
Strap locks are relatively inexpensive, and you can pick them up at any guitar or music store. If you know you're going to be playing your guitar on a strap, it's best to go ahead and get a set when you buy your guitar.

Wash your hands before playing.,
Wipe your strings after playing.,
Use string cleaner.,
Replace your strings regularly.",How to Maintain Your Guitar3," Much of the dirt and grime on your guitar strings comes from your hands. You can keep them in their best condition by making sure your hands are clean before you play your guitar.Use hand sanitizer right before you play, which will kill any bacteria on your hands as well as get rid of oils on your hands which can damage your strings and your guitar over time.

, Even if you took care to keep your hands clean, your strings still will get dirty as you play your guitar. Wiping them down with a dry, soft cloth will keep them in their best condition.Use a small cloth such as a dish towel of a cotton diaper. You can wrap the cloth gently around the string and clean all sides.

, If you haven't been wiping down your strings regularly, or if they have a lot of gunk on them, you can purchase a string cleaner and lubricant at your local guitar store or music shop.String cleaners aren't strictly necessary. If you wipe down your strings every time you play your guitar, you should be fine. Never use commercial all-purpose cleaners on guitar strings.
If your strings have significant buildup and cleaning them doesn't seem to make much of a difference, you may be better off simply replacing them.

, Strings build up dust and residue over time. How often you need to change your strings depends to some extent on how often you play your guitar. Regardless, you should be changing them at least once every couple of months.Don't take all your strings off at once – you can cause your guitar to loose tension, resulting in a bent neck that will seriously affect your guitar's sound. Instead, remove and replace the lowest two strings, then move to the next pair.
When you replace the strings, take the time to clean the frets and oil the fretboard if necessary while the strings are off your guitar.

Test the amp.,
Switch cables.,
Check the cable input on your guitar.,
Wriggle the cable to test for loose wires.,
Check the wiring on the pick-ups.",How to Get Rid of an Unwanted Guitar Buzzing Noise2," Turn on the amp with nothing connected to it. Slowly turn up the volume and see if you hear that buzzing noise. If you do, there may be a loose or frayed wire inside the amp. If there is no buzzing noise, you can rule out the amp as the source of the problem.


Always unplug the amp before inspecting the internal wiring. You may be able to solder a loose wire yourself if you can identify the problem.
If you think the buzzing could be feedback, move farther away from the amp when you play.
Failing capacitors may cause a distinctive 60 cycle ground hum, especially in tube amps.

, If you haven't already, try plugging in your guitar using a different cable. An old or worn cable is a common cause of noise, although this is usually a 60 cycle ground hum rather than a buzz.

, If this screw feels loose, tightening it can sometimes solve the buzzing issue. If this doesn't work, turn the guitar upside down, carefully unscrew the nut, and catch the connector. Check the connector's connections and re-solder them if necessary.


Volume controls, treble and bass controls, and any other knob can be another source of loose wiring. Remove the knobs one at a time, remove the nut holding the potentiometer in place, and inspect the wiring.
Never access these areas while the guitar is face up, or the connector could drop into the body of the guitar.

, Plug the cable into your guitar and wriggle it. If you feel something loose inside the instrument, there is probably a loose wire causing an electrical short. This could be at the pickups, the pots (potentiometers), or input jack. If you are up to the task, you may remove the back plate and solder the loose wire back into place. However, the soldering iron can easily damage the guitar's finish and other wiring. If you are not experienced at soldering or cannot adequately protect the surrounding area, take the guitar to a professional luthier for repair.

, Depending on your model, you may need to remove the strings in order to unscrew the pickups. Once you have removed them from the guitar, check for loose connections and frayed wires. Make sure the connections are not touching any other metal objects.

Hold the drumstick between your thumb and index & middle finger, palm up.,
Push the stick towards you with your middle finger.,
Drop your index finger as you push with the middle.,
Keep your thumb stable as the stick spins.,
Catch the stick after one full rotation.",How to Twirl a Drumstick2," This trick spins the stick on top of your thumb, ending it right back where it started. To do it, make a peace sign with your index and middle finger, then place your thumb on top to hold it in place.Your thumb should be in the middle of the stick so that it is evenly balanced.

, You actually have to push pretty hard. Remember, the goal is for the stick to spin on top of your thumb, like a coin spinning on a table. You'll need enough force to get it moving.

, The index finger is just going to get in the way if you don't slightly drop it. Keep it down to avoid stopping the stick from spinning, but don't overdo it. All you need to move is your finger.


Many beginners overcompensate here and move their whole hand, or really stick their finger out of the way. A half-inch down is usually enough.

, The stick should both rotate and move across your thumb -- away from your middle finger and towards the index.

, Your thumb should never move throughout the entire motion. As the stick completes its rotation, it will start to slip down towards your index finger. Bring the finger back up in position to pin the stick back under your thumb. You're done!"

Find your maximum and then work from there. Know that most people recommend not paying less than $300 for a new guitar, even if you're a beginner, as the quality will make it sound inferior and difficult to play.Of course if you can find a good deal on a used guitar, there might an exception to the $300 rule.;
, If you're on a tight budget, an acoustic guitar with a laminate top might work for. They're cheaper than solid wood tops, but they don't vibrate as well. This means that the sound won't be as rich and the volume not as loud.You can tell whether a guitar is a laminate top or solid wood top by feeling the top. Laminate tops will feel and look glossier and smoother than pure wood.

, It's important to consider how much experience you have with guitar because it will help determine how much to spend. An amateur will expect to upgrade guitars eventually, and doesn't have much need for the subtle aspects that make a high-end guitar better than a budget guitar. If you're more experienced with the guitar, you'll want to aim for something in the $700-$1200 range. If you're a pro, something in the $1200-$2500 range will last you a lifetime., Most well-known guitar brands have models for every price point, but some brands do certain price points better. Some brands to look into includes Fender, Yamaha, Epiphone, Takamine, Washburn, Taylor, and Martin.Fender and Yamaha both make several models of acoustic guitars that are rated highly for beginners on a budget.
Washburn, Epiphone, and Takamine all make great acoustic guitars for those with a little higher budget. These are great brands for intermediate players.
Taylor and Martin make many high-end acoustic guitars. These guitars will be more expensive but for good reason.

, Acoustic-electric guitars have electronics in them that allow them to be plugged into amplifiers. Non-electric acoustic guitars need to be rigged with a microphone accessory or played into a microphone in order to be amplified or recorded. Acoustic-electric guitars are often more expensive than their acoustic counterparts, but if you'll often be playing in a band or in live settings to an audience, it's something to consider.Acoustic-electric guitars often have a built-in tuner as well, which many people find useful.

, There are three basic body styles: Classic, dreadnaught, and jumbo.Classic style guitars are often used for classical guitar playing. Guitarists who do a lot of finger picking sometimes prefer them because they have a lot of clarity and balance between the highs mids and lows.
Dreadnaught guitars project more than classic guitars. Some describe them as boomy sounding. This is the most commonly played type of acoustic guitars for singer-songwriters, folk artists, and rock artists.
Jumbo guitars are kind of like a cross between the shape and quality of classic guitars and the size and loudness of dreadnaught guitars.

, There are many possible reasons you might want to look at travel or mini-acoustic guitars. If you're shopping for a child, a regular sized guitar might be too big. If you have smaller hands and find it difficult to make chord shapes on most guitars, travel and mini-acoustic guitars might be for you., If you're a beginner to playing guitar, you might want to consider bringing a friend along to the store. Especially if you're buying a used guitar, a friend who has some experience with guitars will help you make a good decision.


If you don't have a friend knowledgeable in guitars with you when you go to the store, you can also ask someone who works at the store for help. The people working at the music shop will likely have a wealth of information on guitars and can help you find a guitar that's right for you.

, The type of wood that the guitar is made out of will affect how it sounds. Knowing what you want out of your guitar's tone will help you make a decision because then you can look for the wood type that best suites you. Some of the common wood types are:Spruce is the most common type of material for acoustic guitars. It has a bright tone and remains clear even when played loudly.
Cedar is favored by finger pickers because it delivers warm, rich tones that work well with fast picking.
Mahogany has a strong sound that some describe as punchy. It is often used by blues players.
Maple is very transparent and doesn't color the tone of the strings very much.
Rosewood has an overall darker tone, with rich highs and mids and strong lows.

, Ultimately, it will be difficult to decide whether a guitar is right for you without playing it a while. This is why shopping in person is preferable to online shopping. Most guitar store owners understand this, and they will allow you to play any guitar you're interested in., There are many factors to look at when inspecting a guitar. Of course overall comfortability and how it sounds to you are important, but look for some of these things as well:Knock on the guitar's body. An echoing sound usually means it will have greater bass, if a less echoing sound is produced it will normally sound bright.
Check the action height. This is how far the strings are from the fretboard. The higher the action, the more difficult it will be to play. Look for a guitar with low, even action.
Check the intonation. This means how well the guitar is tuned up and down the neck. Check this by playing an open D chord and then the same chord on the 14th fret. If it sounds out of tune, there may be a problem.

, Buying a used acoustic guitar is a great way to find a balance between quality and price. But if you do buy used, you should spend some extra time inspecting the guitar before you buy it. The first thing you should do is look for any obvious signs of damage on the body and neck. Small cracks and chips are okay, big ones are not.Play every note on the fretboard and listen for rattling or dead spots. Rattling could be sign that the bridge is loose and dead spots could be sign that the fretboard needs work.
Look at the neck from the side. It should be practically straight. A little bowing is okay, but a lot is not.
Where the neck connects with the body should be flush, and if you push gently on the neck, it shouldn't give at all.
Gently push down on the body, all around. Listen for creaking, which could be a sign that the glue on the braces inside the guitar is loose.

Put your guitar away.",How to Clean an Acoustic Guitar," You’ll need a few things to effectively clean your guitar. Gather up two soft cloths (you can use an old shirt, or even buy a cloth made especially for this), a spray bottle containing a bit of detergent and water, lemon oil, guitar polish, something pointy (like needle-nose pliers or a pen), and if your guitar has a shiny finish, a buff cloth.;
, Loosen the strings by rotating the tuning heads “backwards,” as if you were tuning to a deeper pitch. Do this until the string is as loose as it can go. Next, remove the pin for that string from your bridge. If you have a string-winding tool, you can use the edge to get underneath the pin and help guide it out. Finally, pull out the string. Repeat this for all six strings.








When this has been done to all the strings, take the bridge pins, and put them somewhere safe.
After you removed the strings, you can throw them away, or clean them and reuse them.

, Using one of your soft cloths, remove dust from the body and neck of your guitar. Be sure to wipe down the front, sides, and back. Use a gentle motion.








You'll want to perform a thorough dusting of your guitar every time you change your strings, or roughly every 1-3 months with regular play.

, Using a pointer finger beneath your soft cloth, apply some elbow grease to any creases on the guitar. This includes: around the pick-guard, around the bridge, and where the headstock meets the neck. Remove any dust that may be lingering in these areas., Take your soft cloth and gently wipe off each of your tuning keys. If your tuning keys seem especially dirty or oily, you can spray a bit of detergent water onto a cloth and wipe off your tuning keys with that.Another option is to use a bit of window cleaner on a soft cloth to clean tuning keys.

, Take your “pointy item” (such as open needle-nose pliers or a pen) and wrap your soft cloth around the point. Scrape your new tool across each fret, starting at the base of the headstock and moving down. This cloth-covered sharp edge will remove stubborn dirt from each fret’s edge.








You'll want to give your guitar an extra deep cleaning at least twice a year.

, Grab your second soft cloth and your lemon oil. Apply a few drops of oil to your cloth. Then, using a circular motion, begin oiling your fretboard. Begin near the headstock and make your way down. You’ll want to do this at least couple of times per year.







, Using your lemon oil and the same cloth, apply some oil to your bridge. Once again, use a circular motion. The oil should absorb right into the wood. If there is any excess oil left on your bridge, simply wipe it off with the dry side of your cloth., Locate a thin piece of paper. Then, take a look at your bridge. Try to insert the paper underneath the bridge, even if it's only the corner. Ideally, you won’t be able to. However, if you can, it means that your bridge is slowly coming off. If you find yourself in this situation, locate a luthier (or stringed instrument specialist) and invest in getting your guitar fixed.

, If your guitar is particularly dirty, you may want to use a bit of soap. Grab your spray bottle with mild detergent in water. Then, moisten your dusting cloth. Do not spray the guitar directly, as the idea is to use as little water as possible. Use this moist cloth to wash off any dirt from your instrument., There are numerous guitar polishes on the market. Essentially, there are three types: water-based cleaners, creamy cleaners with fine abrasives, and oils. Select any of these, and apply a small amount to your soft cloth. Then using a soft, circular motion, gently oil the front, sides, and back of your guitar. Use only a small amount of oil. You will want it to absorb into the wood.








Look for a polish made for your guitar. Different formulas exists for wood and lacquer finishes.
There are special polishes designed to remove cigarette smoke residue.
You can search for your model number online to get more details on your guitar’s specifics and find out the best product to use.

, However, if your guitar has a shiny finish, you will want to follow up with a buff cloth. Using your buff cloth in a circular motion, you will polish your guitar to a beautiful shine. Do this on the front, back, and sides.








, As you polish your guitar, inspect the finish for any imperfections. If you happen to spot any cracks, take your guitar to a repair-person as soon as possible. This will prevent a tiny ding from transforming into an unsightly spider pattern., Slip the ball end of a new string into the appropriate hole in your bridge. Then, insert a pin into the hole. Be sure the groove in the bridge pin is facing the sound hole of the guitar. Do not allow the ball end rest on the tip of the pin, otherwise it will work itself loose.


Push the pin into place while also pulling on the string (with your other hand). You will feel the string and pin snap into place.

, Thread the other end of your string into the appropriate slot on the tuning post. Push the string approximately three inches through the post, and tighten. The string should be pulled in the direction of the bridge.








, Begin winding the string with your string-winder (or twist the tuning key). You will want 4-5 neat windings on the post with no overlaps. Repeat this method with the five other strings.








, Using an electronic tuner, tighten each string until it plays the proper note. This will ensure that your guitar is ready to be played next time you pick it up. If you are a seasoned musician, you will be able to tune your guitar by ear.








, You may be tempted to keep your guitar out on display, but the most effective way to keep your guitar clean and healthy is to put it away in a hard case. This will extend the life and vitality of your instrument for many years."

To check the straightness of the neck, hold it at eye level and look straight down the neck, or lay it flat on a table or bench and look at the neck at eye level.
There's another way to check the straightness of your guitar neck, but you'll need a helper. Press a string down at the first and 14th frets. Have your helper line up a ruler next to the string you're pressing down at the sixth fret. There should be approximately 0.10 of an inch (about 2.5 millimeters) between the string and the fret.;
, The truss rod is a slim, steel rod inside the neck of your guitar. You can find the adjusting nut either at the peghead or through the sound hole, depending on how your guitar is designed.An adjustable truss rod is either one-way or two-way – also known as single-action or double-action. A one-way rod will only straighten the neck of your guitar against string tension and upbow, while a two-way rod can also correct a backbowed neck.
With a one-way truss rod, there's no way to adjust a backbowed neck. However, if you have a newer guitar you typically have a two-way truss rod, since these became standard in the 1980s.

, Particularly if your truss rod is only accessible through the sound hole, you'll want to loosen your strings before you attempt to adjust your truss rod. This will make it easier for you to get a tool into the sound hole and turn it. However, don't remove your strings entirely.Check the truss rod to see what kind of tool you're going to need for the job. Typically it will either have a nut or a hex key slot. If your truss rod is only accessible through the sound hole, you'll probably want a longer allen wrench or nut driver to turn it so you're not trying to stick your whole hand in the sound hole.
If your truss rod is accessible from the headstock, you don't need to worry about the sound hole. You just need to unscrew the screws holding the truss rod cover in place. When you're adjusting the truss rod from the headstock, don't loosen your strings – you need to have them tuned to pitch so you have appropriate tension on the neck and can see the extent to which you're adjusting it.

, Use your allen wrench or nut driver to slowly and gradually turn the truss rod screw. You may need to lubricate the truss rod nut, especially if you have an older guitar or the truss rod has never been turned.Remember ""righty-tighty, lefty-loosey."" Turn the truss rod screw to the right to straighten an upbow, and to the left to straighten a backbow.
Place a mark on the nut so you can tell where it was when you started. Don't turn the screw more than 1/8 of a turn at a time. This will keep you from adjusting too much.

, After you've made your first 1/8 turn, you'll need to retune your guitar so you can check the distance between the strings and the frets and see whether you've corrected your problem.This isn't something you can just eyeball with loose strings. The neck must have correct tension on it for you to be able to tell whether you've straightened it enough or not.

, If the first 1/8 turn didn't correct the upbow or backbow in your guitar's neck, give your truss screw another 1/8 turn, then retune your guitar and check again. Keep note of the mark you made. Don't turn the screw more than one complete rotation, as this can cause major damage to your guitar., If you want to lower the action on an acoustic guitar by filing the notches on the nut, you'll need a set of nut files that corresponds to the gauge of string you're using. Since each string is a different thickness, you'll need a set of six nut files – one for each string.If you don't have a set of nut files, you can typically find them at a luthier supply shop, as well as at many music stores.
You'll also need a feeler gauge so you can measure the action at each fret and file accordingly.

, If it isn't already, you need to make sure all six strings of your guitar are in tune before you start measuring the action at the nut and making adjustments., Place your feeler gauges right on top of the first fret so you can determine how much the nut needs to be filed down to lower the action.Use a ruler to measure first. It should be 0.3 inches or about 7.5 millimeters from the string to the first fret.
If it's greater than that, keep checking the distance using larger feeler gauges until the string moves because the gauge is too big to fit. The distance between the string and the fret is the thickness of the largest feeler gauge that doesn't cause the string to move.
Repeat this with each of the six strings.

, Carefully loosen the string, only enough to pop it out of the nut without damaging the nut. Loosen it just enough that you can easily pop it out and thread it along the side of the nut., Find the nut file that corresponds to the sixth string and get a piece of plastic or masonite to protect the headstock so you don't file the headstock while filing the nut.Place your nut file in the notch and file carefully, going in the direction of the headstock at the same angle.
Only file a small amount at a time, as you cannot replace material once you've filed it down and you don't want to file it down too much.
When you think you're done, replace the string, tune it, and measure it again to see if you need to refile or if you've corrected your problem.

, Once you've got the notch for your sixth string filed correctly, you'll want to repeat the process with each of the other five strings to lower the action on your guitar at the nut., The saddle is basically a long, skinny nut, usually made of bone or a synthetic material, that is inlayed at the bridge. To lower the action on an acoustic guitar you don't have to adjust the bridge in any way, you only have to adjust the saddle.The saddle serves the same purpose as the nut, controlling the height of the guitar strings. If you lowered the action at the nut, you must also lower the action at the bridge or your tone will be off.
The strings are strung through the bridge, and their tension holds the saddle in place. It isn't glued in place.
Saddles may be either straight or compensated. A compensated saddle is curved to compensate for the tone of the strings and help keep the guitar in tune. This is why if you want to lower the action at the bridge, you always sand down the bottom of the saddle, never the top.

, Use a ruler to measure the distance between the sixth string and the 12th fret. You'll also want to measure the first string at the 12th fret. You don't need to measure the other strings.Most acoustic guitars take 2/32 of an inch (about 1.5 millimeters) of action for the first string and 3/32 of an inch (about 2.3 millimeters) of action for the sixth string. If your action is more than that, you'll want to lower it.

, Since the tension from the strings holds the saddle in place, you won't be able to take it out without first loosening the strings of your guitar. However, you should be able to leave them on the tuners.Use your string winder to detune your guitar until the strings are loose and floppy. Don't take your strings off the tuner.

, You'll have to take your strings off if you want to get the saddle out, but there's no reason to remove all of your strings. This will just give you extra work and make the process take longer.The lower three strings should give you enough room to slide the saddle out, provided the other three strings are really loose and floppy.
You still don't need to remove your strings from the tuners unless the strings go through the bridge. If you do have a string-thru bridge, this process will take a little longer because you'll have to remove the strings from the tuners as well to get the saddle out.

, Once you've removed the lowest three strings, you should have enough room to slide the saddle out of its slot on the bridge. Do this very carefully. If it's wedged in there tightly, you may need a pair of pliers to grip it and pull it out safely without damaging your guitar., Once the saddle is out of the bridge, you're ready to lower your action at the bridge. Take care to keep it even as you sand it, because an uneven saddle will ruin the tone of your guitar.One way to do this is to place a piece of double-stick sand paper on a level table or work bench.
Get the ruler you used before and determine how much you want to sand down your saddle. Mark your saddle across with a pencil. Then all you have to do is sand until you get to the pencil line.
Keep in mind that if you sand your saddle down too low, your strings will be too long. You also don't want to take more than you need. Be cautious and only sand down a little at a time. You can always repeat the process if you didn't sand enough, but if you sand too much you won't be able to put it back.

, Lift your strings and carefully slide the sanded saddle back into its slot. Then replace the bottom three strings that you removed and retune your guitar. Measure the action again and play your guitar a little bit to see if you like it. You may want to repeat the process and sand down a little more. Keep in mind that industry standards are just that, but each guitarist has their own personal preference for how much action they like.

Understand the difference between steel and nylon strings.,
Be aware that the material you choose will affect the sound you get.,
Check the gauge.,
Decide if you'll choose strings with coating.,
Check the price.,
Go to the store and try out some strings.",How to Choose Acoustic Guitar Strings," It's important to know that using strings meant for acoustic guitars on a classical guitar will ruin the neck. The tensions of the strings and guitar necks are different, so you can't use classical strings for an acoustic guitar either. Classical guitars usually have nylon strings. The bass strings look steel but the insides are made of nylon fibers. This article will discuss steel strings.


If you play a lot (on stage), you may want to stick with 80/20 bronze. Phosphor strings tend to last longest.;
, The three most commonly used materials are bronze, phosphor bronze, and silk and steel. There are other materials too, but these are the main ones.
Bronze strings are sometimes called 80/20 bronze because they are made with 80% copper and 20% zinc. They can be used for all styles of playing. They have a bright sound that fades away quickly after a few hours of playing. Bronze strings are the most commonly used strings.
Phosphor bronze strings are bronze strings with phosphor added. They can also be used for all styles. They have a warmer sound that lasts longer than bronze strings.
Silk and steel strings produce a soft, mellow sound. They produce less tension and come in lighter gauges so they are good for vintage guitars that require special strings. They are quieter and less durable but easier to play.

, The gauge of the strings is how thick the strings are. It’s usually measured by the diameter of the 1st string (high e string) in thousandths of an inch. The gauges might be listed in numbers ( .009, .010, .01) or words (extra light, light, medium…) or both. A higher gauge (thicker string) has more volume, longer sustain and a generally warmer tone (more overtones, less bright, less treble versus bass volume), but is harder to play due to the increased force required to fret and bend strings.Lighter gauges are easier to play but sound thinner and sometimes buzz. Beginners should start with light or extra light for easier playing; you can upgrade when you feel more confident playing.

, Some guitar strings are made with coating to make them last longer. This also creates a smooth texture that some players like and some hate. Coating helps your strings last longer and resist rust. Coated strings usually cost more than regular strings. Coated strings can also come in colors like red, blue, black, and more.

, Buy strings that you can afford. They don’t need to be super-expensive to sound great. Make sure no one is ripping you off on price. A set of cheap strings can cost as low as a few dollars. Average strings can cost you anywhere from $5 - $15. Expensive strings may cost up to $50- but remember, you don’t need extremely high-quality strings to sound good. Researching strings using a review site or guide can be helpful in determining which sets represent high value.

, Test out different materials and gauges and see which works best for you. Ask the store clerk and your friends what brands they use.


Pick out two brands minimum and try them both. Compare both and choose the one you like most.
Repeat this process until you have found a few brands and types you like best. It's also helpful to have another brand to fall back on when you visit the shop and it's out of the ones you usually like to buy.

Serious guitarists might change weekly or monthly, while anyone else should aim for new stings every 2-3 months.;
, Take a picture of the strings when they're still on, or simply look up a picture of your guitar online. Note the path of the string from top to bottom. While it isn't too difficult, you want a good sense of how the guitar is strung before you get started., Turn the tuning or peg to loosen each string, just enough that you can unwind the rest by hand. You'll know you're loosening if, when plucked, the string sounds deeper. While you can also cut your strings off, this method eases tension gradually and allows you to reuse an old string if one breaks while restringing.


You should just work on one string at a time to begin. Remove one, replace it, then move on -- this protects your neck from wild changes in tension., Once the string is removed from the peg, follow it down to the bridge (right below the acoustic hole). It should be pinned down by a bridge pin. Push the string slightly towards the pin to loosen it, then pull the pin straight out. This should bring the end of the string with it.


Do not yank the strings or pins out violently.
Some acoustics are simply threaded through the bridge, and can be pulled out of the opening with ease., Remove all of the dust, grime, and dirt from the neck of your guitar with care. This protects new strings, and will make your guitar feel a little faster. For deeper cleaning, purchase a bottle of fret-cleaner from your local music shop and spray that on according to the manufacturer's instructions.

, You should get the ""regular"" or ""lite"" strings if you have any doubts or are unsure what to buy. While some guitarists use heavier gauges or odd string configurations to get specific sounds, you can't simply grab a set of strings if your guitar is not made for it. Strings that are too heavy for your guitar will warp or bend the neck without proper adjustments. Just get the regulars or lites until you know more.


In general, you want your high E to be a "".008-.0011"" thickness. This is for medium, lite, and extra lite strings.
If you use drop tunings frequently, like a drop D, you might want heavier strings. Talk to the staff at your music store for specific questions and recommendations., Give yourself plenty of room to work, laying the guitar down on a table so that you can adjust it comfortably. You should let the head hang off the edge of the table so that it is easy to turn the pegs. Place a towel or blanket between the guitar and table to prevent scuffing or scratching.

, This hole should point away from the string so that it is parallel to one of the frets. If you were playing the guitar, the hole would be pointing towards your face.

, In general, most guitarists will begin with their heaviest string, the top E. It will often me marked as ""6th string,"" or by the highest gauge number (usually around .050). Remember, it is often easiest to work one string at a time, so just take care of this one for now. While you can start with any string, the thickest one is the most resistant to snapping, so it is the best one to start practicing with.

, Simply curl the end of the string around your finger and place it in the bridge, whole. Then re-insert the peg that holds the string in place and pull on the string -- this while lock it into the bridge and secure the bridge pin., Slide it in the opposite way you took the other strings out, then run it through the hole in the tuning peg, pulling the string away from the guitar. Make sure you leave 2-3 inches of slack as well -- you don't want the string to be completely taut before you start tightening.


The tuning pegs aren't marked, but you should just replace the strings in the same order you took them out. The first string will go into the bottom left peg, if you're looking straight at the guitar., Grab a hold of both ends of the string, then crimp them around the tuning peg by pulling down on the right hand (the end of the string by the neck) and up on the left hand (the very end of the new string).


Your right hand will be coming towards your body, away from the headstock.
Your left hand will be pushing up, in towards the other tuning pegs on the head.

, Grab the end of the string and loop it underneath the main body of the string, then wrap it up and over, pulling it down towards the top of the guitar. Think of it as snaking the end of the string around the point where the string meets the peg -- like a DNA double-helix., Place your index finger down on the string an inch or two before it before it meets the tuning peg. Hold the string down onto the head of the guitar. From here, turn the tuner counter-clockwise to tighten it. Make sure that your string is winding around the peg in a uniform manner as it wraps around.


Use a tuner to slowly get yourself up to the proper tension. Once you've got most of the slack out, turn the tuner out and check the string as you tighten., Once you've got the first string on, keep going on the rest of the strings, working through the entire packet. Most acoustics are strung with a 3x3 pattern, where the head has two sets of three tuning pegs. For the second set, simply reverse the instructions, replacing right hand with left and up with down.

, Use wire cutters to snip away the excess string. You may want to leave a 1/2"" to allow deeper tunings, though it is not strictly necessary., Strings stretch out as they get used to the tension. It will stop after a day or two, but you can speed the process up with regular tuning to get the string into the right length..

Play the guitars in a music store to find the sound you like best.,
Ensure that the guitar is comfortable and easy to play.,
Select a guitar that fits your style.,
Know the difference between laminate and solid-topped guitars.,
Check the construction up and down the guitar to ensure a well-built guitar.",How to Buy a Good Acoustic Guitar," You're expected to play a guitar before you buy it, so don't be shy. Better yet, play 10 different guitars, comparing the sounds from one to the other. Do you want a deep, big sound, or do you want a brighter ring to your notes? Play a few chords and notes up and down the fretboard to measure the responsiveness at different points, as well as ease of play.









If you've never played guitar before, it might not be wise to drop a lot of money on a great guitar until you know it will stick. For the first few lessons, ask some friends if they can lend a guitar. Once you know some chords and songs, you can test them on guitars you might buy.
When you're serious about a guitar, take it into a sound-proofed room to test out. Strings on the other guitars in the room will create sound when you play a guitar (sympathetic vibration), making the guitar sound better than it actually is. Most music shops will have an amp room in the back.;
, If you like the sound but can't play it, opt for a smaller guitar. A key point is that the bottom groove should fit comfortably on your right thigh. Sitting upright, you should be able to strum with your elbow at right angles to the neck, and your wrist flexible. But there are some other, more subtle things to check on a good acoustic as well:










The Action: How high above the frets are the strings? On good guitars, they will be close. Cheap guitars have ""high action,"" meaning you must push much harder to play a note.

Neck Width: How easily can you reach the top strings with your fretting hand?

Body Size: Dreadnaught guitars are big, and have a similarly rich sound. A concert acoustic is much smaller and thus brighter. If you're playing alone, sitting down, the big size can be nice. But if you're part of a band and like to move, you might want something slimmer.

, Different types of acoustic guitars are best for different genres. While the descriptions below are generalizations, they will be helpful when picking out a guitar for beginners:










Traditional Acoustic: This is the classic guitar, with a big body and an open sound hole. It is used a lot in folk, rock, country, and pop music, but can be heard in almost anything.

Traditional with Pickup: If you see a panel with buttons and a quarter-inch input jack, this means you can plug the guitar into an amp without sacrificing the rich acoustic tone. If you plan on playing with a band, they are highly recommended. Very versatile.

Electric-Acoustic: These hybrid guitars are used in jazz and world music, and can only be adequately tested through an amplifier. Generally more specialized., The most important thing for your guitar's sound is the piece of wood on the top. There are a lot of woods used for different guitars, depending on the sound you want, but the most important thing to note is whether or not it is laminate or solid-topped. If you don't know, or it doesn't say, ask a store clerk.










Solid: This is one or two matching pieces of wood, lined up with the grain in the guitar. It produces a clearer, richer sound than laminate, but is more expensive.

Laminate: Is 4-5 pieces of thin wood pressed together, usually plywood. It has lower volume and tone quality but is still a good option for a cheaper first guitar.

, If you've played the guitar, love the sound, and feel like it fits your style and comfort, then it's likely a good guitar. There is one final set of checks, however, that make sure it is well built and ready to buy:









Tuning pegs are easy to turn.
There is no excess glue, chips, or marks of other shoddy construction.
All pieces feel securely fastened, no wiggle or movement.
There is an adjustable truss rod. Ask the store clerks if you cannot find it.
The neck (not the fretboard on top of the neck) is roughly even with the top of the guitar.
String height is low, especially at the first fret."

Look from the bridge, where your strings begin under the sound hole, up the neck to the tuning keys. A good light source for this visual check would be a well-lit window. If your guitar isn't actually warped, you should only notice small dips in the shadow cast by your guitar strings on the fretboard at the fourth, fifth, and sixth bottom frets. Other variances in the shadows cast by your strings on the neck are an indication of warping.


In some cases the neck might not be warped, but the frets of your guitar may have become somehow misaligned. If this is your case, you should notice one or more frets higher or lower than other surrounding frets.
Sometimes frets become misaligned because of warping in the neck of your guitar. When you notice misaligned frets, inspect the area carefully.
The upper frets of your guitar should be almost perfectly straight, if not perfectly straight. Deviations in the top frets are a good indication that you have a warping problem.
Don't look to the wood of the neck and fretboard or its edge to determine warp. This part of your guitar can become worn down over time from playing, and can make the neck appeared warped even when it is not.;
, Rotate your guitar so that the base is facing away from you and your view begins with the headstock, where the tuning pegs are. Hold your guitar level with your eyes but pointed at a generalized light source. Just as you did previously, use the shadows cast by the strings to evaluate the straightness of the neck. There should only be small dips in the shadows only on the fourth, fifth, and sixth bottom frets.


Sometimes warping is harder to notice from one end of your guitar than the other. By performing a visual check of the neck of your instrument from both the body and the headstock, you'll stand the best chance of noticing warping.
You may want to mark any unnatural variances in the neck you see with a piece of tape. Especially for necks that have severely irregular warping, jotting down or marking where you notice the distortions in the wood will help you make more precise adjustments later., If your visual check of your guitar didn't reveal any irregularities, this does not mean that your guitar neck isn't warped, only that there is no obvious warp in your instrument. And even if you noticed warping, a straightedge check can confirm your observations or help you determine the extent of the warp. Place your guitar on a level, stable surface, like a clean workbench or table. You are going to use the strings of your guitar as your straightedge. To do this you should:


Press the sixth string of your guitar at the first and twelfth (or first and fourteenth for electric/steel guitars). There should only be a tiny gap, about 1/64th of an inch (.4 mm), between your string and fretboard on the sixth fret. No gap is an indication of unnatural back-tilt, which can be fixed by adjusting the truss rod.
Press the sixth string at the eighth and highest frets. The string should lie flat along the board along the midpoint (approximately the twelfth to fourteenth frets). A gap here indicates a rising warp in the neck of your guitar.
Press your sixth string along the first and last frets. If there is a small gap between the string sixth fret the warp in the neck is centralized in the upper part of the neck away from the body. This can usually be fixed by adjusting the truss rod. If your string and sixth fret form a gap larger than 1/64th of a inch (.4 mm), the neck is warped.
Hold the sixth string at the first fret and slowly slide down the fretboard with your other hand. As you slide down the frets, if the gap at your sixth fret decreases, the neck is warped and will need to be straightened., Now that you've performed a straightedge test with the sixth string, you'll have to repeat the test with the first string. This will ensure both sides of the fretboard are level. If your inspection has not found irregular warping, it may be your frets causing buzzing or other distortions.


To check your frets, take a straight metal ruler and lie it along the fretboard. A misaligned fret may only be out of alignment by a few thousandths of an inch. This might not be observable with your eyes, but if you lay the metal along the frets, the misaligned fret will cause the ruler to seesaw slightly back and forth., You'll want a flat and clear surface to work on while removing frets from the neck of your guitar. You're going to use the steam from your iron to loosen the glue connecting the frets to the neck, and then with your hammer and scraper, you'll be chiseling off the frets. To do this, you'll need to remove the strings from your guitar.


You may want to hold the neck of your guitar into place with a rubber ended clamp or some other suitable clamp for woodwork. This is not necessary, but can make removing the frets easier.
Make sure your iron has plenty of water. You'll need lots of steam to loosen the glue fastening your frets and guitar neck. You may want to bring some extra water in a pitcher in case you run dry mid-steaming.
It is possible that damage could occur to your guitar during this process. If you have an expensive guitar, you may be better off having a professional repair the neck of your instrument., Warm up your iron and set it to its hottest setting. Now you are ready to place the iron on the topmost segment of the fretboard to begin steam-loosening the frets. It should take about five minutes before the frets begin to loosen. At the five minute mark, or shortly before, take your scraper and begin firmly pushing it between the fretboard and the neck from the side of the neck of the guitar.


Depending on your guitar, you may need to apply more or less steam to the neck to loosen the glue. Test the bond between fret and neck every minute or so be probing it with your scraper.
The fretboard and neck will become very hot from the heat of your iron. Be careful when touching the neck or handling your guitar. To prevent being burned or scalded, you may want to wear a pair of gloves or wrap the neck of your guitar in a towel after removing your iron.
When the glue has sufficiently loosened, you should be able to get an inch or two of your scraper (or putty knife) inserted between your fret and neck. This should be enough to hold your scraper in place between the two parts unassisted., Take your hammer and gently but firmly tap your scraper on its handle until it pushes through to the other side of the neck of your guitar. When you find stubborn resistance to your hammer tapping/chiseling, you should pause and apply more steam to the frets of your guitar.


Keep your scraper at a right angle (forming an L-shape with) the neck of your guitar. This way you'll be able to tap the protruding end and the handle to wedge the fretboard free evenly. This will help prevent damage to the neck due to unequal stress being applied by your scraper.
Removing frets from the neck of your guitar can be a long an involved process. You should work slowly to prevent the wood from cracking and splintering. Damage to the neck can permanently ruin it., Work your way down the fretboard, alternately applying your iron to steam-loosen the glue and your hammer/scraper combination to separate the board from the neck. As you move down the fretboard, you should notice the fretboard come free more easily.


Even when the fretboard begins coming free more easily, work slowly and methodically. Working too fast can cause damage to the neck or fretboard of your guitar.
Once the glue has become loosened, try to wiggle your scraper back and forth in the direction of the still-glued segments. You may find this loosens the glue more easily., You'll want your cradle to be made of a hard wood, like oak. This will prevent damage to the neck while providing resistance you need to correct the warp.


Use your tape measure to find the distance between the area of the neck that is warped and the surface you are working on when the body of your guitar is laying flat. This will be the height of your cradle block.
The length of the block should be about five inches (12.7 cm), and its width an inch (2.54 cm) wider than the neck of your guitar on both sides., Now you are going to notch the cradle block along the top to make a level trough in which your guitar will nest. This will prevent your guitar from irregular forces that could cause the neck to crack, or from the instrument slipping while you are straightening the warp.


Your trough doesn't need to be too deep; a ¼ inch (6.35 mm) deep should be sufficient to hold your guitar in place. This will also help prevent stress fractures in the wood of the neck., Take your 2 by 4 and cut it down to a manageable size - 6 inches long (15.24 cm) should be sufficient. Then lay it on its wide side and make a mark in the middle of the board three inches from either side. To either side of this midpoint mark, measure 2 inches (5 cm) and make a mark in the center of the board.


The midpoint mark is where the headstock of your guitar will overhang. The marks to either side of the midpoint will be where you add tension rods, which you will use to straighten the warp of your guitar., These will be made from nails. With your hammer, pound a nail into the two spots you marked on both sides of your midpoint. The nail will need to protrude through to the other side of your 2 by 4. To shape your tension rods, you should bend the nails with pliers so the protruding nail ends point to the corresponding outside ends of your board.


Be careful you don't damage what is below your 2 by 4 when you pound the nails through the board. You'll want your nail to extend 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) out the opposite side of your 2 by 4., At one end of your work space, you should clamp your tension block firmly into place. Position your guitar so that the headstock directly overhangs the midpoint mark you've made on your tension block. When you have aligned your tension block, lift the neck and place the cradle beneath it, nesting the neck into the cradle where the warp is centralized. Then you should clamp the body of your guitar firmly to your work area at its base.


You may want to put small pieces of rubber between your clamp and guitar, guitar and work area, and clamp and work area. These small pieces of rubber will prevent damage to your guitar or work area.
At this point, your guitar should be clamped at the base to your work area, the warped part of the neck should be nested in your cradle, and your tension block should be clamped to the work area with the headstock of your guitar overhanging its midpoint., Now that your guitar is firmly held in position and supported, you need to insert the thickest guitar string you have into the A and B tuning pegs, which are the middle tuning pegs on either side of the headstock. Wrap the string around the top of the peg several times to affix it in place, then take each loose end around each pegs' closest edge and down toward the tension rods.


Place your last two rubber guards in between the string and the headstock so the string does not damage the wood, and then wind the strings tightly around the tension rods.
Your low E string should work nicely for warp repair purposes. Thicker guitar strings will allow you to apply more tension to the neck to correct the warp., By tightening or loosening your A and B tuning pegs, you'll be applying tension to the neck of your guitar. This tension is how you will correct the warped neck. But before you start applying tension with your tuning pegs, place your straightedges to form right angles ( L-shapes) with the base and the top of the neck.


Using the straightedges, you'll be more able to see if the warp has been corrected. If the top of each straightedge is aligned and level, your warp has been corrected.
You can also lay your straightedge longways down the neck of your guitar. This may make it easier for your to see lengthwise warping.
You may have to make several small adjustments before your warp is corrected. Be careful not to apply too much tension to the neck of your guitar; this could result in the neck cracking.
Once the neck is straight, you should add a half turn to each tuning peg to give the slightest backward bowing in the neck of your guitar., Lay a metal straight edge, like a steel ruler, along the now straightened neck of your guitar. This will act as a buffer between the wood and the direct heat of the iron while helping to evenly distribute the heat. A medium-low setting will help prevent you from applying too much heat too fast, which could do damage to the wood.


A constant temperature of about 350 to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (176 to 204 degrees Celsius) applied to your guitar neck for about two to three hours should help the neck hold its repaired shape. Afterward, you should allow the wood to cool for about a day., The neck of your guitar should now be repaired. All you need to do is re-glue your frets to the neck, restring your guitar, and it should play as good as new!

Trying to learn how to play different songs with an untuned guitar can confuse you. Also, many guides that you find online will be using standard tuning.


Standard tuning starting from the top string to the bottom is E, A, D, g, b, e.Play open notes on your guitar and make sure that they correspond with the digital output on the tuner.;
, When you are sitting down, there are two main ways to hold your guitar. For a casual playing style, lay the guitar over your dominant leg. On the other hand, the classical method has you set your guitar on your non-dominant leg. In both instances, make sure that the guitar is held close against your body. Holding your guitar properly makes it easier to play and prevents you from becoming fatigued. Play around with both styles and figure out which one is most comfortable for you.The classical style gives you more control over the neck of your guitar.
The casual style reduces fatigue as you play.
Make sure that the guitar is upright while you play because tilting the guitar can hurt your wrists.
When standing, make sure that you have a strap on your guitar and that the guitar is tight against your torso, with the top of the guitar over your chest.Maintain a relaxed posture as you play your guitar.

, Chords occur when you play two or more notes on different strings simultaneously to create one unified sound. These are what make up the ""rhythm"" portion of acoustic music. Single notes are used more for solos and occur when you play a single note at a time. Both are skills that you must become proficient in when learning to play the acoustic guitar., Open chords are chords that are played towards the top of your guitar's neck, near the tuning knobs. When playing the acoustic guitar, knowing the open chord shapes is critical to play popular rhythms. Figure out two easy chords, like E minor and A major, for example, to get an understanding of their shape.The 8 most common beginner open chords include C, A, G, E, D, Am, Em, and Dm.
Don't get overwhelmed by the number of different open chords, start off by learning one or two, then move onto more complex open chords.
The left string on the chord chart refers to the top string on your guitar.
Your strings are numbered from 1-6 starting from the bottom string, or the 1st string.

, The dots on the chords represent where you should hold down your fingers on the neck. For instance, an A major is played by holding down the string on the second fret on the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th string. An E minor is played by holding down the second fret on the 5th and 4th string. Hold the strings down until they are pressed against the neck of your guitar., Hold down the strings with your fingers in the appropriate shape and try to strum with your other hand. Acoustic guitar strings often have higher actions than electric guitars, so you may have to press down very hard to get a good sound. If the chord comes out muted, try holding down the strings with more force. If your string is buzzing, move your finger further away from the metal fret on your neck.On your chord chart, you'll either have an o or an x over each of your six strings. This designates which strings you should strum and which strings you should not.
For an A major, you strum all of the strings but the top string.
For an E minor, you strum all of the strings.

, Now instead of strumming on one chord, practice going back and forth between your E minor and A major. Strum four times up and down on your E minor chord before re-positioning your hand and strumming the A major chord four times, up and down.

, Once you're able to produce a good sounding chord, try strumming it at different tempos and rhythms. Rhythm is based on your strumming pattern, and how long you're holding your notes. Try a basic 1-2-3-4 beat, otherwise known as a 4/4. The number on the top represents how many beats there are in the measure. Try strumming up and down in different progressions to create a different sound for your rhythm. Once you get a basic rhythm down, you can start to incorporate quicker or slower strumming.As you play your fingers might get sore. If this is the case, take a break and come back to practicing later.

, If you don't already know how to read music, it can take a lot of time to memorize and proficiently read sheet music. Tabs are an easier and more intuitive way to write music for beginners that doesn't require any formal education. Tabs will simply tell you where to put your fingers on a fret board and how to generally play a song.While traditional sheet music can tell you the duration of the notes in a song, tabs require you to listen to the music itself.
If you're interested in playing other instruments, you should learn how to read music.

, Tabs will have six lines that represent your strings, along with numbers that designate where you should be placing your fingers. The numbers represent the fret in which you need to hold the string down. A 1 means the first fret, a 2 means the second fret, and so on. Numbers in a progression mean that you hold down the first individual fret and pick the note, then move to the next one, and so on in succession. Numbers on the same vertical line are meant to be played together simultaneously as a chord.Tabs are read from left to right.

, Listen to acoustic guitar songs that you enjoy and choose one that you'd like to learn. When finding your first song, try to find a song that has an easy chord progression. Listen to the song and determine how many chord changes it has and the speed in which the song is played. If there aren't that many chords or the song seems simple to play, you should choose that song as your first song to learn.


Easy songs to learn include “Three Little Birds” by Bob Marley, “Hey There Delilah” by the Plain White T’s, and “Upside Down” by Jack Johnson., Type in the name and artist of the song and look up the tabs in a search engine. Once you find the tabs, you'll be able to see which chords and notes that the artist is using to play the song.

, Open the song that you're covering in another window on your internet browser. Play through the song and trace the chords and notes with the tab that you looked up. Try to follow the numbers on the tab with the notes that are being played in the song. Try to get an understanding for which chords the artist is playing before trying to duplicating it.


Listen to the song 3 or 4 times.

, Once you have a basic understanding of how the notes are played throughout the song, you can start to hold each of the chords. If the song consists of chords that you're used to playing, it will make the process easier. If the song uses different chords, it may take some time and adjustment to get used to them. Practice the chords separately if they are unfamiliar to you., If the song's chords and progressions are new to you, it's easier to break the song down into separate parts. Examine the tabs and figure out parts where the chords or rhythm is repetitive. Master each of these individual parts before trying to play the entire song.If you are really familiar with the chords that the song is using, you can try playing the song all the way through over the recording of the riff.

, Once you've mastered the individual portions of the song, you're ready to play the song in its entirety. Play the song and strum your guitar along with the song. Try to keep up with the tempo of the song you're covering. Follow the tabs as you play. If you mess up, follow the music on the tabs and come back into the song when you're ready. Once you've become proficient at playing the riff, continue practicing until you don't need the tabs anymore.


If your guitar is sounding different than the track, your guitar may be out of tune, or you may be playing the wrong notes or chords.
Since tabs are sometimes user-submitted, they aren't always exact.

, Holding down a string and producing a decent sound can sometimes be more challenging than it looks. If you don't hold down a string hard enough, you'll get a muted note and if you hold down the string too close to the fret your guitar will buzz. Practice picking in an up and down motion on your string with the other hand. Continue doing this until you feel comfortable moving up or down the neck to a different note. Practice playing the notes back and forth until you become comfortable strumming.


Practice picking individual notes until you can go all the way up and down the neck of the guitar with ease.
At first, you're likely to pick the wrong string. Continue to practice until you know where the string is via muscle memory.

, One way to become proficient quickly is to learn how to transition between the various chords quickly. These transition periods are often the hardest for beginners to play when they are starting off. The more you practice between switching to different chords, however, the better you'll get at doing it in songs. Practice switching between open chords like G, A, E, and C. Take your time and be deliberate when switching from chord to chord.

, Consistent practice will allow you to improve your guitar playing skills over a short period. Taking long breaks and not staying dedicated will wear away your muscle memory and delay the development of your skills. Instead, dedicate 20 minutes to an hour of practice throughout most of the week. During practice, you can either run different drills or you can try covering a song.Once you get more comfortable with the guitar and your fingers don't hurt as much, you can make your practice sessions longer.
You will start to build callouses over your fingertips over time and will be able to play without the pain.
If you notice pain in your wrist, take a break. Try to re-position it so it doesn't hurt while you play.

, There are a variety of different tutorials online that can teach you basic or advanced techniques for the acoustic guitar. Search for lessons on popular websites like YouTube or visit websites that have guitar tutorials for free. The more informal instruction you're able to absorb, the better you'll become.


Top guitar tutorial sites include Guitar Tricks, Justin Guitar, JamPlay, and ArtistWorks., There are apps that you can download to your mobile device that will help you learn how to play the acoustic guitar. These apps range from step-to-step guides on how to play, to apps that can act as mixers and recorders. Go to the app store for your device and try to find some apps that can help you.

This is the recommended type of capo for beginners, as it is simple and easy to use.;
, Screw capos work using an adjustable knob that can be screwed to your desired amount of pressure. The downfall about screw capos is their impracticality – it's hard to do a live show when you have to keep screwing and unscrewing your capo in place. However, these capos are sometimes preferred when recording music because of the amount of control they give the guitar player., This design combines the speed of a trigger capo with the precision of a screw capo. Shubb capos use a simple lever, which can be adjusted for tension, and can easily be flipped on or off. Though they’re more expensive than the previous capos mentioned, they are very popular amongst seasoned guitar players., The G7th performance capos have become a favorite amongst many guitar players, as they are gentle, practical, and give the player great control. These capos allow for easy tension adjustment – all you need to do is squeeze it down over the desired location, and the G7th performance capo automatically locks in place. To release the capo, all you have to do is flip a lever.Some reviews claim that this capo is actually better at preserving the tone of your guitar as well.

, Set your guitar on your lap, or place it around your shoulders using your guitar strap. You should position your guitar how you would typically play it, even if you were not using a capo. Hold your capo in your fretting hand so you can easily clip it in place.








, Using a capo raises the key one half-step for every fret. If you place the capo on the first fret, the new key will be one half-step higher. If you place the capo on the second fret, the new key will be two half-steps higher. This continues with every fret.








For a specific example, let's use a standard E tuning. Say you've placed a capo on the third fret. The E strings become Gs (three half steps higher in pitch than E). All the strings become three half steps higher in pitch once the capo is applied — B becomes D; G becomes Bb; D becomes F; and A becomes C. If you're reading a tab sheet, the tab will typically tell you which fret to place your capo on.(Example: Capo 4, meaning capo on the fourth fret).

, There are a few kinds of capos that operate slightly differently, though they essentially do the same thing. All have two thick rubber paddings that clamp down on the strings of your guitar. The longer side of the capo that comes in contact with the strings is the front. The back of the capo is usually shorter and clamps down on the back of the guitar neck.







, If you place your capo on the wrong part of your guitar, it can easily become out of tune. The capo should be placed in the fret, just behind the fret bar. Do not leave a large space between the capo and the fret bar, but don't place it directly on top of the fret bar either.









If you place the capo too far back in the fret, it may cause your guitar to go sharp., Once you place a capo on your guitar, only the strings below the capo will be in the new raised key. The section below the capo is the part of the neck closer to the body of your guitar. The section above the capo is the part of the neck closer to the head and tuning pegs of the guitar. Be sure to only play below the capo once you've placed it on your guitar.








All of the chords you play below the capo will sound like they're in a higher key. Play the chords as you normally would.

, Many guitarists choose to clip their capo on the head of their guitar during a live performance so that it is easily accessible throughout their show. This allows the guitarist to easily use the capo for some songs and take it back off for others.








, All voices are different, so the original keys of some songs may not be a fit for every singer. Capos come in handy when you have to find a new key of a song for a singer. Using a capo will allow you to play the song in the new key without having to learn entirely new chords., A guitar capo can do much more than simply change the key of a song, it can create an entirely different sonic experience. For example, playing in the key of A with and without a capo will have entirely different feels even though you're playing in the same key, so experiment with your capo to hear the differences. Essentially, you'll be suing different voicing to play the same chords, which produce entirely different sounds."

Learn more precise tuning methods.,
Change the string gauge.,
Replace worn frets.,
Adjust your truss rod.,
Store your guitar safely.",How to Adjust Acoustic Guitar Intonation1," Most likely, you are tuning correctly and there is a legitimate problem with your guitar. However, it doesn't take much time to try a different tuning method. This is also an opportunity to confirm your suspicions: if the intonation is correct, plucking at the twelfth fret should produce a pitch exactly one octave above the open string. Confirm this with an electronic tuner for each string.

Some musicians reliant on digital tuners may benefit from learning to tune by ear, for situations when a tuner is not available.

If your guitar has decent intonation but rapidly goes out of tune, you may need to replace the machine heads or the bridge.
;
, Your choice of strings affects your intonation, and changing strings is one of the easiest adjustments for a layman to make. You can discover the appropriate gauge for your guitar by consulting a professional luthier or using an online guitar string calculator.

Different brands have different systems, so don't assume that every ""light"" string is the same gauge.Heavy strings may wear out your nut quickly, especially if it is made from weak materials.


, Many guitarists don't realize that replacing a seriously worn fret can make a much bigger difference than adjusting the nut.If a string has worn a groove into the fret, take it to a luthier for a new fret.
, A warped neck can cause poor intonation, but unless there's an obvious problem, you're usually better off trying the adjustments above. You may need to adjust your truss rod if your strings buzz more easily on low frets than high, or vice versa. Look for a peg above the nut and adjust with a socket wrench, or a hole near or in the sound hole and adjust with an Allen wrench. Experiment until the string has an equal tendency to buzz at all frets when tuned.Although truss rod adjustment is not as difficult as many musicians think, it is a good idea to make small adjustments at a time.

If you've never adjusted a truss rod before, ask a luthier for assistance or at least adjust slowly. Loosening will add relief (distance from string to neck), while tightening will reduce it. Extreme adjustments could damage your guitar.

You can also measure your neck arch by pressing the G string at the first and fourteenth frets, and looking closely at the distance between that string and the sixth fret. Most players will prefer a distance about the width of a medium gauge first string.


, Always keep your guitar in a humidity range between 45 and 55%, and away from sunlight and heat. A professional quality case and regular use will go a long way toward preventing the warp and wear that can mess up intonation.

Review the basics of fret and string numbering.,
Consider each of the six lines of a tab as a separate string on the guitar.,
Play the fret numbered on the tab.,
Recognize chords as multiple notes stacked on top of each other.,
Read tabs from left to right, top to bottom.,
Use a metronome or the original song to help you find the rhythm and feel of the song.",How to Play Acoustic Guitar Tab1," If you're confident finding frets and strings quickly, you can move past this step and onto reading tabs. However, it never hurts to review some guitar basics:



Fretting: The small metal strips on the guitar neck. If you're right-handed, then the first fret is the one farthest to the left. To play a fret, you push the string down just to the left of fret (right-handed). So, to play the 3rd fret you'd play just to the left of the third metal strip, so your finger is between the second and third frets.

Strings: The six strings are ordered, starting from the thinnest string on the bottom, as eBGDAE. The thinnest string is the 1st string, the thickest string (on top) is the sixth string.;
, Tablature uses six lines to tell you which string to play on. The number on the line tells you what fret to play on that string. So recognizing and memorizing these strings is essential to quickly play tabs. The top line is always your 1st string, the higher E-string. The last line is for your sixth string, the thickest string on the guitar. Some tabs label the strings, some do not:e|-------------------------------------|B|-------------------------------------|G|-------------------------------------|D|-------------------------------------|A|-------------------------------------|E|-------------------------------------|







, When you see a number other than zero, press down in before the fret of that string and play that note. So, if there is a ""2"" on the second string, you'd play the note on the second fret, second string. If you see ""0"" you don't hold any frets down. Just play the string openly. In an example:










e|-----0--2--4--2--0--2--4--2--0------|
For example, the tab above would simply cycles through three notes, the open E-string, the second fret, the fourth, and then back down.

, If there are a few numbers stacked on top of each other then you should play a chord. Play all the notes simultaneously. Fret all of those frets at once and strum the strings that are fretted. Note that any zeros are open strings, and still part of the chord.









Some tabs also tell you the chord right above the tab, putting a ""Gmaj"" or ""C7"" above the tab so that you can read it much more quickly than six simultaneous notes. The chord in the video is a C-major.

, Once you know the basics of tablature, all you have to do to play it is read from left to right. As notes come up, just follow the fretting pattern to play the song. Note, however, that this is just the order of the notes, not the speed and length they're played. This, however, can help you if you're just starting -- you can follow the tab in any tempo you like to get used to the notes, then slowly speed up.








, Unlike traditionally scored music, tabs may not show how long to play or hold a note. The best way to learn is to play the tab along to the original song, getting used to the timing and feel. Some tabs have a small tempo designation at the top, but since you don't know how long to play each fret for, this may not be very helpful.









While the distance between notes on the tab is a good guide of pauses and timing, it is just an approximation. Don't expect each space to be perfectly timed out.
Many tabs have lyrics written near the notes. While not perfect, this is a good way to get used to the timing.

Clean the guitar and inspect it.,
Find the name of the maker on the headstock.,
Try to find hidden details or a serial number if applicable.,
Make sure to inspect the back and bottom of guitar.,
Organize your findings.,
Research your findings.,
Compare it to photos of guitars you find.,
Find a guitar expert in a guitarist's natural habitat.,
Display the guitar.,
Be patient.",How to Find Out the Age and Value of a Guitar," If the guitar is dirty or dusty, take a damp (not wet) cloth or use a polish or polish treated handi-wipe (such as Murphy's Oil cloth or Fender / Gibson polish) and wipe it down, taking note as you go of the details.


Do you see inlay or detailed carvings in the wood? Is the guitar even made of wood at all? Or is it made of plasticine or particle board?






Are the tuning knobs ornate or heavy? Made of metal or bone, even? Or are they made of plastic or missing altogether?






What about the condition of the guitar? Does it appear to be old? New? In good shape? Heavy? All of these are clues telling you about the value of the guitar.






For example, if it has ornate carving or details, it is probably old or hand made, giving it more value. If it is heavy, it is probably made of a better wood. If it is in good shape, it is worth more than if it is missing parts or in need of repair.


Regardless of its shape, if it is a certain name brand of guitar, it may be of some value none-the-less.






Also, are you sure it's a guitar? Does it have 6 strings? If it has 4 (naturally, not missing 2 strings), it could be a ukulele. If it has 5, it could be a banjo. If it has 4 doubled side by side or 6 doubled side by side, it could be a mandolin or a 12 string guitar.





;
, Once the guitar is clean and you've made some observations about the condition and details of the guitar, observe the headstock and determine if you can find the name of the guitar's maker. What does it say? Gibson? Fender? Martin? All of those are reputable guitar makers.


Regardless, just because you've never heard of the maker doesn't mean it's valueless. However, the name of the maker can hold important details about when it was made, as some guitar companies are no longer in business and operated during distinct periods in history which might give you an idea of when the guitar was made.







, Look inside the sound hole of the guitar (the big hole in the center of the body of the guitar, duh!) and see if you can make out any more details. Is there a serial number or a city or year written on the paper inside of the hole? Is there any paper or details at all? There may not be.

, If it is an electric guitar, turn it over and look at the back. See if you can find a serial number or any additional details on any of the metal or parts.

, Once you've gathered your details, write them down - the guitar's maker the brand of guitar if there is one (i.e., Fender Telecaster), the size, the weight (""heavy"" or ""light"" is a good start), the type of wood if you recognize it, etc. Also make note of any damage. This might include nicks, dents, discoloration or fading on the paint, broken strings, cracks in the wood, missing tuning pegs, etc.

, Do a Google search for the guitar maker and brand. If you can find it listed on eBay multiple times and the prices are within the same range, there's a good chance that's the value of the guitar. However, if your model is a bit different - if it looks older, better, somehow snazzier, it could be worth more. Don't take eBay's word for it; go to the library, music or antique store, pawn shop or talk to a guitar expert to get a 2nd opinion. A carpenter or woodworker might also have an idea of the value. The name of someone who works with, builds and fixes guitars is a ""luthier"", so do a search in your phone book or online to see if you can find one in your community.

, You might try typing the name into Google and then clicking on ""Image"" and trying to cross reference it by the hundreds of photos that will come up.

, If all these efforts leave you info-less, try going to a local open mic and asking someone with a guitar to give it a look. Look for someone who plays well or who looks like a hippie (long hair, beard, older, faint odor of patchouli).


Most guitarists appreciate seeing other people's guitars, especially if it's something unique or of value.







, Now that it's all cleaned up and looking good, get a wall hanging guitar hook or a guitar stand and put it somewhere that it will be seen. If all your searches and hippie shake downs turned up nothing, eventually, someone will come along, pick it up and tell you everything there is to know about it.

, You might not find the information you want to right away, but when you do, you might realize that you have a treasure on your hands, or you may find the thing is just a regular old guitar.


Either way, a guitar is a great item to have around the house. Even a poor quality guitar holds value in that when a person who knows what they're doing with it picks one up, it brightens the whole room.






Music can be played on any guitar in working condition, regardless of its value. Even worthless and broken guitars make great decorations, planters, canvases, art or sculpture material, props or can be sold for parts or traded for an item of personal value to you. There's a good use for any and every guitar.

Hold the guitar flat on your lap.,
Shake it until you can see the pick through the sound hole.,
Flip the guitar so the sound hole is facing down.",How to Get a Pick out of a Guitar1," The sound hole should be facing upward. Ensure that the floor around you is free of grates, nooks, or other spots in which your pick could get lost. Also be sure that you've got clearance to move your instrument around without knocking over a nearby object.;
, Finesse is key here. Gently use the guitar’s interior support braces to help slide the pick directly under the sound hole, so it sits over the label inside. Grab a flashlight if the room's lighting isn't enough to get a good look inside.

, If you flip it over quickly enough, inertia will cause the pick to ""stick"" to the back of the guitar until the sound hole is facing down. The pick will fall in your lap."

Listen for improvements with a capo.,
Shorten the string with a shim.,
Press the string between the second and third fret.,
Check the side of the string closely.,
Raise a nut.,
Lower your nut grooves.,
Troubleshoot nut shape.",How to Adjust Acoustic Guitar Intonation2," Press a capo between the first and second fret, or just press down on a string with your thumb. If your intonation improves, it may be worth adjusting your nut (the piece at the top of the neck where the strings rest). If the different is difficult to notice, other methods will probably give faster and more noticeable results.

The nut is the most difficult part of the guitar to get right. Seek experienced assistance if any of the steps below seem beyond your ability.


, Your intonation will be off if the distance from the nut to the twelfth fret is not equal to the distance from the twelfth fret to the saddle. If that first distance is longer (causing a sharp intonation), you can fix it by shoving a piece of bone or other nut material under the string, flush against the lower edge of the nut.If the distance from the twelfth fret to the saddle is longer (causing a flat sound), you may need to re-position or replace the tailpiece. This is a less common problem, and the repair may damage the guitar finish, so don't try this unless you're sure of the diagnosis.


, If you do suspect a problem, it's time to diagnose it. Begin by releasing the capo and placing it between the second and third frets. (Again, you may use your thumb if you don't have a capo.)
, There should be a tiny gap between the string and the first fret. If you can't tell if it's touching, tap the string just below the first fret. If there's a gap, you'll hear a click when the string hits the fret.You may need a magnifying glass or reading glasses.


, If the string touched the first fret in the last step, the nut is too low. You can raise your nut at that string by gluing a piece of similar material to the bottom of the nut.Some guitarists glue a mix of superglue and bone powder or other materials into the groove instead. This is a bit risky, as it could affect the tone.


, If the gap between the string and fret was too large, you can gradually saw the groove that holds the string deeper. Work in very small increments and check visually as you go.The higher your guitar's action, the easier this is. More minor adjustments can be difficult and risks going too far.


, The nut may snag the string if the groove comes to a V-shaped point, or if the top of the string is below the top of the nut. Ideally, the nut should have a semicircular indentation, so the bottom half of the string rests atop the nut and fills the diameter of this groove. If the nut is too badly worn to correct this by hand, have the nut replaced by a professional.

Check that the saddle lies flat and even.,
Install a pre-compensated saddle.,
Reinforce the soundboard.,
Buy a guitar with non-standard frets.",How to Adjust Acoustic Guitar Intonation3," If the saddle's base is uneven, the strings may be supported at different heights, changing the intonation. You may push shims underneath the saddle to correct this, but this can make the saddle more fragile.It's much more effective to compensate the saddle, but this repairs requires wood tools and the skill of a professional luthier.

To measure this, you'll need a cheap tool called a radius gauge. Place the radius onto the 12th fret, cycling through the gauges until you find a good fit. Now place that gauge on the saddle, after tuning your guitar. The tool should touch and mute both E strings, and get close enough to the middle four strings to cause a sitar-like buzz.

You can also measure string height with a ruler with 132{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{32}}} inch marks. The bottom of the low E string should be 332{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{32}}} inches away from the 12th fret, and the high e string should be 232{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{32}}} away.


, If you want to try this yourself, you can buy a pre-compensated saddle that you think will adjust the problem strings in the correct direction. The results are usually not perfect, but the cost is lower than a professional repair, usually falling between $5 and $100 US depending on material.

You can also buy ""blanks"" and experiment in filing your own compensations into the saddle. Be sure to leave a sharp edge on the lower side of the saddle to stop all string vibration there.


, In some cases, a weak soundboard provides an unstable surface for the bridge, knocking it out of alignment. This is a diagnosis and repair best done by a professional.
, Some guitarists who want their intonation as perfect as possible claim that certain unusual fret boards improve the setup. Fanned-fret guitars are one example.

Palm mute any sections with a P.M.--------------------- over the top.,
Play completely muted notes over any ""x"" symbol.,
Recognize bends by a ""b"" or curving upward line.,
Keep track of slides by a backslash between two notes.,
Note hammer-ons and pull-offs by a slur above the tab, or an ""h"" and ""p"" between two notes.,
Add a little vibrato by shaking the note if there is a curvy line above the tab.,
Use any up and down stroke indicators to tell you how to pick or strum.,
Look up your favorite songs written tablature to practice reading quickly.",How to Play Acoustic Guitar Tab2," If you see the ""P.M."" followed by a line over the top of the tab, this tells you to palm mute. Palm muting is when you place the fleshy part of your palm just over the strings, right at the bridge (far-right, for right-handed guitarists), so that your strings sound a little chunky and muted.









You palm mute all the notes underneath the P.M. line, then stop when it ends.

, This just means to play a dead string. To do so, use your fretting hand to dampen the string, not fretting a note but not letting it sound out openly either. When you pick it, it should have a percussive, ""chick"" sound instead of a clear note.








, There are two different types of bends in tablature. Professional tabs have a curved line, like the video, telling you to go up. A full-step means you bend the notes enough it sounds two frets higher -- a half-step is one fret higher.









You might also see a b, such as ""A|------2b3------|."" This means you bend the second fret up so it sounds like the third fret.
If you see a downward arrow after the bend or a ""2br3,"" this is a ""bend and release."" Simply return to the first note, before the bend, after getting up.

, If you see a slash going from one note to the other, it means you need to slide from one note to the other. So, if you see ""D|-----3/5-----|"" it means you slide from the third fret to the fifth.









If there are parenthesis around a number, like ""(3)/5,"" it means the note is a grace note. You want to be sliding off of it right when you pick it, so you never really hear the full 3rd fret.
There might also be a line above the tab, connecting all of the notes in the slide. This is called a ""slur,"" telling you to play every note smoothly together.

, Hammer-ons and pull-offs are essential for speedy playing and are noted in two ways. First, a slur (or curved line above the numbers), tells you to play the notes smoothly together, hammering and pulling off for every note under the line. The other method is through an h and p for hammers and pull offs, respectively.









If you were to alternate two notes, it might look like: B|-----2h-4p-2h-------|


, Vibrato is simply a rapid, short bend back and forth over a note. Some professional tabs may even have thicker lines telling you how quickly to bend the note -- thicker lines mean more vibrato. It may also be noted by:









A ""v"" before or after a note.
A series of ""~"" in place of the normal hyphen between notes. Hold the vibrato as long as there are more 20:14, 15 February 2016 (GMT)~ in the tab.

, Most tabs don't use stroke indicators, which just tell you how to strum. However, there are some songs where this information is essential to get the right sound, and composers feel like they must add them. They will be above or below the actual tab. All it means is that, when you get to the note lined up with the indicator, you strum that note or chord the proper direction:









An upside-down ""U"" means you want to strum downward.
A ""V"" shape means you want to strum upwards., The best way to learn tab is to use it for songs you already know, helping you get used to the system -- not the song itself. Simply search online for ""Song You Want to Play"" + ""Guitar Tab."" Once you know tablature well, you can then use it to learn new songs. Try to practice on a classic -- like this riff from ""Sweet Home Alabama."":E|-------------------------------------------------||

Hold the guitar while standing up.,
Flip your guitar over.,
Shake your guitar with the neck angled toward the ground.,
Shift the guitar so the neck is now angled upward.",How to Get a Pick out of a Guitar2," This technique involves some up-and-down movement, so it's easiest done standing. You should have some space to move around, so be aware of your surroundings. Make sure you - and the guitar's neck - are far enough away from your 60 inch flat screen TV or mom's favorite lamp.

, The sound hole should be facing the floor. Keep a firm grip with one hand at the heel where the fretboard meets the body, and the other on the lower bout. If you're lucky, the pick might just fall out, but you'll more than likely have to do some maneuvering.

, Listen for the sound the pick makes from inside the body to track where it is. If the pick doesn't fall out of the sound hole, try to shake it to the top and center of the guitar, toward the neck. The goal is to strategically corral the pick.

, Do this in a quick motion once you’ve moved the pick to the top and center of the body. Let gravity slide the pick down the body until it falls out of the sound hole.

Find a long, narrow object and place an adhesive on one end.,
Hold the guitar on your lap.,
Insert the adhesive end of the stick tool through the sound hole.,
Lift the pick out of the hole.",How to Get a Pick out of a Guitar3," It should be long and thin enough to get through the sound hole without touching the strings.


A chopstick, small paintbrush, or pencil will work fine. Go with something you're comfortable with modifying. Don't select, for example, your favorite pen.
For the adhesive, you can use poster putty, double-sided tape, a bit of glue from a glue stick, or even chewing gum.

, The instrument should be facing up, with the strings and sound hold facing the ceiling. Position it so that you can see the pick through the sound hole. You might need to carefully shake it around until the pick comes into view.

, Touch it to the pick. Apply pressure so it sticks. Make sure you've got a grip on it before you start to pull it out of the guitar.

, Slow and steady wins the race: don't rush or you might drop the pick and have to start over. Be careful not to hit the strings or sound hole’s sides, and try not to get the sticky stuff everywhere.


With practice, you might be able to skip the adhesive altogether, and use the stick to keep the pick anchored to the base of the guitar, against the inside label, as you flip the instrument over and let gravity do the rest. "

Wash your hands before playing.,
Ease up on pressure.,
Minimize string bends.,
File your fingernails smooth.,
Don’t tighten and loosen strings excessively.",How to Extend the Life of Guitar Strings1," The natural oils on your skin can corrode the exterior of your guitar strings.You may even notice the strings losing color and developing bits of rust. To combat this, be sure to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before playing to extend the life of your strings and keep them grime-free.


Avoid applying perfumes or lotions to your hands before playing, as they are not suited for guitar strings and their ingredients may cause damage.;
, When first learning to play the guitar, it’s natural to press on the strings firmly as you gauge proper finger position. Once you have a better command of playing, though, you can actually use much less pressure to achieve your desired notes.Doing this will help minimize excessive pressure of your metal frets against the strings, which can cause physical wear to their exteriors and shorten their longevity.

, When you push a string tightly over the fret board so the pitch goes up—a technique often used in rock and blues music—it strains the string. While this effect can sound desirable, doing this excessively can damage the string’s internal structure, causing it to wear out more quickly.Nylon strings have a higher tolerance for string bends than metal strings, which tend to have more trouble snapping back into their original shape.

, If you play your guitar with your fingers rather than a pick, your nails are one of the items that most frequently touch and manipulate your strings. Uneven or jagged nails can actually cause abrasions to your strings’ exteriors, which shortens their playable life.A smooth, rounded nail shape is preferable to a square shape for guitar playing. What’s most important, though, is filing them smoothly, so no rough edges can scratch your strings.

, While some tinkering is necessary to properly tune your guitar, most amateur guitar players manipulate string tension far more than is necessary. If your guitar is in tune, try not to mess around tightening and loosening the strings just for fun.


Excessive slackening and tightening wears down the interior structure of the strings, causing their integrity to break down over time.Avoiding this will help increase string life.
Try to stick with one method of tuning to preserve your strings. That way you’re not manipulating them excessively by switching between methods—for example, between standard tuning and drop-D tuning.

Position your guitar.,
Select a rag and cleaning solution.,
Position the rag.,
Slide the folded rag along the strings.",How to Clean Guitar Strings1," Free up your hands to do work by resting your guitar on its back. You can use a table, a box, your guitar case, even your own lap. Alternatively, if your guitar has a neck strap, wear the neck strap and turn the guitar face up. Make sure the guitar's head is not touching anything to ensure that your tuning pegs don't get messed with in the process, and ideally place it on a block to stabilize it.;
, Some people prefer to use a paper towel, microfiber cloth, or dry dish towel that they fold into eighths; other people prefer to use a clean cotton diaper.Any number of cloth or paper products will work, you just want to make sure that it's clean, dry, and relatively soft. Instead of applying the cleaning solution directly to the strings, which will also result in your guitar being sprayed, spray the solution onto your rag first. This will prevent any excess cleaning solution from gathering and being difficult to remove.For a guitar with nylon strings, a non-dampened towel or one slightly dampened with water will suffice.
For guitars with steel strings, there are guitar string cleaners that are manufactured for use like Fast-Fret String Cleaner, Dunlop Ultraglide, Dr.Stringfellow, and the like. However, you do not have to use these products if you cannot afford them. 70-90% rubbing alcohol can also be effective, as can pre-shaving gel., With your rag now wet and ready to clean your strings, slide half of the sheet underneath the guitar strings near the bridge or bottommost portion for the strings. Then fold the remaining half of the cloth over so that the entire cloth covers both sides of the strings.

, You want to make sure that you go all the way from the bridge/saddle area up to the nut of your guitar. Pay special attention to the portions of string located on the fingerboard as you most assuredly touch these every time, and, if you finger pick your instrument, the portions over the soundhole. Apply downward pressure to clean the top portion, and pull upward some to be sure that you get the underside as well.


It is important to clean both sides of the strings just as it is important to clean both sides of your teeth.
Don't worry if the head gets lifted off its mount; even if the tuning pegs get a little messed up you can always retune your guitar.
You will probably notice that your guitar strings change color a little, or that the cloth comes away with grey streaks.This is a sign that your efforts are working.

Experiment with the pedal.,
Always unplug cables when you're finished playing.",How to Connect a Guitar Pedal1," Anytime you're connecting or disconnecting an effects pedal, you need to cut the power to everything in the chain. While the power cables can and should be plugged in to each separate unit, the units themselves should be switched off. Make sure the amp and each pedal are switched off when you connect them. There is one exception to this rule though - if you are using a tube or valve amp. In this case, you want to keep the amp turned on but put the amp in standby mode using the standby switch.


Trying to connect live circuits can result in shorts, as well as loud pops and feedback bursts that will come through the amp. It'll shorten the life of all the components in your rig. Don't do it.
The biggest thing to avoid is powering on a pedal, connecting it, then powering on the amplifier. This is a fast-track to a short.;
, To make sure the pedals and the amp are off before you connect them, you'll need to have them plugged in. Connect both your pedal and your amp to power and switch them on and off to make sure.


Some guitar pedals will come with 9-volt A/C adapters, while others will be battery-operated, though most feature both options. For most guitar players, batteries are nice because it's one less thing to plug in, but are a hassle because batteries die and are expensive.

, Most pedals will have only two jacks, one labeled ""Input,"" and another labeled ""Output."" These jacks are usually located on opposite sides of the pedal's body, depending on the unit, and are built to accept a standard quarter-inch (6 mm) audio cable. Locate the input and output jacks on the guitar pedal, then connect your guitar to the jack labeled ""input.""All the inputs and outputs can get confusing for the beginner. Remember: the audio signal is generated by your guitar's pickups, from where it travels to the amp through the cable. So, the guitar should always be connected to the input jack of the pedal, because this reflects the direction in which the signal travels. You play a sound on the guitar, then it travels “in” to the pedal, where it comes ""out"" and goes back “in” to the amp.

, Run another length of quarter-inch cable from your pedal to your amplifier. The cable connecting the pedal to the amp should go into the same input you would normally plug your guitar into directly.


To connect a pedal, you'll need at the very least, two quarter-inch cables. If you're chaining together pedals, you'll likely need more patch cables to fit everything together without much hassle, but if you're just plugging in one, two regular cables will work fine.

, After you've got all your cables plugged in, switch your amplifier on and set everything like you like it. In general, it's best to keep your amp relatively unaffected when you're trying out a pedal for the first time, to get a feel for how it sounds, but feel free to experiment. If you always play with the amp on the same settings, leave it how you like it.

, Especially if you're plugging in a super-fuzz distortion pedal or some kind of space-echo, you want to make sure you're not going to blow out your eardrums when you stomp on the pedal for the first time. Turn all the settings down low before you activate the pedal. You can adjust them as you play.

, To activate most pedals, you can step on a button or a lever below the control knobs on the pedal to activate it. Most of the time, a red or green light will turn on, letting you know the pedal is activated. Gently explore the features of the pedal, turning the different effect knobs up while you're playing to get a feel for the sound. Play around with different effect volumes and orientations. Have fun.


To turn most pedals off, you'll step on the button or lever again, cutting the signal to the pedal and going straight through the amp. Play around with activating and deactivating the pedal to get the kind of sound you want.

, If you leave pedals connected, the power will be drained, making this especially important if you're using batteries to power your guitar pedals. Any time you've got cables connected to the input and output jacks, the power will be drained from the pedal. If you're not actively playing, make sure all your pedals are disconnected and switched off. They'll last a lot longer.

Wipe down strings with a soft cloth after playing.,
Clean with an alcohol-based guitar formula.,
Try a string-cleaning tool.",How to Extend the Life of Guitar Strings2," Vigorous guitar playing may make you sweat, and occasionally, you may end up playing your guitar without washing your hands. Salt deteriorates metal strings and makes nylon strings dirty.To help your strings last longer, wipe them with a soft, lint-free cloth after each playing session to keep them clean.


You can buy a special flannel cloth at a music store that is specifically designed for cleaning instrument strings. To clean the strings, gently wrap one string at a time in your fingers through the cloth,and wipe down its length, rubbing as you go.
If you don’t have a string-cleaning cloth, a clean cotton T-shirt works just fine, too. Pick a portion of the shirt without any lint or screen-prints to wipe your strings down, so you don’t scratch your guitar., If your strings are very dirty or corroded, it can be helpful to deep clean them with a special, alcohol-based string-cleaning formula such as Big Bends or Ernie Ball. Many brands have products incorporated into disposable wipes and are specifically formulated not to damage the wood of your instrument.Clean your strings with the alcohol-based wipe much as you would with your soft cloth. Grip the string through the cloth between your fingers, and wipe down the length of each string one at a time, rubbing gently to remove dirt.

, Specially designed tools, such as The String Cleaner from ToneGear, can give your strings 360 degrees of cleaning. These tools sandwich all of your strings between two microfiber pads, which you sweep up and down the length of the strings.


Because it can be difficult to get large fingers under your strings, these tools can help clean the underside of your strings more thoroughly than using a cloth alone.

Store your guitar in a protective case.,
Keep your guitar face up when you aren’t playing.,
Avoid exposing your strings to excessive moisture.",How to Extend the Life of Guitar Strings3," Your guitar is made of natural materials that are prone to damage if stored at extremes of humidity or temperature. Excessive swelling and contracting of the guitar can cause you to need to retune and manipulate your strings more frequently, shortening their life.A hard guitar case will provide more string protection than a soft one. Look for a well-fitting case with a cushioned interior., Storing your guitar face up will apply less pressure on the strings and keep them from being abraded by the ground. This will help them last longer.


Never lean your guitar upright against furniture or the wall. It can fall, damaging your guitar body or strings.

, Metal guitar strings can corrode with exposure to water.Strings, like the guitar itself, are best preserved by avoiding extremes in humidity and temperature, which can cause warping.


Storing your guitar at around 75 degrees F or 24 degrees C and a humidity of 50% is ideal. A hygrometer and a thermometer can help ensure an optimal environment for your strings so they can last their longest.

Determine what your strings are made of.,
Spread some lubricant onto a rag.,
Run the rag across the strings.",How to Clean Guitar Strings2," For guitars that use nylon strings, lubricating your strings is unnecessary. Nylon strings are already corrosion resistant.If you have a guitar that has steel strings, however, you'll want to use some lubricant to keep them from getting sticky, dirty, and corroded.You can check the product packaging for the strings you have to find out what they're made of.


If you do not have the product packaging anymore, a good rule of thumb to follow is to consider the kind of guitar you have and the genres it's made to play. Acoustic and flamenco guitars that focus on classical and folk music usually possess nylon strings; electric and bass guitars associated with blues, country, and rock and pop music are more likely to have steel strings., You can use the same rag that you used to clean the grime off from before by flipping it over and using the clean side. If you feel it's too dirty and the oils from your hands have sunk into the ""clean"" side, then you can use an entirely new rag for this portion of the cleaning process. You will want to select a lubricant that doesn't contain a petroleum base when treating your guitar; these can have penetrating properties which may cause damage to your guitar over time.Dunlop Lemon Oil, Tone Finger-Ease String Lubricant, or GHS Fast Fret are all commercial oiling products you can buy that are made specifically for guitars.
If you need something cheap and readily available, you can try olive oil, baby oil, or Vaseline.You never want to apply the lubricant directly to the strings as there is a good chance you'll get excess grease on the fretboard which will be difficult to clean up.

, Position and fold the rag the same way you did when removing the grime and run the cloth or towel from the bridge and saddle area to the the nut. Apply pressure to both sides of the strings using your fingers. When done properly, the strings should end looking noticeably shinier. They should also be oily and smooth to the touch.

Clean after every session.,
Clean during sessions.,
Clean before sessions.",How to Clean Guitar Strings3," Your skin produces natural oils that combine with dust and dirt from the environment to create grime that can stick to your guitar strings.You may not even see the grime that is building up on your guitar strings, but that doesn't mean it's not there, causing extra stress to the strings, making them become dull. By cleaning your strings regularly you help slow down the process of oxidation that breaks down the material in your strings., Particularly if you're having a performance in a hot, humid, or dusty place; under lights that might make you sweat; or during an exhibition when you might be nervous and prone to sweating, it's a good idea to clean your strings during your sessions. Whenever you take a break between songs, especially to get new sheet music or a drink of water, take a moment to clean your guitar strings.

, Particularly if you let your guitar sit in an open-air stand and it's been a long time since you last played it, you may want to consider cleaning it before you use it. This will ensure that any dirt or dust that has settled from the air is removed before you begin playing, preventing the sweat and natural oils from your hands from combining with the particles.

Straighten the neck as much as possible.,
Mark the highest point of each fret with a permanent marker.,
Fit a fret leveler with an abrasive pad.,
Sand the frets smooth.,
Finish the sanding with a fine-grit abrasive.,
Reshape the rounded crown to every fret.,
Polish the frets.",How to Dress Frets," Before leveling the frets, you need to make sure you are working with a perfectly level fretboard. Use a hex key to adjust the truss rod until the neck is perfectly level. To check for straightness, you can use a notched straightedge designed specifically for leveling guitar necks; these tools have notches that fit over the frets to keep them from interfering with your measurement.
, Use a marker to shade in the highest portion of each fret; this will allow you to quickly determine if the fret has been sanded enough to remove this high point., A fret leveler is a long, metal, U-shaped tool that is ideal for sanding frets smooth; they can be purchased from guitar supply stores. The tool will need to be fitted with an abrasive surface before use. 180-grit sandpaper is the best choice for sanding frets. If your fret leveler does not have clamps for attaching sandpaper, you can affix it with double-sided tape., Run the fret leveler along the length of the fretboard in long, smooth strokes. Be sure to carefully follow the radius of the fretboard to ensure that the frets are smoothed along the profile of the fretboard. Check your progress frequently to avoid over-sanding; once the marks you made on the frets are sanded away, the frets are likely to be smoothed adequately., To smooth the tops of the frets completely, you will need to use a smaller sanding tool with a finer-grit abrasive. The best tool for this is a diamond-coated steel fret leveling block, which can be purchased from guitar supply stores. Sand the frets along the length of the fretboard as before, being careful to follow the fretboard's radius., After sanding the frets smooth, you need to restore their profiles to a round shape with a thin, flat strip along the top. To do this, use a fret crowning file on each fret. These files have a rounded profile to them that matches the fret's profile. Fit the file against the edge of each fret and sand back and forth until the fret's shape begins to round., After smoothing and rounding the frets, polish them to a shine using a polishing or finishing pad. You can clean any metal filings off the fretboard with a clean cloth."

Use patch cables.,
Always start with your tuning pedal.,
Place compressors and filter-type pedals early in the sequence.,
Put overdrive and distortion pedals second in the sequence.,
Chain modulation pedals after distortion.,
Play with the order of the pedals to get the sound you’re looking for.,
Power the cables in sequence.,
Consider investing in a pedal board.",How to Connect a Guitar Pedal2," Patch cables are short lengths of quarter-inch cable that are used specifically for connecting a sequence of pedals. It would quickly become unwieldy to patch together more than one or two pedals with 12-foot lengths of stage cable, so patch cables help to keep your set-up tidy and easy to manage.


Patch cables are also recommended to maintain signal quality. The longer an audio signal must travel, the worse it will eventually sound, so short patch cables help to keep your signal of the highest quality possible.

, When you're chaining together a sequence of pedals, the order of the pedals is very important. The first pedal in the sequence is the one connected directly to your guitar and the last pedal in the sequence will be the pedal that connects to your amplifier. Different rules apply to different pedals, but the one pedal you want to make sure is first in any chain is a tuning pedal, if you have one.Tuning pedals need clear, direct, unfiltered signals to work properly. If you installed a distortion pedal in a sequence before a tuning pedal, the tuner would be reading that degraded and distorted signal. It might sound cool, but it'll make the tuner go all wonky and give you a bad reading. Put your tuner first so your guitar will stay in tune.

, Basic rule of thumb when it comes to sequencing guitar pedals: Pedals that create tone need to go before pedals that manipulate tone. Wah-wahs, envelope filters, and other pedals that compress the natural sound of your guitar should be placed early in the signal path, following any tuners that you use.

, Some of the most common pedals used in playing rigs are the fuzz boxes. Distortion, overdrive, and other types of pedals that create great-sounding gain and distortion for controlled bursts of chaos in your sound should come after the tuners and the wah-wahs.The specific order of your distortion and overdrive pedals is up to you. When it comes to playing guitar, the rules are meant to be broken. Experiment with different orientations of your pedals to see what sound works best for you.

, Flangers, phasers, and chorus pedals work by modulating the signal and creating an atmospheric effect to that tone. It works best chained in the sequence after any distortion pedals that you might have in your chain.


Volume and reverb pedals should always be placed last in a sequence. These work best when used to adjust a finished signal, and won't work properly placed in the middle of the sequence. Reverb pedals can go out of control if placed before distortion.

, There's no ""wrong way"" to chain together pedals. For some guitar players, looking for control and reliability and quality of sound, these rules of thumb are absolutely essential to getting a ""correct"" signal. For others, you can make noise symphonies just by twisting some dials and never touching your guitar. Spend an afternoon chaining together pedals in different sequences. See what happens.


If something starts feeding back, go for the modulators and reverb units first. Anything that echoes and repeats, or loops a signal is the likely candidate for feedback, instead of distortion pedals, as you might expect. You can also turn down the effect knobs quickly to get control of the signal, if necessary.

, When you patch pedals together, you can also invest in a power-patch cable, to allow you to power all your pedals through a single 9-volt adapter, rather than trying to lug around adapters for each one of your pedals. This is usually the most efficient method for trying to power your pedals, rather than batteries or individual adapter units. It’s basically a long string of A/C jacks attached to a single cable, which you can link straight into the pedals.

, A pedal board allows you to keep your pedals organized on stage, as well as keeps your pedals ordered in a sequence that you like. If you’ve stumbled upon a set-up that works for you and produces the sound you’re looking for, it’s a lot easier to organize it on a board and keep it connected in the same basic order, rather than having to reorganize every time you want to play.

Use a digital tuner for a quick and easy option.,
Try a tuner app for convenience.,
Add a tuner to your stomp box rig.,
Snap on a headstock tuner.,
Open a browser and use an online tuner.",How to Tune a Guitar1," Digital tuners are usually small, battery powered devices with microphones able to pick up the notes of your guitar. Turn it on, then play an open E string. A light will flash when the string is tuned to the correct note. Adjust the string if necessary until the note is in tune, then repeat with the other strings.If you have an electric guitar, you can usually plug a cord directly into the tuner to check your tuning, instead of using the tuner’s microphone.;
, There are many guitar tuner apps available, and with smartphones at everyone’s fingertips, these can be a great option to keep things simple or to use when you don’t have another tuner. These apps work similarly to digital tuners, using your smartphone’s built-in microphone.Play an open E string and adjust until your app shows the note is at the correct pitch. Repeat for the other strings.

, If you use effects pedals with your electric guitar, there are models that work just like one of these. Instead of altering the guitar’s tone when you activate them, they serve as a digital tuner. Many also allow you to tune silently, which is a great option, particularly if you are playing live. Play an open string, and the tuner will light up to indicate when the pitch is correct.Many multi-effects units include built-in tuners.

, These clamp directly to your guitar’s headstock, and you can leave them in place while you play. Instead of picking up the tones with a microphone, they detect the notes by the vibrations running through the guitar’s wood. Play each string you want to tune, and the tuner will alert you when the note is correct., If you’re sitting near a computer, you can easily find a guitar tuner online by searching for one. Most tuner sites allow you to select the string you want to tune, listen to a tone of the correct pitch, and adjust the string as needed until it sounds the same.This method does not use a microphone. You’ll just have to rely on your ear to make sure the notes played on the web browser match the open guitar strings, adjusting as needed.
If you can’t access an online tuner, you can also strike a set of tuning forks or blow a slide whistle. Adjust each guitar string until it matches to pitch of the corresponding tuning fork or note on a slide whistle.

Take extra caution with vintage guitars.,
Clean the fretboard and neck.,
Clean the body of your guitar.,
Clean your bridge as you would the fretboard.,
Wipe down the tuning keys.,
Polish your pickups.,
Polish your finish.",How to Clean a Guitar," Cleaning a guitar requires only a few materials. A soft cloth, like an old t-shirt or a sock, will do the job well, along with some water, glass cleaner, and a guitar polish that contains pure carnauba wax. An electric guitar can be cleaned in the same way as an acoustic.If you want to do a heavy duty cleaning on your guitar, you can use white distilled vinegar -- this is a safe product that won't damage the finish on your guitar. You should avoid most household cleaning products that contain silicone, heavy waxes, lacquer thinner, and bleach. All purpose cleaners and furniture polishes are also products you should avoid as they can damage the finish on your guitar.
Avoid using paper towels to clean your guitar as they can scratch the guitar's finish, especially if it is a lacquer or shellac French polish. Using a cloth that has been laundered many times will work best because it should be mostly free of lint.;
, Before your begin the process of cleaning your guitar, it's a good idea to remove the strings so that cleaning your fretboard becomes an easier task. When you change your strings, that may be a good time to clean your guitar. Make sure you only remove a few strings at a time so that you don't mess with the neck tension on your guitar.It's important that you remove your strings on your guitar, because as you are cleaning the rest of the guitar you don't want any cleaning products to come into contact with your strings. Your strings should be free of any oils, polishes, or damp cloths that you may use while cleaning.

, It can be tempting to display your guitar or to leave it out on its stand when you aren't using it, but the best way to protect your guitar and keep it clean is to put it back in its case.


If you feel like you need to leave your guitar on its stand so you will remember to play it, make sure the room it is in has about 50 percent humidity. Little humidity can dry the wood out on your guitar, causing the fretboard to shrink and flex.If your guitar does show signs of drying out, you can purchase a guitar humidifier and place it in the body of the guitar. Exposing a guitar to humidity can help restore its original look.

, Vintage guitars with a nitro finish will change color or develop a sheen or patina over time as part of the normal aging process. You want to avoid using polishes on these guitars as they can remove these finishes. Clean your vintage guitars simply with a cloth and a little bit of water.

, This is the part of your guitar where the strings are. A fretboard, or fingerboard, should only be cleaned once or twice a year, so that the natural oils and moisture on your guitar that are picked up through the contact with your fingers remain on the guitar. Using your cloth, lightly dampen it with water or distilled vinegar, and gently wipe away the dirt or grime you find on your fretboard.When cleaning your guitar, make sure you wring out your damp cloth as much as possible -- you don't want to oversaturate your guitar with water or cleaning products.
For those really dirty spots on your fretboard, you can use a piece of extra fine #000 or #0000 steel wool to scrub them out. Because steel wool can get caught to the magnets of your pickups, you might want to cover up your pickups if you choose to use steel wool.

, Moving down the length of your guitar, clean the body of your guitar -- the front, back, and sides -- with the same damp cloth. Make sure you rinse out the cloth so that you don't just spread the dirt to other areas of your guitar. Move the cloth in circular motions across the body of your guitar.As you clean your guitar you may notice some spots that don't come off just by wiping them with the cloth. Fingerprints, smudges, or dirtier spots may need a little bit of moisture, so ""huff"" warm breath on your guitar, just as you would if you were cleaning a window. Then, wipe with the damp cloth. If this still isn't enough you can use a small amount of mild detergent with water. After you have cleaned these spots, buff with a dry cloth to remove streaks.

, The bridge is located on the body of the guitar, below the sound hole, and it supports the strings of your guitar. To clean the bridge of your guitar, use the same method as the fretboard, dampening a cloth and wiping down the bridge to remove dust, dirt, and grime. For the difficult spots, you can use a toothbrush or pipe cleaner to gently scrub away the dirt., These are the keys at the top of your guitar neck, on the headstock of your guitar. To clean these keys you can spray a dry cloth with glass cleaner and polish each key to bring back the shine., These are usually located on an electric guitar, on the body of the guitar in place of the sound hole. If your pickups look a little dirty you can clean them up with a damp cloth, but if you spot rust on your pick ups, carefully remove them from your guitar. Once you have unscrewed your pickups (using an Allen wrench is an easy way to do this), clean them with a rust-dissolving agent.


You can also remove rust spots using a white pencil eraser or a cotton ball with a small amount of lighter fluid.
Once you have cleaned your pickups, screw them back onto your guitar and wipe dry with a clean cloth.

, Some guitar experts suggest not to polish your guitar frequently, as the polish can build up and while it looks nice cosmetically, it may dampen the sound of your guitar. If you are going to polish your guitar, use a polish that contains pure carnauba wax and no solvents or petroleum products. Spray your polish on a cloth and gently wipe down your guitar.If your guitar has a satin finish, do not polish or buff it. Buffing a satin finish will cause it to look blotchy.
You should also avoid polishing vintage guitars. Follow the above directions for how to protect your vintage guitars.

Practice listening to two notes at the same pitch.,
Tune the sixth through third strings.,
Finish by tuning the second and first strings.,
Memorize the pattern for checking tuning by identical pitches.",How to Tune a Guitar2," Unlike a piano or many other instruments which can play each pitch only one way, a guitar can play multiple notes of the same pitch. This means that you can tune a guitar by matching these notes together. Practice playing and listening to two notes of the same pitch together, like the fifth fret on the fourth string and the open third string.When the notes are tuned correctly, they will sound identical.
If the notes are not tuned to the exact same pitch, you will hear a wavering sound called “beating.”
To tune, adjust one of the strings up or down until this beating slows and then disappears.

, Start by assuming that your sixth string (the low E) is in tune. Play the note at the fifth fret on the sixth string, and the fifth string open. Listen to see if the notes sound the same. If not, adjust the fifth string until it matches the note played at the fifth fret on the sixth string.Repeat this pattern by playing the fifth string at the fifth fret with the open fourth string, then the fourth string at the fifth fret with the open third string. Adjust the strings as necessary.
Strings 6-3 will then be tuned to each other.

, The pattern varies when tuning the second string. Play the third string at the fourth fret and the open second string. Adjust the second string as necessary until the note is correct. Then play the second string at the fifth fret together with the second string and tune in the same way., Think of “55545” as an easy way to remember the notes you should fret and pair with the next string (open) in order to tune your guitar. Once you learn how to tune in this way, you can start with either the low E string and go up, or the high E string and go down."
"
Practice playing harmonics.,
Tune the sixth through third strings with harmonics.,
Play a harmonic on the sixth string above the seventh fret.,
Tune the first string with harmonics.",How to Tune a Guitar3," The same pitches can be produced by harmonics on different strings, allowing you to tune the guitar to itself. The benefit of this technique is that the harmonics will ring out by themselves once you play them. Your playing hand will be free to adjust strings as necessary while still hearing the tone.Guitar harmonics are high-pitched notes produced by lightly touching strings (not depressing them to the fret) at various places.
Tuning by harmonics is also a relatively quiet method.

, Assume that the sixth string is in tune. Play the harmonic on the sixth string above the fifth fret and another harmonic on the fifth string above the seventh fret. Listen to see if the pitches are the same. Adjust the fifth string if they are not.Repeat this pattern by playing a harmonic on the fifth string above the fifth fret together with one on the fourth string above the seventh fret.
Then play a harmonic on the fourth string above the fifth fret, and another on the third string at the seventh fret.
Adjust the fourth and third strings if needed.

, Then play the second string open. The pitches should be the same if the guitar is tuned. If they are not the same, then adjust the second string up or down until they match., Play the harmonic on the second string above the fifth fret, and another on the first string at the seventh fret. Adjust the first string if necessary until the pitches are the same.

Alternatively, you can play a harmonic on the fifth string at the seventh fret (or on the sixth string above the fifth fret), and the first string open. Choose whichever method is most comfortable to you."

Remember standard tuning with a silly acronym.,
Adjust the pitch of strings by turning the tuning pegs.,
Double-check your guitar after tuning all the strings.,
Get your guitar to concert pitch if you are playing with other people.",How to Tune a Guitar4," In standard guitar tuning, the strings are tuned EADGBE. Each letter corresponds to a string, from the low sixth to the high first. It’s easy to remember this order with a fun acronym, like:Every Angry Dog Gets Bit Eventually
Evenings After Dinner Gertrude Baked Eggplant

, Follow each string to its corresponding tuning peg. In most cases, turning the pegs counterclockwise will raise the pitch of the string. Do this if it is lower than the desired note (flat). Turn a peg clockwise to lower a string if the pitch is too high (sharp).You only need to turn the tuning pegs a little at a time. This will make it easier to find the precise pitches you need.

, Once you’ve tuned your guitar by any method, play some notes and chords to make sure everything sounds right. Sometimes notes are off because the guitar moved slightly as pressure changed from adjusting strings, or simply because a tuner or your ear wasn’t 100% accurate. If this is the case, just check the strings again and readjust any that are off., Tuning a guitar to itself is just fine for solo play and practice. Though the notes relative to each other will sound in tune, it means the whole guitar might be a little sharp or flat relative to other instruments. To be in tune with other people, you’ll want to be in “concert pitch,” or tuned to the precise notes EADGBE.Use a digital tuner, tuning forks, or a slide whistle to find the precise pitches you need.

Improvise over the song to get a feel for the correct key and feel.,
Determine which scale you want to use.,
Start writing with big, simple whole notes.,
Incorporate other melodies from the song if you are lost.,
Think of a solo as a brief story, building tension throughout.,
Keep improvising until you find something you like.",How to Write a Guitar Solo1," In order to write a solo, you need to be comfortable with the song and the chord changes. For any solo you're writing, you'll likely be in contact with the person who wrote the song, and they should tell you the key and the chords they used. If not, the key is usually the first chord played. Listen to the song 2-3 times while fooling around on your guitar to get some early ideas for scales, licks, and tones.


Don't worry about coming up with the perfect solo on the spot. Just play along, making a mental note of parts that sound good.;
, There are a lot of options out there for scales, and none of them are necessarily ""right."" While you can play multiple scales in one solo depending on the chords being played, beginners should get comfortable with one scale first, then move on to more complicated solos. If you don't know any of the following scales, click here to learn more about guitar scales and modes and expand your soloing range. When starting out, there are two basic scales that can be applied anywhere on the neck, for use in almost any song. The following shapes can be moved anywhere on the neck to change the key:


The Minor Pentatonic Scale is one of the most versatile scales around, used in rock, blues, pop, and some jazz music. For a song in E minor, you would play:
E|---------------------0-3-|
B|-----------------0-3-----|
G|-------------0-2---------|
D|---------0-2-------------|
A|-----0-2-----------------|
E|-0-3---------------------|
The Major Pentatonic Scale is similarly versatile, but has a happier, jauntier feel. For a song in E minor, you would play:
E|---------------------3-5-|
B|-----------------3-5-----|
G|-------------2-4---------|
D|---------2-5-------------|
A|-----2-5-----------------|
E|-3-5---------------------|The Major Pentatonic Scale is a happier, brighter version of the above scale, and can be used in similarly bright songs. For a song in E Major:
e|-------------------------------------9--12--|
B|------------------------------9--12---------|
G|-----------------------9--11----------------|
D|----------------9--11-----------------------|
A|---------9--11------------------------------|
E|--9--12-------------------------------------|

, Instead of playing as fast as you can, play one practice solo where you just play 8-10 notes total. Make these big, powerful notes -- the ""islands"" you can return to once you start playing quickly. These notes, which most people naturally place on or after chord changes, will form the road map for your solo.


Try a solo where you just play the root note of whatever chord is being played. This will help you find the structure of the song on the fretboard., If you don't know your way around a scale, can't think of anything to play, or simply want to give your solo some structure, try playing the same notes the singer used. Start off with a 4-5 note lick that resembles the main melody or a lick you play earlier in the song. Then play it again, this time changing 1-2 notes. Adjust this lick 2-3 more times, ending with something completely different from your original lick, to write a great, simple solo that fits in seamlessly with the rest of the song., The best solos ever written, from Clapton's searing blues in ""Layla"" to the single-note genius of Django Reinhardt, all have structure. They build slowly, adding complexity over time to hook the listener -- not just show off technical prowess. The best way to start is to think of your solo as having a beginning, middle, and end. A good structure to start with might be:



Beginning: start slow, with short little phrases of multiple notes, or slower repeated bits. You want to introduce the notes you'll be playing, maybe playing off an earlier melody, repeating the same phrase 2-3 times, or mimicking the vocal melody.

Middle: start exploring the fretboard as the chords start changing. You might move into higher notes, play some repeating notes, or start incorporating bends and vibrato.

End: end the solo on your best phrase or your fastest set of notes, culminating the solo in a high point or climax., Sometimes you'll find the solo instantly, but more often than not you'll need to play it several times, taking what you love and cutting what sounds bad, until you have a full solo worth playing. Stay loose and try new things. Once you have your notes down you can start spicing up the solo with added flourish and fun:


If you have some key notes that hold for a long period of time, try shaking or bending them to make them really sing.
Can you slide into notes? Hammer on or pull-off them for quicker playing?
Can you cut or add notes to make the pacing and tension build up better? Are there some odd notes outside of the scale that give the song a unique flavor?"
"
Practice your scales regularly, playing with new patterns.,
Choose your notes wisely, like a singer chooses what notes to sing.,
Study the solos of your favorite guitarists by learning them perfectly.,
Sing or hum your solo ideas, then figure them out on the guitar for quick, melodic solos.,
Pick up new techniques to add flair to your solos.,
Learn how to use modes to your advantage.",How to Write a Guitar Solo2," Play the scale up and down. Don't try to play it fast-- You will improve much more quickly by playing it very slowly for 20 minutes than by trying to play it as fast as you can for hours. Make sure you play it cleanly without any dead notes or screw ups and listen to each note in correlation to the others. When you're sure you have the whole scale down:


Play new patterns. Run three notes down the scale, back up two, down three, etc. Skip every 4th note. Play notes 1-2-3, then 2-3-4, then 3-4-5, etc. in rapid succession. These little tricks will speed your hands up and keep you from always playing simply up and down.

, If you replaced all the words in a song with notes, you'd basically see that good singers are ""soloing"" all the time. However, since singers must move more slowly than a guitarist, they are more concerned with making each note count. They can't simply run through a scale -- they have to make the whole line or verse coherent, intertwined, and smooth. You should be doing the same thing in a good guitar solo, no matter what speed you go. While composing, think about:


What are the important notes, and how can you emphasize them with vibrato or bends?
How do you get from one note or chord to another smoothly and melodically?
What is the overall feel of the song? How does your solo fit into that feel?, Solos aren't just a random assortment of notes in a scale, but rather they are composed of a quick, precise, and melodic succession of scalar intervals. Try listening to some solos, singing them back and working them out on the guitar and see how they work play the chords underneath.


The best guitarists in the world all spent years memorizing other people's solos, taking little licks and learning structure firsthand. Duane Allman, for example, famously operated his record player with his toe, moving the needle to rehear solos over and over while he tried to learn them on the guitar.There are guides and videos online to ""Learn to play like _____."" These are great ways to learn new scales and note combinations for your own solos.

, If you have a specific vision in mind, sing it out and record the ""solo"" in your phone or computer. Then grab your guitar and work on transcribing the song onto the fretboard., You can learn guitar techniques like sustained bends, pinched harmonics, vibrato, sweeping palm muting, etc. to give a unique sound to your lead playing. Not every solo needs an advanced technique, but having a bigger bag of tricks will lead to better, more diverse solos every time.

, Modes are variations on common scales, each with distinctive notes and flavors. Learning modes is a great way to tailor your songs to the genre or mood of the song you're soloing over, and they don't vary wildly from the pentatonic scale. However, the modes change depending on your key. Because there is too much variation to list here, the best way to choose a mode is by knowing music theory, or searching online for modes in the key of your song. There are many online generators that let you type in the key and the mode you want, then show you the scale you need.



Ionian - The basic major scale sound, it is often considered ""happy"" or ""triumphant.""

Dorian - Your all-in-one blues, rock, and metal scale, common for minor keys.

Phrygian - The exotic mode. Sounds a bit middle-eastern/Egyptian.

Lydian - Common in Steve Vai songs, this creates a dreamy atmosphere.

Mixolydian - Old school blues/jazz based, and common with acoustics.

Aeolian - Straight minor, often considered ""sad"" or ""depressing. Used in classical music a lot.

Locrian - Super ""evil"" and dark sounding, and common in heavy metal."

Using scissors, cut off the old guitar strings.,
Open the pack of new strings.,
Apply and tighten one string at a time.,
Start with the lowest string (the low E string).,
Loop the short end of the string around the long end, and wind the short end of the string around the loop that you formed.,Turn the tuning peg at the head of the guitar so that the hole for the string is facing upwards.,Pass the string through the hole, loop the string around the peg back to the front of the guitar, and pass the string through the hole again.,
Turn on the guitar tuner, turn the peg and tighten the string until you are about 5 notes below your target note.,
Once all the strings are on, wait 1 to 2 hours.,Allow the strings to sit overnight.,
After about 24 hours, tighten the strings to their correct note.",How to Change Nylon Strings on a Classical Guitar," Avoid scratching the guitar with the scissors.
, Do not remove the string label until you are ready to put the string on the guitar. The strings look similar, so keeping the tag on avoids potential confusion., Repeat the following process for each string., Thread the string into the bridge at the bottom of the guitar, allowing about 4 inches to pass through to the other side.,

For the copper-plated strings (low E, A, and D), you only need to wind the short end of the string once or twice, but for the clear nylon strings (G, B, and high E), it's recommended that you wind the string around the loop at least three times.

,,, Move on to the next string., Then tighten the strings one at a time to about 3 notes below your target note.,, You are now able to play on the guitar!"

Familiarize yourself with the basics of tablature.,
Learn to play individual notes using tablature.,
Play a chord.,
Account for the length of notes.,
Manipulate individual notes.,
Write key signatures.,
Attach additional information.",How to Write Guitar Tablature," Pieces written using tablature are operationally based, meaning that music is notated with reference to the physical location of the note on the fretboard. Pieces are transcribed with 1 bar for each string on a given instrument (e.g. a piece for a six string instrument has six lines.) The highest bar denotes the bottom string (the thinnest and highest sounding one), and the lowest being the top string (the thickest and lowest sounding one). Columns denote measures, sort of like a traditional music bar.


Each bar will have numbers and a letter at the beginning.;
, The numbers represent notes and the letter tells the tuning of a particular string. So when you see a 1 on a string line, that means you play that string while pressing the first fret. If you see a 0, that simply means play the string without pressing a fret.

, You may run across numbers on multiple string lines all on top of each other. This means you will play each string while pressing each indicated fret at the same time, making a chord.

, The space between notes judges the length of each one. The closer the space, the faster the next note is. In some cases, tablature will have letters at the top of the table with a letter indicating the note length as in standard notation. For example, an ""e"" is an eighth note and a q is a quarter note.

, If you see an X on a string, that indicates a muted note (not pressing a fret, but placing a hand or finger lightly on the string to where it is just a sort of clicking sound).


If there is a ""p"" or an ""h"" in between notes, that indicates a pull-off or a hammer-on, respectively. A pull off is when you press 2 frets on the same string and remove the finger from the higher one to change the note to the lower one. A hammer-on is the opposite; playing a fret and then pressing a higher one on the same string, changing the note.
If there is a ""\"" or a ""/"" between notes, that means to slide from the first note to the next one. The direction of the slash indicates if it is a slide up or down the neck.
A ""b"" after a note means to bend the string on that note, changing the pitch.
You also may see ""s"" ""p"" or ""t"" at the top of the tab, this means to slap, pop, or tap the note directly below it.

, When writing tab for an actual song, set a standard key signature (e.g., 4/4, 3/4, etc.) and a tempo, like in traditional music notation.

, Some tabs incorporate additional notation into a piece, which must be explained with an accompanying key.

Practice scales to work on your technique and speed.,
Use alternate picking.,
For more rhythmic variety, experiment with triplets.,
Use scales like harmonic minor, melodic minor, diminished etc.",How to Write a Metal Riff," This will make the sound that makes heavy metal sound heavy. If your guitar is in standard tuning (EBGDAE) play an Em with palm muting. Just play the first three strings (EAD). Example: The bridge on Raining Blood by Slayer.;
, Without them this will be useless. They give another heavy sound in the song. Power chords on the low E string sound great. Most metal songs use power chords, so it's basic. A great simple power chord progression is: Milk by Anthrax.

, It will sound great, awesome and heavy. Example: Harvester of Sorrow by Metallica.

, This will be more complicated but after you're in the right position you'll make it. Example: Master of Puppets by Metallica, Washington is Next! by Megadeth.

, The rhythm is the important thing, not the heaviness. In the 80's The Big Four didn't downtune their guitars. But, it makes playing easier. Some good downtunings are Open G, Drop D & Drop C. The Drop C gives a kinda mystical tone. Bands that use a lot of downtunings are System Of A Down (Drop C), Disturbed (Drop C, Drop D and others), Rise Against (Drop D) & Dream Theater's John Petrucci uses a different tuning for each song.

, You'll need these techniques: Sweep Picking, Bends, Vibratos, Tremolo Picking, Tapping, Slides, Hammer Ons, Pull-Offs, Thrills, String Skipping and if you want a little Zakk Wylde use some Pinch Harmonics. To get the hang of the soloing learn solos by Metallica (Master of Puppets album), Megadeth (Countdown to Extinction album), Slayer(Reign In Blood album), Anthrax & Dream Theater.

, You have to use scales, and working on them makes you a better all-around player. Just go up and down the scale slowly at first, then try to incorporate scales into your playing.

, Just pick up and down.

, They sound cool, they're fast and help your alternate picking. Try muting the triplets. Example: Disposable Heroes by Metallica.

, Heavy metal doesn't have any rules. If you want to make your songs heavy and dark use the above said scales. Harmonic minor gives a middle eastern feel, but you don't have to stick to a one scale. For a melodic sound use the minor scale.

Sit with your back straight and your feet apart.,
Rest your guitar on your right leg.,
Position your left hand over the guitar's fretboard.",How to Use Good Guitar Posture1," Proper guitar posture begins with sitting straight. Your back should be straight up to prevent fatigue, and your feet should be resting on the floor about a foot (30 cm) apart from each other. The ideal chair height should leave your thighs roughly parallel to the floor.;
, To begin positioning the guitar, rest the waist of the guitar on your right thigh. Keep the guitar balanced by resting your right forearm over the guitar's lower bout.


The ""waist"" of a guitar is the narrowest part of the body. On either side of the guitar's waist are the upper and lower bouts - the protruding curves of the body.







, Your left hand should be able to comfortable curl underneath the fretboard, with each of your fingers able to access the strings. If you develop a pain in your wrist, you should angle the fretboard higher so that your wrist does not have to bend as far.


Do not use your fretting hand to support the fretboard. If you remove your left hand from the guitar neck, it should remain in position without dipping towards the ground.







"
"
Attach a strap to your guitar.,
Stand straight and place the guitar over your head.,
Adjust the height of the guitar.",How to Use Good Guitar Posture2," A guitar strap, usually made of leather or vinyl, is necessary to support your guitar in a standing position. Push your guitar's 2 strap buttons through the holes located at either end of the strap. You can adjust the length of the strap after wearing the guitar.

, The guitar strap should fit naturally over your left shoulder, running down your back and to the guitar's lower strap button. Rest your hands in their playing position and determine if the height of the guitar strap is comfortable for you.

, If your guitar is hanging too low, you will have to bend your wrists at awkward angles to play. This can make playing fast passages more difficult and lead to injury. Remove the guitar and shorten the strap until you can reach the fretboard and strings comfortably.

Find a chromatic tuner.,
Start with your low E. It doesn't matter if your E is out of tune because you're going to change it anyway.,
Tune your A string.,
Detune your D string.,

Tune the B string.,
Tune the high E string.,
Recheck each string.",How to Tune Your Guitar a Half Step Down1," It is not necessary to go out and spend $60+ on a chromatic tuning pedal. If you have a smartphone, there are plenty of applications that cost anywhere from $0 to $3. Invest in a chromatic tuning pedal if you plan to perform live a fair amount., Tune your low E string down until the screen reads Eb or D#.

, Tune down your A string until the screen either reads Ab or G#. Don’t tune too fast or else you could pass Ab and become lost.

, Tune your D string down until the screen of the tuner says Db or C#. Use a relaxed pace when tuning down your string.

, Tune your G string down until the tuner says Gb or F#.

, Lower the B string’s note until the tuner says Bb or A#.

, Detune the E string at slow pace until the screen reads Eb or D#.

, Usually after detuning all your strings your guitar will not hold the new tuning at first. Go through each string and make sure they are all in tune to EbAbDbGbBbEb or D#G#C#F#A#D#.You might need to check the tune of each string a few times.
Test the tuning by playing a chord. Pluck each string in the chord and make sure each string sounds in tune.

Check the tuning of your guitar.,
Start on the A string.,
Fix the low E string.,
Finish tuning the rest of the strings.,
Double check your tuning.",How to Tune Your Guitar a Half Step Down2," Make sure that you are in standard tuning. You'll tune down a half step to whatever you are currently tuned to if not., Play the 4th fret on the low ""E"" string. This is an Ab. Tune the ""A"" string down until it sounds the same as the ""E"" on the 4th fret. The ""A"" is now an ""Ab"".

, Play the 7th fret on the A string. This note is an Eb. Play the E string open and the A string on the seventh fret. Tune up the low E until the sound matches the A string on the seventh fret.

, After tuning the low E and A strings, tune like you would normally. Follow this order:


Tune the 4th string to the 5th fret of the 5th string.
Tune the 3rd string to the 5th fret of the 4th string.
Tune the 2nd string to the 4th fret of the 3rd string.
Tune the 1st string to the 5th fret of the 2nd string.

, If you have the means, use an app or website that has a tuner and check your tuning. Tuning your guitar down a half step changes your guitar neck's tension. It'll need time to settle before holding a new tuning. "

Place the capo on the first fret.,
Find a tuner or a piano.,
Tune the rest of the guitar normally.,
Remove the capo.,
Adjust the tuning.",How to Tune Your Guitar a Half Step Down3," Capo's are easy tools that help shift between different keys. They're usually used to play in a different key or voice, without changing the tuning. When the capo is on the first fret the low E will instead be an ""F.""


You'll tune the guitar into standard tuning, which is a half step lower than the first fret. Then when you remove the capo, you'll be tuned a half step lower.

, Tune the first string down to an E. If you are using a piano, play an E note and match the low E string to that note. Take it slow and make sure the notes are synchronized.This can be a good technique if your tuner is not chromatic. Chromatic tuners hit all the notes including sharps and flats.

, Go through each string either using a tuner, piano, or your ear. Play a standard E chord and check to see if everything sounds tuned.

, After adjusting your tuning, you should now be tuned down a half step. Play an E chord after you've removed the capo., Go through each string within a chord, and make sure it sounds in tune. Rely on your ears, but you might need to use a tool.

Use some wire cutters to snip off excess string, leaving only about 1/8 of an inch (1/2 centimeter) of ""stub"".",How to Change Guitar Strings," There is much debate about whether it is wise to remove and replace every string individually, or simply to unstring everything and then restring it all at once. The choice is yours as to which method to use.


Using the one-at-a-time method, you maintain most of the tension the neck is used to and therefore keep string tension in balance with truss rod tension.
Removing all the strings at once permits you to clean and wipe the fingerboard without lifting up the strings or having to work around them. Fingerboards accumulate a mix of skin oil, skin and dirt (which saps tone and acoustic sustain from the guitar).;
, Loosen the strings until they are no longer under tension. Then, either clip them using nippers or continue to loosen them via the tuning machines until they can be pulled out of the tuning pegs.









An inexpensive tool called a peg winder, available at any music/guitar shop, is very handy for this.

, These are the knob-looking things (usually white or black) that allow the strings to hook themselves onto the inside of the guitar. Use a bridge pin puller, which comes in a wide range of varieties and are sold at any music/guitar shop. Bridge pins can be quite stubborn, especially if either they or the guitar is new. Occasionally you may be tempted to grab these from the outside with pliers. While this is acceptable if done with the utmost caution, it is generally not necessary.









Another method would be to push the pins out from inside the guitar, using a hard object such as a coin. Pushing the string further into the guitar as you do this sometimes helps since the end of the string is wound and ""wedges"" itself in with the peg. Once the pegs pop free you can pull them out of the peg holes.

,, This comprises cleaning the body, fingerboard, back of the neck, and headstock. Use a decent cleaner from a guitar or music shop if possible. Never use furniture polish, glass spray or other common household cleaners. If nothing else, simply use a slightly dampened chamois cloth or lint-free cotton cloth. Oils from your hands will build up on the fingerboard of the guitar with remarkable speed causing a thick gunk.









If you must use water, you should apply such a minuscule amount of water to the cloth that you can barely tell it is damp. Excess water can ruin unsealed wood.

, Some strings' ball ends are color-coded to indicate what note they are to be tuned to.

, There are many theories about what order strings should be applied. Some guitarists start at the thin end and work their way up, or start at the thick end and work their way down.


The most preferred method is to first put in the thinnest string, then the thickest, then alternate to the next-thinnest, then the next-thickest and so on (1, 6, 2, 5, 3, 4). Alternating in this fashion keeps a more even left-to-right pull on the neck of the guitar and makes later tuning less problematic, especially for older guitars.

, You should be holding in the string during this time. It is helpful to pull a little tension on the string toward the head of the guitar because this tension is what keeps those pegs from falling out.

, Once each string is in its peg hole, stretch it up to its appropriate tuning peg and insert the end through the hole in the peg. Keep in mind that you will want to be turning the guitar tuning key ALWAYS TO THE RIGHT to tighten. If the tuning keys on your guitar are on opposite sides of the head (as is usual), you bring the string up between the two rows of key pegs and to the outside.








, You will want to leave just a little bit of slack to have some excess string to wind around the tuning pegs. If you do not, you will run out of string too quickly and the strings will loosen up when you are playing.


This is, regrettably, a trial-and-error process and is different for each string. Just remember, you can always cut off more if you leave too much. You can never add back what you cut off.

, This can take a good deal of winding (again, the peg winder is very handy for this part). Make sure that when you tighten the string that each subsequent wind stacks one below the last, so that none of the winds overlap. This ensures both a cleaner looking wind and a longer life to the string itself, as well the guitar itself staying in tune.









Do not tighten the string to its usual pitch, but rather a few semi-tones below. You want it tight enough to hold in place and put enough tension on the bottom peg to not come out again, but now is not yet the time for ""tuning"".

,,, Cutting the string too short can make the ""stub"" end slip back into the spooled string and loosen your strings.









This applies only to classical nylon strings which wind this way. Ignore this for steel string guitar.

Make or buy a set of 78 cards - one card for each note on the guitar up to and including the 12th fret.,
Test yourself with the first 6 cards – the cards for the open strings of the guitar (E,A,D,G,B and E), played without pressing on any frets.,
Look at the cards for frets 1 – 4.,
Take the cards that cover frets 5 – 8.,
Take the cards that cover frets 9 – 12.,
Shuffle the pack of cards, and then test yourself with a few cards every day, taking a few cards from the shuffled pack.",How to Use the Philip Glaser Flash Card System,"

Using any guitar book that shows all the notes on the fretboard, fret by fret, you can copy that chart and make the set of 78 flash cards yourself. Put a picture of one note on one side of a card and on the other side of the card put the name of the note, and a diagram showing the location of that note on the guitar.
Buy a set of the 78 guitar flash cards called ""Philips Learn All the Notes on the Guitar Flash Cards."" Search online to find out where you can buy the set.;
,

Say aloud the name of the note, and then say where that note is on the guitar fretboard.
Look at the other side of the card to see if your answer is correct.
If your answer is correct, play that note on the guitar.
When you can test yourself with the 6 cards for the open strings without making mistakes, do the next step.

, There are 24 cards.

Test yourself with these 24 cards – a few cards each day, the same way you tested yourself with the first 6 cards.
When you no longer make mistakes with these cards, do the next step.

When you no longer make mistakes with the cards for frets 5 –8, do the next step.

,

Test yourself with these cards – a few cards a day, in the same way as before.
When you no longer make mistakes with the cards for frets 9 – 12, do the next step.

You are relied upon to keep the band cohesive, bridging the percussion and melody instruments. Always practice strumming with a metronome to ensure you're rock-solid and reliable in the rhythm section.






;
, The power chord is the beginner's bread and butter. They only require two fingers and are easily slid around the entire neck, making it possible to play a basic version of many songs the minute you learn the form.









Power chords only use two or three strings, meaning they still sound fresh under distortion and effects.
Power chords are powerful, rocking chords that sound at home in rock, punk, pop, blues and many other distorted genres.

, There's a perfectly good reason for this, but it is buried in music theory and not crucial to a basic understanding. The part that matters is that power chords aren't major or minor, they are ""indifferent."" This means they can fit under any type of music, in any genre.









For example, you could use a C power chord (or a C5, in music theory) to back up either a C major or a C minor song.

, The most basic are called ""dyads,"" where you play only two notes to imply the cord, like a C or A#m. If the word ""dyad"" bothers or confuses you, just think of these as the standard power chord.








, Your fingers will be a string apart, and two frets away. So, if you're on the 6th string, 4th fret with your index finger, your ring finger will be on the 5th string, 6th fret.









To make the chord louder and ""thicker,"" hold your ring finger down so it covers the 4th string as well.

, If you want to play these starting on the fifth string instead, do the same thing but put the first finger on the 5th string and the ring finger on the fourth string two frets up.









Again, you can hold down your ring finger to make a harder, three-finger chord.

, Despite the fancy name, know that it's just playing 2 strings on the same fret. This gives a more ""deathly"" sound that is useful from time to time, although some think the standard power chords with or without octave are a lot clearer and more effective in general. A less common but nonetheless useful power chord is something some like to call the ""straight 5th.""









Here's a two string G power chord shown in tab:

--X--
--X--
--X--
--(5)--
--5--
--3--


Here's a C:

--X--
--X--
--(5)--
--5--
--3--
--X--



, An octave is another version of the same note, in this case, your root. The octave is two strings down, two frets down from the note on your index finger. Simply hold your ring finger down on the string just below it, so you're fretting two strings at once. You can also use your pinky. This is a fuller sounding cord, with a brighter, bigger tone. It is a little slower to play, however, if you're playing faster music.









Here's the G with the octave added:

--X--
--X--
--X--
--5--
--5--
--3--


And here's the C with the octave added:

--X--
--X--
--5--
--5--
--3--
--X--



, Now that you have the form down, you can play power chords anywhere. You don't even need to change your form or finger positioning.








, Just for fun, play around with straight 5ths using the D and G strings open. Stay on the 3rd fret and 5th fret, moving them around until a song starts to form.









If Smoke on the Water doesn't happen within 30 seconds, add the 6th fret on the E string to finish the song.

Use barre chords to play minors, majors, sevenths, and much more anywhere on the neck.,

To make a minor chord, move the whole form down one string, ignoring the top string.,
Play a seventh barre chord by simply removing your pinky finger from a major barre chord.,
Drop the 7th down a string or remove your ring finger to make a minor 7th.,
Drop the bottom strings if you're having trouble nailing barre chords at first.",How to Understand Rhythm Guitar Basics2," Barre chords are adaptable, slide across the neck, and come in set forms that you can learn relatively quickly. They take some stretching to get used to, however.









Barre chords, like power chords, get their name based on your index finger's position. If it is on a G, the chord is a G.
Barre chords come in ""forms,"" meaning that once you learn how to set one up, you can move it anywhere across the neck to go from Gm7 to Am7, or a B major to a C major.

, Your index finger on the top string determines the chord, just like with power chords. When done, place the ring finger on the fifth string two frets down, where the green dot is.








, Place the little (4th) finger just below it, on the fourth string (still two frets up from the bar). Put the middle finger on the 3rd string 1 fret up from the bar. This form can now be moved anywhere across the top string to form a major chord. A G major bar chord looks like this in tab:









--3--
--3--
--4--
--5--
--5--
--3--
To make the chord minor, simply remove your middle finger (the 4th fret) and leave it barred.

, All your fingers go one string below where they were for the major barre chord. Don't play the 6th string. The top note (root) is now on the 5th string. Now, wherever your index finger is on the 5th string becomes the chord -- if it is on a C, the chord is a C minor. The rest of the E-chord shape stays the same, so a C major might look like this:









--3--
--4--
--5--
--5--
--3--
--X--

, Seventh chords, whether open or barred, are the blues chords. They are melodic, but still a little sad. Whenever you want this old-school, bluesy feel, you want major seventh chords.

, Just like moving from a major to a minor chord, you can move from a major 7th (A7) to a minor 7th (Am7) by either lifting your finger on the third string or by dropping the whole form down a string. Remember that if you drop the form, the new chord is based on your root note or index finger placement. So a Cm7 could look like:









--3--
--4--
--3--
--5--
--3--
--X--Or

--8--
--8--
--9--
--8--
--10--

, Purists will tell you to play these major chords on 5 strings, to get the high E string in there. This is great if you can be bothered with the more difficult fingering involved, but if not, you can 'cheat' and dump the high E, making the hand position a great deal easier to pull off. To do this, just bar the middle 4 strings (A, D, G, and B) with the first finger, and then bar the D, G, and B strings with the ring finger two frets up.









Here's how a C major chord looks in tab (X = don't play this string):

These chords strike a nice balance between the indifferent-sounding power chords and the big old 6 string bar monsters.
They won't turn into mud even under a good bit of gain, but they still sound like 'real chords.' They are nice for those rhythm parts where you roll back the guitar's volume knob a bit and provide backing for the vocalist or another guitarist.

Tune your top string down to D to get Drop-D tuning, allowing a deeper sound and easier power-chords.,
Use a Drop-C tuning for a heavy, killer sound.,
Make sure the rest of the band knows you're using a drop tuning.",How to Understand Rhythm Guitar Basics3," Some guitarists tune their E string down to D so that they can play power chords. This is seen by many as cheating, but deliberately 'mistuning' strings (scordatura) for any reason is a centuries old method used for any stringed instrument and has been used by Van Halen, Led Zeppelin, and many other bands that were known for their guitar work.









Since the D is now a full half-step lower, you can play simple 2-finger power chords with ease-- just hold the 6th and 5th string on the same fret.
This ""drop D"" tuning also allows for a deeper, darker sound, which many metal and alternative guitarists now prefer.

, For drop-C tuning, not only do you tune the lowest string way down to C, but all other strings down one note also. Metalcore bands such as Atreyu, Killswitch Engage, As I Lay Dying, Fall of Troy, and others use this tuning as it is deep and heavy. The final outcome (from thickest to thinnest) is:









CGCFAD
A similar metal tuning, known as ""Dethklok,"" is C F Bb Eb G C which is simply two whole steps (4 frets) down from standard tuning. The intervals are the same, so your playing never has to change, but everything is much, much deeper.

, Your whole band will be out of tune if you're not on the same page. The third fret on the top string, for example, is not a G if you're in Drop-D -- it is a half step lower -- a C#.








"
"
Use the minor tuning to play big, 6-string minor chords easily.,
Tune the G (3rd) string down to F, the B (2nd) string down to A, and the E (1st) string down to D. Use an electronic tuner, or search online for a video or clip of someone playing the tuning, if you tune by ear.








,
Bar across all 6 strings with the index finger, and bar the last five strings with the third finger, two frets up.,
Simplify to 4-string chords to get even faster, chunkier chords.,
Add the 5th string back in with your index finger for an extra bass note.",How to Understand Rhythm Guitar Basics4," The hand position to hold a six string minor chord is identical to the 'power chord' form, but all 6 strings are held down. This makes minor chords fast, simple, and easy to find.








,,









Here is how a G minor chord would look in tab:

--5--
--5--
--5--
--5--
--5--
--3--



, You can play some very nice 4-string major chords with a hand position that is simpler than the multi-finger bar chord used in standard tuning. Just bar across the first 4 strings with the index finger, then place the middle finger on the 3rd (F) string one fret up.









Here's how a G major chord would look in tab:

--5--
--5--
--6--
--5--
--X--
--X--



, You can also add a bass note to these major chords by playing the 5th string without altering the feel of the chord too much.









Another advantage of playing major chords this way is that the ring and 4th fingers are free to add some nice runs to your chord work.
Major chords with these sorts of easily available runs embellishing them aren't heard too often in rock music, so this is an opportunity to break new ground to some extent.
The beauty of this tuning is that the low E, A, and D strings remain unchanged, so you can still do power chord work on the bass strings.
The tuning is especially nice for those metal songs that begin with a lot of clean minor chords and then go into the distorted fifths.

Place your palm lightly on the strings to dampen them.,
Plunk the edge of your palm down close to the bridge, as far back down the strings as you can get.,
Use the bridge pickups for the best palm muted sound if playing electric guitar.,
Practice inserting this technique between some power chords.",How to Understand Rhythm Guitar Basics5," That low, chunky, plodding chord sound in many songs is done by palm muting. To do so, you place the meaty part of the right hand on the strings somewhat close to the guitar's bridge, holding it just on the strings so you can still hear them, but they still sound slightly dead.








, Keeping your palm lightly on the strings, pluck the low E string a few times. It should have a dull, chunky sort of sound. If you're right handed, your fingers go as far down the right of the guitar as possible.








, It's a good idea to use the bridge pickup on your electric guitar with this technique, providing more chunk.









Choose the neck pickup for a grinding, long, deadly buzzy sound for palm muting.
When possible, use a guitar with humbucker pickups for palm muting. Make sure your gain and volume are up so you can fill the song with a thick, rhythmic chunk.

, Getting your palm onto the guitar without missing a beat is a key skill for rhythm guitarists. You should be able to flip back and forth between the two -- going from strong, killer chords to a palm-muted bridge in an instant. The contrast between the two is a great rhythmic trick for any guitarist.









Learn to start palm muting, then slowly raising your palm off. Work on acting as a human volume knob, seamlessly transitioning.

Fret a note, play it, and slide to another fret without picking up your fingers.,
Keep your finger pressing down hard against the string for the entire slide.,
Slide into notes for a smooth start to a solo.,
Aim for slides on your 3rd and flat 5th notes for extra bluesy playing.,
Know that you can slide across multiple strings.",How to Use Sliding for Blues Guitar," A slide is supposed to be a continuous sound. You pick the note, holding down your finger, then slide up or down the neck while you can still hear the first note. You should hear the pitch of the note move with your finger -- getting higher if you move towards your body and lower if you move away.









A slide is noted on a tab by a slash. Slides down are forward slashes (/) and slides up are backslashes (\). For example, a slide from the 3rd fret to the 5th, and then back, is noted by ""3/5\3."";
, Make sure you use your fingertips to fret, as they are more precise and harder than your fleshy finger pads. You need to hold the note down hard, but still lightly enough that you can slide down the string.









Start slow -- slide from one fret to the other, focus on keeping the note playing the whole time.
Newer strings are always easier to slide on than older ones. Fresh strings are almost always worth it.

, If you see a tab with a / before a fret, with no number before the slash, this means you just slide into the note from anywhere. In the above lick, you can slide into the third note for a classy, smooth entrance to the solo.








, Slides to the 3rd note or the flat 5th note are often the most bluesy places you can start moving. By ""3rd note,"" this means the 3rd note in your pentatonic scale. The flat 5th is the blues note located between the 3rd and 4th notes in the pentatonic scale. The notes are bolded below, in the key of A.









e|---------------------5-8-9--------------|
B|--------------------5-8-----------------
G|----------------5-7-8-------------------|
D|---------5-7----------------------------|
A|-----5-6-7-----------------------------|
E|-5-8------------------------------------|

, You can slide power chords, single notes, or even double note sets. Try, for example, sliding the 3rd fret on the bottom two strings (the thinnest ones), down to the 4th fret and back up. This little slide fits nicely in the key of E-blues, and you should get used to little slides down here for bluesy accent notes.

Put your guitar on standard tuning.,
Know your notes.,
Start the tuning.,
Tune the Bass E, the thickest string you have.,
Tune down the E string by listening to the C bass.,
Proceed to the A tuning, down to G. A is two chords higher than G (this means, G to G# then A) so it won't be as much of a problem as E going to C. Since the E is already in C, it's way down low.,
Go to the D string going down C again.,
Tune the G string, number three string (by counting from small e) or the number 4 if you count it from the big E. However, the G string is as is.,
Tune the B string.,
Finish up.",How to Tune a Guitar to CGCGCD," If you want to tune your guitar, do it in a quiet place to make sure. Tune your guitar by ear to make sure that you know how to turn it up with the right vibrations.;
, The standard tuning of a guitar is E-A-D-G-B-e. Since you are striving to get the C-G-C-G-C-d tune, first you'll need to know what your strings sound like.


E=C, A=G, D=C,  G is still equal to G, B=C, e=d

, The tuning requires to be sharped and flatted, theoretically speaking.

, Tune it down to C. Of course, you know how to play the guitar, so make a C chord now. The C bass, which is actually the A string or the second thickest, is on the third fret (as you can see when you've done the C regular chord).

, Get down as carefully as possible to get the C. The string may loosen but that's actually it and it's totally fine. Keep on going but make sure that you're still on the right track. It should sound thicker than the C bass in the A string. Just make sure that it sounds the same.

,


Hit the seventh fret on your guitar with your newly tuned string (the E to C string) and it makes a G note.
From there, tune the A string (the second thickest/bass) to the G on the seventh fret. Tune it down carefully again, don't miss your note and there you have it. Compare how it sounds by hearing the two string carefully, feel the vibrations and the tone.

, Hit the fifth fret on the G string (the one you've tuned earlier from A to G), and that makes a C again. Tune your D string down again, don't miss the C and tune accurately.

, So, don't worry about it. Let it be!

, This is going up C. From the previous strings, you went down but here you go up, (tuning going up is easier than going down). Since the D string is already C, then just make it as the same as the B string, you just need to slightly go up, it's just a one step note. Don't miss it!

, Now you are on the Little E going down to D. So hit the third fret on the C string (the string from B to C) and you get a D. Tune down again, do it carefully and you're done!

Pull the mouthpiece with your hand.,
Tap at the mouthpipe with a wooden mallet.,
Tie a loop of rope around the mouthpiece.",How to Remove a Stuck Mouthpiece from a Brass Instrument1," If the mouthpiece is stuck, you can try to grip it with your hand and give it a little counter-clockwise twist. If it is not stuck too much, you will be able to pull it out with your hand.;
, Use a wooden mallet and give several little, fairly light taps around the mouthpipe (the insertion point where the mouthpiece goes in). This might help to loosen the connection between the mouthpiece and the instrument., Hold the instrument in one hand and hold the ends of the rope in your other hand. Give the rope a yank to see if the mouthpiece will come out.You can also wrap something around the rope, such as a mallet or other object, that will give you more leverage in pulling on the rope to remove the mouthpiece.
If the mouthpiece pops out, it might go flying across the room and hit the floor, putting it at risk for further damage.

Place your instrument over a sink.,
Tie some ice cubes to the instrument with a wide rubber band.,
Start running very hot water over the mouthpipe.,
Turn off the water and pull out the mouthpiece.,
Dry your instrument and store it.,
Inspect the mouthpiece for damage.,
Use a mouthpiece trueing tool.",How to Remove a Stuck Mouthpiece from a Brass Instrument2," You will need access to very hot running water. Have a towel ready as well, in case the water starts to drip over the instrument too much as you’re working.

, Using a wide rubber band, such as the kind that holds broccoli together, position ice cubes around the mouthpiece. They should touch the insertion point where the mouthpiece goes into the instrument. Let the ice cubes sit against your instrument for a few minutes to get the metal really cold.

, Run the water as close to the mouthpiece insertion point as you can get without melting the ice. As the hot water hits the mouthpipe, it will start to expand the metal slightly, while the cooling effect from the ice cubes will contract the mouthpiece metal. Keep the hot water running for a few minutes.


Don't get the hot water on the lacquered (brass colored) part of the lead pipe. This will cause the lacquer to tarnish or even come off altogether.

, Take the instrument out of the sink. Wrap the rubber band around the mouthpiece as tightly as possible. Grab the mouthpiece firmly, using the rubber band as a sort of grip, and pull the mouthpiece out.

, Dry off your instrument carefully with a soft cloth. After making sure there is no moisture on the outside of your instrument, store it carefully in its case.

, The mouthpiece end that inserts into your instrument should be round and clean. There should be no rust or other debris on it. Look for dents and an oval or squashed shape by holding the mouthpiece at eye level or comparing it to an undamaged mouthpiece.

, If your mouthpiece is misshapen at all, use a trueing tool to return it to its correct shape. This tool looks like a skinny T and has a somewhat pointed end. To use, insert the tool into the end of your mouthpiece. Tap it very gently with a rubber mallet (not a hammer!). The tool will force the mouthpiece end to become rounded."

Use a mouthpiece trueing tool.",How to Remove a Stuck Mouthpiece from a Brass Instrument3," Pliers are the one of the worst tools to bring into contact with your instrument. They can scratch and bend your mouthpiece, and using them might even start to break apart your instrument at the mouthpipe., A mouthpiece puller is a handy device that is solely intended to pull stuck mouthpieces out of brass instruments. They can be used for small and large instruments, so they are versatile enough to use on trumpets, trombones, tubas and so on. These are available online or in music stores.The most common mouthpiece pullers are:


Bobcat Mouthpiece Puller: This is the least expensive, costing about $40. This one has two screws that need to be tightened simultaneously when using it.
Ferree G88 Mouthpiece Puller: This is a more expensive option, costing about $100. It is bulkier, but it only has one T handle that needs to be screwed in when being used.
DEG Magnum Mouthpiece Puller: This is usually the most expensive puller, costing about $130. It is very similar to the Ferree.

, You should have a level working space. Be careful to not put it near the edge where it can fall. Alternately, you can do this on the floor, especially if you have a large instrument.


You may want someone to help you by gently holding the instrument still while you operate the mouthpiece puller.

, One end of the mouthpiece puller will go against the instrument at the point where you insert the mouthpiece. There are usually grooves or other U-shaped areas where your mouthpiece will fit into the puller.


Read the manufacturer’s instructions to ensure you are using the mouthpiece puller correctly.

, Depending on the type of puller you are using, tighten the screws (on the Bobcat mouthpiece puller) or the T handle (on the Ferree G88 mouthpiece puller). Turn the screws evenly, steadily and slowly. The mouthpiece should start to move out of the instrument.

, Once the mouthpiece puller has loosened the mouthpiece, you should be able to gently twist and pull to get it free. It should come out smoothly.


For mouthpieces that are really stuck, use a rubber mallet to tap the puller when it is tightened up. This might enable you to turn the screws a little more to help move the mouthpiece., The mouthpiece end that inserts into your instrument should be round and clean. There should be no rust or other debris on it. Look for dents and an oval or squashed shape by holding the mouthpiece at eye level or comparing it to an undamaged mouthpiece.

, If your mouthpiece is misshapen at all, use a trueing tool to return it to its correct shape. This tool looks like a skinny T and has a somewhat pointed end.

They will likely have a mouthpiece puller that can be used.Your band director can also inspect your mouthpiece to make sure its shape is correct.

, Someone who has been playing brass instruments for a long time will likely have more experience with removing stuck mouthpieces. Ask them for assistance in implementing the best techniques for removing your mouthpiece if it gets stuck.

, Most music repair shops will use a mouthpiece puller or other mechanism to remove a mouthpiece. Often they will not charge for this service, since it’s a simple procedure and can be completed quickly. Call before you go to make sure they can pull out your mouthpiece for you.

It should not turn more than about a half of a rotation, if that. Never bang in the mouthpiece.Over time, the twisting will have a threading effect and make the mouthpiece less likely to be stuck.

, Always remove the mouthpiece before putting the instrument in its case. Place the instrument in the case properly. Do not put extra items like music or other items in the case where they don’t fit.

, Keeping your mouthpiece clean will help ensure that it fits properly and smoothly into your instrument. Wash it carefully with warm water and mild soap, drying it afterwards with a soft cloth. Periodically, apply a little dab of valve or key oil to the insertion end., Dropping a mouthpiece on a hard surface such as tile or concrete is sure to dent or otherwise damage your mouthpiece. Even dropping a mouthpiece on carpet can risk damaging it. If you drop the mouthpiece, inspect it right away to ensure that it is still round.

Listen to the blues, particularly the singers, to get accustomed to blues phrasing.,
Use silence to your advantage, creating tension and drama.,
Mimic the classic blues phrasing of ""Call and Response"" within your solos and riffs.,
Use repeated themes, with slight variations, to tell a story with the music.,
Throw in a little ""dovetail phrasing"" for sultry, emotional licks in and out of solos.,
Use bends, slides, and vibrato for expressive blues phrasing.",How to Use Phrasing for Blues Guitar," The best way to learn the blues is to listen to them. Pay particular attention to the singers, who need to create complex emotions and tones with only a few notes. How do they hold back, create silence, and/or rush notes to give the song it's feel and power? Do the instrumentalists, particularly guitarists, do anything similar?









Muddy Waters, Ma Rainy, Lightening Hopkins, and modern blues players like Gary Clark Jr. are all great places to start listening.
The blues began with just guitar and vocals, with singers like Robert Johnson and Blind Willie. Tapping into this relationship is essential.;
, Well-placed silences are the reason guitarists like Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix are so famous for their speed. They know that the blues is a constant up and down -- an emotional rollercoaster that mimics actually feeling the blues. Good blues phrasing opens up space with silence, then fills it with a blistering run of notes or a soulful, slow bend. But it is the well-timed silence beforehand, not the notes themselves, that show a master of blues phrasing.









When you're first starting out, think of silence as a way to create suspense. Get the audience on the edge of their seat, waiting for your next note.
Almost as good as a silence is a long, powerful note or bend held a long time to build suspense and tension.

, The call and response is one of the oldest blues forms, and can be found in many songs. It is when words or a melody are used, then immediately repeated, often with a subtle change or different pitch to make things interesting. The point is to start a conversation between two instruments, singers, or sections of the song.









Listen to the king of the blues, B.B, in songs like ""How Blue Can You Get."" Note how he sings, and the guitar ""answers"" the call.
Call and answer works best with another instrument -- the guitar and piano, for example, copying and playing off of each other.

, A theme is simply 3-5 notes (or more) repeated throughout the song. It often mimics the melody of the singer, or another memorable line from the song. Returning to this theme, often adding a new note or changing the tempo or rhythm, is a good way to make a solo feel cohesive but still surprising.









Keep a few bars or measures in between your phrases, letting them disappear before they come back.

, This gives you the sort of pleading, crying sound essential for blues guitar. A dovetailing note starts out strong, then weakens and fades into silence gracefully. Remember that silence is a key part of good blues phrasing -- getting in and out of it is essential too.








, The blues is all about emotion and expression, and the physicality of the guitar is the best way to show it. Bend, shake, manipulate, and slide along the strings to add excitement and personality to your playing. While it is hard to teach, letting yourself relax and get into your playing is really the key to great, personal blues playing.









Bends: Use your fingers to push the strings around, bending into new notes and holding everyone's attention with soulful string pulling.

Vibrato: Shake a note back and forth, using all the fingers you can get behind the fret to really move it. This is a subtle, bluesy way to add emphasis to a note.

Slides: Gets you around the neck in the most bluesy way. Spend some time find where you can slide to and still sound good.

Wipe the brass with a soft, damp cloth.Run a soft rag under lukewarm water.,
Buff gently with a dry cloth.,
Assess the brass.",How to Polish Brass1," Wring out the excess, then wipe the brass with the damp cloth using small circular motions.


Lacquer is a protective coating, and for lacquered pieces, most mild to moderate dullness can be buffed out with physical means rather than chemical ones. In fact, if you use a household cleaner or other type of polish, you risk ruining the lacquer coating.
Use a soft cotton or terrycloth rag for best results.;
, If the lacquered brass still appears somewhat dull, take a dry cloth and buff the surface for several minutes, working across the entire surface in small, circular motions.


For this part of the process, you could consider using either cotton cloth or jewellers' cloth. Jewellers' cloth has an outer layer of soft flannelet and an inner layer of flannel with bits of hematite embedded into it. This hematite acts as a fine abrasive.
Note that if you do use jewellers' cloth, you should buff with the abrasive side first and follow up by buffing with the non-abrasive side to remove and residue left behind by the hematite.

, At this point, the brass should appear fairly polished. If it still looks tarnished and dull, however, you may need to strip the lacquer completely and clean the brass more thoroughly.

"
"
Choose the right polish.,
Apply the polish to a dry cloth.,
Buff the brass.,
Rinse and dry to remove residual polish.",How to Polish Brass2," Many commercial metal polishes can be too abrasive for some brass items. As a general rule, look for a polish specifically labeled to work for brass. One labeled for use on the particular brass item you intend to polish is an even better choice.


Use a wadding-type polish when possible.Other types of commercial polish can be too rough since they are formulated to clean automotive metals or stainless steel.
Avoid products that contain tarnish inhibitors since they tend to leave a film on the surface of the brass.
Also avoid products containing ammonia since ammonia can dissolve the copper component of brass.
Common brands include Brasso, Bar Keepers Friend, Never Dull, Cameo, Hagerty and Blitz., Squeeze a dollop of the brass polish onto a soft cloth. A little can go a long way, so you do not need to use much.


Use a soft cotton or terrycloth rag for best results.
It is recommended that you apply the polish to the cloth instead of applying it directly to the surface of the brass. Applying the polish to the brass can make it more difficult to spread the polish evenly, and as a result, one portion of the brass might get a higher concentration of polish than the rest of the surface.

, Wipe the brass down with the polish-coated cloth, applying even pressure in small, circular motions. Cover the entire surface in this manner.


Follow the label instructions on the polish when applying it, even if they differ from those described here. Most polishes work in the same way, but different formulas can have slightly different requirements, and using a polish improperly can result in damage to your brass.

, For some polishes, you may need to wipe the polish off with a damp cloth before buffing gently with a clean, dry cloth.


Some polishes do not need to be rinsed off. Even for these polishes, though, you should still buff the surface with a dry cloth.

Combine distilled white vinegar and flour.,
Add a little salt.,
Arrange your brass items on a platter.,
Apply the paste and let it sit.,
Wash off the dried paste.,
Buff with a dry cloth.",How to Polish Brass3," Mix 2/3 cup (160 ml) of distilled white vinegar with 2/3 cup (160 ml) flour. Stir the ingredients together in a plastic or glass bowl until smooth and thoroughly combined.Never use a metal dish to combine the ingredients. If possible, you should also use a plastic or wooden utensil to mix the ingredients over a metal one.
Vinegar is acidic, and this acidic quality can dissolve debris responsible for tarnishing and dulling brass. The flour makes the polish slightly more abrasive, but the main benefit of flour is that it thickens the vinegar and creates a paste.

, Mix 1/2 cup (125 ml) salt into the paste until well combined.


The salt adds an abrasive component to the paste. It works, both chemically and physically, to make the paste more effective.
Note that this paste will not store well, so you should only make as much as you need at the present moment.

, You'll need to let the polish paste sit on the brass for a prolonged period of time, so you should arrange the brass items in need of polishing on a plastic or glass platter and in a single layer.


If you decide to use a metal baking sheet, line it with a layer of parchment paper or wax paper first to avoid letting the brass and the paste come into direct contact with the metal sheet.

, Use a spoon or your fingers to apply the paste in a thick, even coat onto all sides of the brass surface. Allow the paste to sit on the brass for at least 1 to 2 hours, if not longer.


For severely tarnished or dulled brass, you can even leave the paste on overnight.
As the vinegar paste does its thing, you should see it take on a green tint. This green tint is a natural result produced by the chemical action taking place, and it means that the tarnish and surface debris being dissolved and removed.

, When the brass is ready, gently scrub the paste off with a soft cloth and lukewarm running water. Gently buff the surface of the brass using small circular motions as you rinse.


Use a soft cotton or terrycloth rag for best results.
Scrub the surface of the brass thoroughly to make sure that all the paste has been removed. Depending on how thick your paste ended up being, it could take a bit of scraping with your thumbnail to chip it away.

, To dry the brass and give it a final boost of shine, buff it with a soft, dry cloth using small circular passes until you cover the entire surface.

Squirt a dollop of ketchup onto a soft cloth.,
Rub the surface of the brass with the ketchup.,
Wipe off the residue.,
Buff until dry and shiny.",How to Polish Brass4," A lot can go a long way, so you only need about 1 to 2 tsp (5 to10 ml) of ketchup, at most.


Use a soft cotton or terrycloth rag for best results.
Tomato juice is a mild acid, so the use of tomato-based products can help dissolve debris causing tarnish and dullness on your brass.
Ketchup is your best option since it is so thick, but in the absence of ketchup, you could also try tomato paste or tomato juice.

, Wipe the sides of the brass object down with the ketchup-covered cloth, coating all sides in the ketchup.


For best results, rub the ketchup on in a single direction instead of rubbing it on in a back-and-forth motion or a circular motion.

, Use a damp cloth to wipe off the ketchup after allowing the tomato substance to sit on the surface for a couple of minutes.


You could also rinse the brass under running water to get the ketchup off, but using a damp cloth provides the added benefit of a little extra buffing.

, Use a dry, soft cloth to dry off any remaining moisture while giving the brass a final shine. Thoroughly buff the entire surface by passing over it in small, circular motions.

Combine acidic lemon juice with a mild abrasive.,
Apply the lemon juice to the brass.,
Rinse off the residue.,
Dry and buff with a soft cloth.",How to Polish Brass5," The most common abrasives including baking soda and cream of tartar. Alternatively, you could also use half of a lemon and a little salt.


Combine 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) of lemon juice with 1 to 2 tsp (5 to 10 ml) of baking soda. The mixture should fizz at first, but gradually calm down once you stir it together.Mix 1 Tbsp (15 ml) lemon juice with 2 Tbsp (30 ml) cream of tartar, combining the two together to form an evenly thick paste.
If using lemon and salt, cut a lemon in half and remove the seeds from one half. Coat the cut surface with table salt until well-coated.

, Use a soft cloth or your fingers to wipe the lemon paste onto the surface of the brass, coating it completely. Rub the paste on in a single direction for best results.


Use a soft cotton or terrycloth rag for best results.
A lemon-and-baking-soda paste only needs to sit for a few minutes, but a lemon-and-cream-of-tartar paste should sit on the brass for about 30 minutes.
If going the lemon-and-salt route, rub the salt-covered lemon half over the entire surface of the brass. Apply more salt to the lemon as needed until the entire brass surface has been polished.

, Place the brass under lukewarm running water and gently wipe the residue away with your fingers.


If parts of the brass still seem dull, you can reapply the lemon solution of choice to that area for additional shine.

, Wipe the brass dry with a soft, clean towel. Apply even pressure in small, circular passes to give the brass an extra buffing.

Start with a rental if you are on a lower budget or not sure about your dedication to the instrument.Lease a baritone if you want to own it eventually. A payment is typically made every two to three months until the instrument is paid off. The instrument will not be yours until the final payment is made, but you will have the baritone while you are making payments.;
, Different models are made for different experience levels. A student level baritone is typically cheaper, more durable, and more simply made than a professional level baritone.


Try contacting a music dealer to fit you with a baritone that feels comfortable for you.
If you must purchase the instrument online, try to communicate with the seller about your level of experience.

, A baritone is easily damaged. It is important to protect your baritone when you are not using it. A good case will have strong handles, sturdy backpack straps, and most importantly, it will provide a snug fit.A leather case is most often used by musicians because it is light and durable.

, Make sure the valves are facing up. Pick up your mouthpiece and carefully insert it into the mouthpiece hole.Avoid inserting the mouthpiece with too much force. Inserting it too hard will cause a jam.

, The instrument may feel heavy at first, so spend some time getting used to the weight. Support the instrument with your left arm. Place your right hand on the valves., Sit with your back up against the chair. Place your feet flat and parallel to each other on the ground.

, Work towards a consistent pitch. Don’t be discouraged if it sounds uneven at first. Right now you are just working on getting your instrument to make noise., Focus on the sound being produced. The baritone makes a very low and rich sound. The speed of your lips determines the pitch as well., Not knowing the scales is normal and expected for a beginner. Don’t worry if you’re not sure what note you’re playing yet. Work on getting familiar with the valves and then learn the scales.

, Gently remove the mouthpiece and put it in the mouthpiece hole in the case. Return the instrument to its case. The case should be stored with the bell in an upright position. An incorrectly stored case with the bell turned upside down will weaken and damage the instrument over time.Check and clean the spit valve regularly after a practice session.
Store the case in a place with a cool or moderate temperature., You will need to learn the names and locations of the parts on your baritone. Pull up a picture, or use your instrument to identify the parts. The main parts are: The bell. The bell is the large, rounded opening where the sound waves emerge from your instrument. Sometimes the bell is straight, and sometimes it is bent forward. The bell is designed to produce the best tone and volume possible.The three valves. The valves are comprised of three parts: the casings, pistons, and valve slides. The casings are the three cylindrical metal tubes that keep the pistons in place.The pistons move up and down inside the casings as you press on them. The pistons have small holes in them so that the air moves through them to produce different tones as you play. The valve slides change the length of the baritone’s tubing in order to produce different tones. There are three valve slides, and the first valve slide is the closest to the mouthpiece.Water key. The water key allows you to remove moisture from inside the horn. It is a small metal lever that is usually located on the main tuning slide. This part can be used by pressing on the key and blowing into the mouthpiece.Mouthpiece receiver. This part connects the mouthpiece to the baritone. It is typically a small metal cylinder that is fused to the end of the pipe that connects the baritone and mouthpiece.Mouthpiece. The mouthpiece a large, deeply cupped metal part that directs the air and lip vibrations into the baritone.Main tuning slide. This part of the instrument is used to make micro-tuning adjustments. The water key is located on top of this part., You will need to be able to read sheet music practice to your scales while playing. Look for a basic guide for beginners., The scales become more complicated as you advance in your practice. To begin with, search for beginner scale exercises.


Scales are usually thought of as a series of notes played from and back down again. Practice playing in that order.Scales are usually played out of order when you become more advanced. Try playing low and high notes together.

, A large part of playing the baritone is blowing air into your instrument. Breathing exercises will help you control the pitch you are playing, and allow you to gain stamina.Take twelve very small breaths of air in. Release the air in the next four counts. Repeat three or four times.
Start with your arms by your side. Take six breaths in as you raise your arms next to your head. Breath out six times as you lower your arms. You should be halfway through your six breaths when your arms are out straight at your sides.

, Determine if a group or individual class is best for you. A class with other students gives you multiple opinions and people to practice with. A private class offers focused attention on your technique and progress., Whether classes are in your future or not, practicing on your own is necessary. Sign up for an online class or watch YouTube videos to continue improving., There will probably come a time during your practice time when you encounter a tricky note or song that you get stuck on. Don’t be afraid to reach out to online message boards, YouTube, or other musicians in your area to ask questions about playing your instrument.

, Once you have built confidence in your playing, you could start looking for a band in your area seeking a baritonist. The band could play for fun, or for performance. Playing your music with and for others is a great way to take your playing to another level.


Look for a potential band on websites like Craigslist. Be sure that to be safe in any situation involving meeting with strangers, though.
Ask other musicians if they know anyone that needs a baritonist.
Form a band with other friends that play instruments.

, Unscrew the camp on the first valve. Pull the piston (inside the valve) out halfway, and put a few drops of oil onto the wide part of the piston. Put the piston back inside the valve and secure tightly. Repeat this step with the other two valves.Make sure to buy oil specifically made for instrument.
Do not put too much oil. It can damage other parts of your instrument., Use a mouthpiece brush to scrub it with warm water and dish soap. Repeat this process every week or so., Pull one slide out at a time, polish it with cloth, and grease it lightly. Replace the slide and repeat the process., Use a polish cloth and lightly rub it to remove fingerprints or any other unwanted blemishes. Do not use liquid polish because it can remove the instrument’s finish., Give your baritone a yearly check up at a repair shop to make sure there is nothing stuck in or wearing down your instrument. Take it more than once a year if you feel that your instrument is not playing like it should be."
"
Warm up properly.,
Start with a breathing exercise.,
Go down to 3 and 2 in the same pattern.,
Buzz (play) on your mouthpiece while it`s not in the instrument.

,
Start playing long tones, at a slow tempo, like 80 or 120.,
Perform a tongue exercise, at 130 or so a single octave scale is good.,
Without tonguing, change partials.,
When you play, use a lot of air.",How to Improve Tone Quality on a Brass Instrument," This helps more than anything.;
, One that is strong enough to impact your abs is the best. The exercise should include:


some inhale 4 counts
hold for 4
out for 4. At 80 or 120 bpm (beats per minute).

, At one, do an inhale of one count and exhale for one count, for a good 40 counts. This will hurt a little.

,, Long tones means a single note for 8 counts at a solid mouth force, no blasting or wimpy playing.

, (You can make your own warm-up for this.) This is good for fingers and slides too.

, This is called ""lip slurs"". The staff of notes above is best played by flutes - not trumpets! Start your practice of lip slurs on 2nd line G and slur smoothly down to open low C and back up to the G you started with. Continue chromatically after the open tones to these fingerings - (0), 2, 1, 12, 23, 13, 123. Use these daily like push ups. Once you can play these back and forth and slow to fast, start on higher notes; 3rd space C, top space E etc,

, Not only will this improve the tone quality, but it will also enable you to play a note for a longer period of time.

Smaller drum sets for junior drummers can be purchased online and at department stores, toy stores, and music shops. These smaller sets are similar to regular-sized drum sets and usually feature a small-scale bass drum, snare drum, a cymbal, and drum sticks.


Complete junior drum sets can cost around $300.Some toy drum sets at a toy store can cost between $80 and $150.Consider renting a drum set for your young drummer. Many music stores offer daily, weekly, or monthly rentals. A daily rental can cost around $175, while a monthly rental can cost around $300.Be sure to ask if there are delivery fees for the drum set. Both a delivery and a pick-up fee can cost around $40 for each trip.;
, Drum sets can be costly, so you may wish to purchase an all-inclusive, inexpensive drum set for a young drummer until you know that the child will take an interest in playing. A regular size, full drum set will be able to comfortably accommodate a taller child. An all-inclusive drum set should include the drums, also called the shells, along with cymbals, cymbal stands, a bass drum pedal, and a drummer’s stool.The cymbals and other hardware may be flimsy in the cheaper sets and may bend with frequent use.Be sure to read the descriptions of what is included if you are purchasing a drum set online to ensure that you are getting all the components your child needs.

, A properly treated, used drum set can be a less expensive option for a young drummer. Many music stores sell used instruments, and a reputable store will carefully survey each used instrument to ensure that they are selling a quality product to their customers. Be on the lookout for cracked drum shells and cymbals, and make sure that the hardware and cymbal stands are not bent.If there is a crack in a cymbal, it will get worse over time. Sometimes there are small cracks in the cymbal’s circular grooves and the center hole, so pay close attention to this area when looking at a used set., Before the child begins playing the drums, make sure that they have adequate protection for their ears.Soft foam or plastic ear plugs fit directly into your child’s ear canal and are an inexpensive and portable option.


To insert foam earplugs, roll the earplug between your hands to create a narrow tube shape. Gently place one end into the ear canal and hold it there for 20 to 30 seconds as it expands. If done properly, your child’s voice should sound muffled to them. Be sure to teach your child how to properly insert the earplugs before playing the drums.Be sure that their pediatrician is aware that they will be taking lessons and ask if they have any recommendations for protecting the child’s hearing.

, Earmuffs resemble headphones and completely cover your child’s ear. They are more expensive than earplugs, but they are easy for your child to put on quickly. Visit a local department store or music store so your child can try on earmuffs to find the right size and fit. Be sure that the earmuffs are not too loose and that they seal properly around your child’s ears.


If you child wears glasses, make sure that the earmuffs comfortably fit over them., A young drummer whose early development consists of undisciplined and unstructured playing will develop bad habits regarding technique, musicianship, and practice. A private instructor will keep the student's technique solid and will establish benchmarks that encourage the child to focus their practice. A weekly one-hour or 30-minute session is plenty to provide the student with direction and instruction in their drumming.


Visit a music shop in your town to see if they offer lessons or if they can put you in touch with a local instructor. Approach a local high school band director or faculty member at a university music department to see if any students or instructors offer private drum lessons.
Lessons can be between $10 to $30 dollars for 30 minutes of instruction, but this price can vary depending on your location and the instructor’s training and expertise., In addition to hiring a tutor, it is important to provide your child with other resources to provide well-rounded and thorough instruction. Method books detail the basics of drumming and provide practice tips and new rhythms to try. Instruction videos are also excellent tools for helping a child understand the fundamentals of drumming. Ask your child’s instructor or an expert at a local music shop for recommendations.


Most private instructors will provide method books for your child.
DVD and online drum lessons are other helpful resources in teaching drums to a child.

, After ensuring that your child has the correct drum set for their size and age, you will want to make sure that they are practicing good posture when they play. Poor posture may cause your child’s back or neck to ache, and this discomfort will not encourage your child to keep practicing. A proper position will also make it easier for your child to access all of the sections of the drum set.Don’t slouch! Encourage your child to sit up straight, which will help reduce pressure on their lower back. Adjust the height of the drummer’s stool so that your child’s feet comfortably reach the pedals. Their knees should rest at an angle between 90 and 110 degrees., To prevent strain and to help your child play correctly, it is important that your child hold the drumsticks properly. The child should hold the drumstick a third of the way up the stick. They should grip it between their thumb and index finger to achieve a proper swing. The others fingers should be wrapped around the drumstick gently, with the ring and pinky finger resting beneath the stick.As your child progresses, they may learn various drumstick grips.

, Although it is not necessary for a child to know how to read music before they begin to learn the drums, it is important that they review and understand sheet music as they progress. The child’s method books, instructional videos, and tutor should cover these basics during their lessons. Begin by introducing basic music notations and symbols for standard music before moving on to percussion notations. Most drumming notations use the lines and spaces in a bar of music to represent the various drums of a drum kit.Review musical notations with your child. Ask them to identify various musical notes and see if they can count the beat.

, Having good rhythm is crucial for becoming a good drummer. Encourage your child to practice a few bars of basic rhythms each day to help build this foundation. They should practice various rhythms slowly so that they are accurate and in time. Remind your child that it is not about speed, but rather feeling the beat correctly., Long practice sessions may be overwhelming for a young drummer, which may cause your child to lose interest in the instrument or confidence in their abilities. To keep the practice sessions fun and encouraging, plan the practice schedule with your child. Asking for their input helps the child feel engaged and in control. Recommend that they start out with short practice sessions each day for 5, 10, or 15 minutes.As the child gets older and improves, encourage them to practice longer or until they feel like they have accomplished something.

, Ask your child to think about the goals they have for each practice session. One practice session may include learning two bars of a new song, while another session may be geared toward improving drumming eighth note beats.Having obtainable goals will help the child feel successful and confident after each practice session. Practice will be associated with positive emotions and achievements rather than frustration or boredom.

, Drum pads are excellent tools for practicing in relative silence.They have striking surfaces made from gum rubber or neoprene, and can be held in the child's lap or placed on a snare drum stand during practice. Having a drum pad available will allow the child to practice when playing loudly on a drum set would not be appropriate.

, Support your child and inspire them to keep practicing by being positive and encouraging. Let them know that you are proud of them and that they are doing a great job.


Take an interest in their music, and ask them about what they are currently working on in their lessons.
If your child seems frustrated or upset with their progress, take that opportunity to praise their progress and accomplishments. “I heard you were practicing the new song you learned during your last lesson. Your sixteenth notes sound great! Keep up the great work.” Your child’s confidence will grow, and they will be motivated to continue practicing.

, Introduce new ways to keep practice fun and exciting. Take your child to a music concert, or set-up an at-home concert where your child performs for your family, the neighbors, their toys—anyone! Establish a reward system for the amount of time they spend practicing. If they practice for 3 hours each week, you could reward them with more allowance money or a trip to their favorite candy shop.Changing up the routine of practice can make it more fun and exciting for your child.

Turn your bass when it no longer sounds crisp and clean.,
Test the head for tightness by pressing in with your thumb.,
Using your fingers, tighten all of the bolts around the face of the drum.,
Tighten the topmost bolt one-half turn with a drum key.,
Tighten the bolt directly opposite your first bolt, turning the same amount.To keep even tension on the drum you need to tighten bolts in opposing pairs.,
Continue tightening around the drum, always working in opposing pairs.,
Press your thumb into the drum about 1"" inward from each bolt, testing for even tightness.",How to Tune a Bass Drum1," You need to tune your drum regularly to keep their sound sharp and clean, as opposed to uncontrollable or muddy resonance. Resonance is when the linger effects of the sound, such as how quickly the sound dies out.


You must tune your bass drum if you've replaced either head.
If you're having trouble with the sound, particularly with ""decay"" (kick drums generally want very little sustain),, you have issues with your front head. Check it first before you get to the batter head -- both sides are important for sound.;
, It should feel tight to the touch, but still have some give. It shouldn't feel hard, but it shouldn't have a ton of give, either -- 1/2"" at most.


The front, or resonant, head is the one that faces the audience while you play., You're not tuning just yet, simply getting the process started. You don't even want to get the bolts as tight as possible, just to the point of light resistance.


For a way-out-of-tune drum, it can help to first loosen everything and then start from scratch.

, Turn your key clockwise 180-degrees to tighten the bolt. But topmost bolt, the the bolt at 12:00, or nearest that, if the drum was a clock. Press your thumb into the head right next to this bolt when you're done -- it should be tight, but still have some give.


If you've gone too tight, loosen it a quarter turn. Don't worry if it isn't tight enough yet.

, After you finish the 12:00 bolt, you need to tighten the 6:00 bolt, or the bolt in a straight line across from the one you just finished.


Think of the head as a perfectly even tug-of-war match. Each bolt pulls evenly against the ones across from it, keeping everything from sliding or stretching unevenly., Keep working in pairs -- a half turn at the 3:00 bolt followed by a half turn of the

, After each spot, lightly tighten or loosen the bolt to ensure that the drum feels the same the entire way around. You want the exact same tightness across the drum. Remember, as always, to test and tighten in opposing pairs.


Visually, the front head should only have a few (if any) wrinkles on it.
Remember, you need some give. Kick drums, in particular, can be left a little looser to get a deeper, lower-frequency tone."
"
Loosen each rod on the top head until they almost come off.,
Stretch the new head, if installing one.,
Tighten each bolt as much as you can by hand.,
Tighten each bolt a half turn with the drum key, working in opposing pairs.,
Test the head 1"" from each bolt using a drumstick, adjusting as necessary.",How to Tune a Bass Drum2," This isn't necessary for a quick tuning, but for the best results you should always start from scratch. Loosen all of the tension rods so that they are still installed but are placing no pressure on the drum head., If this is a replacement job, and not a simple tuning, place the new head on and tighten the bolts a quarter turn each. Using your palm, press deeply into the new head to stretch it out. A head stretches once it's tightened in place, meaning it will go slack (and need more re-tuning) if not pre-stretched., Tighten the batter head with the same system of opposing pairs used on the front head. Remember that if you tune the 12:00 first, you've got to jump to the 6:00 right after. You can then move to the 3:00 and the 9:00, and so on.

, You're still working in opposing pairs of tension rods. Remember, it is just a 180 turn on each rod to start -- you'll adjust later. If you had a string connecting each tension rod to the rod straight across from it, they would be pulling on each other with even strength.

, Hit the head with a stick at the same point in front of each tension rod. Unless you lucked out on a perfect tuning, each rod will likely sound a little bit different. Use your drum key to get them perfectly aligned.


Test all the rods first and see what sound you like best, or which sound is most common. Tune the rest to this.
Tightening the rod makes it higher pitched while loosening it will make it sound deeper.

"
"
Cut porthole to help record the kick drum and get a punchier sound.,
Think about damping your kick drum during quieter gigs and spaces.,
Leave the drum heads tuned a little looser than normal for an even deeper sound.,
Keep playing and experimenting to find your perfect tone.",How to Tune a Bass Drum3," If you cut a hole in the resonant (front) head, this can help you make your bass drum sound a bit little less warm and resonant. Most importantly, it helps place microphones nice and close to the kick drum fir recording. Some considerations with a porthole include:


Keep the hole between 3""-5"" in diameter.
Place the hole near the edge of the drum -- 3:00 or 5:00 position is best.
Consider testing drums with and without holes before you start cutting., Damping is placing a towel or pillow in the kick drum to absorb some of the vibrations. You can also buy dedicated products for damping, or tape a towel to the rim of the front head for a smaller effect. Damping has several benefits, but you should always test the sound out before committing to a damping strategy. Some effects of damping include:


Slightly quieter head and sound
Less resonance, leading to a punchier strike
More tone control -- move the damper to different parts of the kick drum for different sounds., Loosen up the bolts on the batter head if you want an even deeper, lower frequency sound. The looser the head, the deeper the sound. Loosening the resonant head can help as well, but it can also muddy up your sound if loosened too much.


Note, however, that looser heads create more resonance. Many drummers use some damping to control these effects.

, Drum tuning doesn't have a melodic key you need to hit. It is more about your personal sound than any ""right"" amount of tuning. Keep mixing and matching tightness, damping, portholes, and even the type of beaters you use to hit the drum to find your personal bass drum tone.


Sometimes the right tuning depends on the style of music. Pop and rock tends to like sharp but deep kick drums, whereas jazz drummers may be a bit more ""splashy.""

Read all warnings and prepare containers of water, etc.,
Remove and disassemble all slides and valves, remembering how they go back together.

,
Take the body of the tuba and set it on top of a towel in a bath-tub full of warm, not hot, water and a little mild, non-abrasive soap.,
Get a strong person to help you carefully rotate the tuba head over heels,so to speak, to get all the water out and then let it air-dry on a soft bath towel.

,
While it's drying place all slides in the soapy water and rub gently with wet paper towels to clean.,
Put all parts of the valves except the felt or rubber bumpers (which are very easily replaced if need be) and any other parts that aren't metal in the soapy water and clean with wet paper towel.,
When all parts of your tuba (or other brass piston instrument), including the body are completely dry, reassemble the valves, putting a few drops of valve oil around the top of them and twist them back in to place on the tuba.

,
Before putting the slides back in, put a small amount of slide grease on the part that goes inside the tuba and rub on with a paper towel, not your finger remember, and wipe off any excess.",How to Clean and Maintain a Tuba," before starting.;
,, Rub gently with a washcloth to remove all yucky stuff. If you have to pick the tuba up during cleaning be very careful because it's heavy when full of water.

,, Clean the insides of them with the snake. Rinse them in the clean water then dry off with a paper towel and set them somewhere safe.

, Rinse in normal water and dry with more paper towels. Don't use the snake through those little holes in the valves.

,, Then slide back into place on tuba and re-tune before you next play.

Get some drums and other percussion instruments.,
Steer away from electronics.,
Get enough instruments for one to five people, or more.

,
Don't forget the obvious: a ""drum circle"" is a circle!,
Create circles within circles once the circle is bigger than 20 participants.,
Find a nice outdoor location for your drum circle, like a big backyard, or a nearby park so people from the public can join in.

,
Always welcome those who walk in and want to join the fun.

,
Go indoors if it is going to be chilly, or wet, or dark.

,
Have at least one person who has a little experience so he/she can start the beats and/or maintain a steady motion.,
Understand that rhythms are spontaneous, one person starts a beat or a rhythm then someone else adds on to it, so on and so forth.

,
Start off with slow beats and vibes, eventually the drum circle will rise with adrenaline but you have to let it happen, don't force it.

,
Don't be shy or timid, drum circles are supposed to be fun.,
Be friendly and admire each others' attempts and making music.,
Play friendly and supportive, don't get involved in competitive or aggressive playing.,
Remember that we all share the space with our neighbors!",How to Start Up a Drum Circle," such as: Djembes, Doumbeks, Tablas, Congas, tambourines, Shakers or any other hand drum. Don't forget frame drums! Another good idea is to have some sort of bass drum, such as a sangba or surdo.;
, Drum circles are usually tribal in nature, so crazy electronic or technical instruments such as keyboards, drums sets, and electric guitars are not recommended.

,, Set up in a real circle so that everybody may see and hear one another. Irregular blob shapes make for choppy or chaotic environments.

, If it gets too spread out, you lose connection. For massive circles, create levels with center circle on the floor, next on chairs, outside standing.

,,,, This is not really necessary once you have some experience as a facilitator, beginners get the idea very quickly.

,,, start off slow and wait for a good moment for you to come in.

, good vibes = a great drum circle.

, One mutually supportive game is to play a few beats, and let others add beats to that, and keep adding a few beats until a whole new and unpredictable rhythm is created!

, Playing too loud or too long will not endear your drum circle to the rest of the community. Think about what you REALLY want to accomplish.

Buy a rotary tumbler.,
Purchase a vibratory tumbler.,
Purchase case cleaning products.,
Use corn cob.,
Opt for walnut shell.,
Go for stainless steel pins.,
Sort your brass casings.,
Set the machine.,
Run the machine.,
Rinse your brass casings.,
Dry the casings.",How to Clean Brass Casings," For the simplest brass cleaning option, buy a rotary tumbler. Rotary tumblers are machines that polish and clean, and are a good option for cleaning brass casings in that they operate quietly and cost less than other tumblers. The disadvantages of this tumbler are that they operate slowly and use more polishing media than other tumblers., Vibratory tumblers are a loud but fast option for cleaning brass casings. Depending on the model you choose, and the size and condition of your casings, cleaning might take between 2-3 hours.Choose a newer model with a built-in timer to make cleaning easier, and determine what size you should buy based on your needs (e.g. large models can hold up to 900, 9mm cases)..

, Keep up to date on what products are available for case cleaning by visiting message boards online or browsing online stores. For the best clean, choose a cleaning solution that will remove powder fouling residue, dirt, and discoloration. For instance, the Iosso case cleaner kit contains a bottle of cleaning solution, as well as a bucket and strainer bag, to submerge and clean up to 1,500 brass casings., If you only need to give your brass casings a light cleaning, opt for corn cob media. Brass casings which have only been fired once, or that are not overly tarnished, can be cleaned with this media. Shop for treated corncob media, which contains an extra polishing compound that will leave your brass looking extra clean., Brass casings that are more heavily tarnished, either used without a cleaning for many re-loadings or left on the ground for too long, need an aggressive media. Walnut shell is a good option that can be used in both rotary and vibratory tumblers. Purchase treated walnut shell media rather than untreated walnut shell media, which would require you to add extra polish to clean your casings effectively. , Stainless steel pins are the most effective media for cleaning brass casings as they clean them inside more effectively than walnut shell and corncob. This media also does not require extra polish, but it can only be used in a rotary tumbler. Add dish detergent or a cleaning product to the mix for the most effective clean possible. , Always make sure to sort your brass casing by size and type before cleaning them. If you do not sort them, the smaller casings may become lodged inside the larger casing during the tumbling process, or be damaged by them. Lay down an old towel or sheet and spread out your casings on it, then separate them into different containers., To start cleaning your casings, add the media of your choice to the machine, as well as some polishing powder, and your brass casings. If you are using stainless steel pins as media in a rotary tumbler, add water and dish detergent, or another cleaning product. Shut the tumbler firmly and start the machine.Refer to the directions for your particular machine to determine the quantities of media and polishing agent to add.

, If you are using a vibratory tumbler, run it for 2-3 hours to clean your casings. If you are using a rotary tumbler, you will have to run it longer (closer to 8 hours). Check your casings when you stop the machine to determine if you would like them to be cleaner, and add time accordingly., To remove any debris that might remain from the cleaning media, rinse your brass casings under water. Separate them from the media by hand and place them in a large strainer, or in a large bucket (using a small strainer to rinse one small portion of them at a time). Rinse under water until all signs of debris are gone., After rinsing your casings, lay a dry towel onto the ground, Spread out your newly washed casings in a single layer on the towel. Leave them out to air dry for several days to ensure that they are fully dry. "

Be creative.",How to Set Up a Drum Kit," In addition to the drums and cymbals themselves, you'll also want to make sure you have a small but important tool called a drum key handy. This tool is used to tighten and loosen some of the smaller bolts in the drum kit and is essential if you ever need to disassemble one of the drums (like, for instance, if you need to replace a head). For a standard-size drum kit, your kit will probably include most, if not all, of the following drum pieces:









Snare drum
Bass (kick) drum (with pedal)
Hi-hat cymbal (with pedal)
Crash cymbal
Ride Cymbal
Toms and/or floor tom
Throne (the ""stool"" you sit on);
, You'll want an area with enough room that you'll be able to set up your drum without crowding the pieces together. When you play, you should be able to make fluid, natural movements. Positioning your pieces too close together can make playing somewhat difficult and can even negatively impact your sound (like, for instance, if a cymbal bangs into an adjacent drum when it's struck).









Though drum sets with different numbers of pieces will naturally take up different amounts of space, a good rule of thumb is that a given area of floor is big enough for your kit if you can lay on the ground spread-eagle without touching anything.

, Before you begin to assemble your drum set, you may want to give your pieces a quick once-over to look for any problems that may require maintenance. If you spot anything that's out of order, you'll want to address these problems now, rather than later, as disassembling your entire drum kit to perform maintenance on some small part can be a tremendous pain. Below are just a few common issues you may want to look for:









Worn-out drum heads
Squeaky kick drum pedals
""Bald"" rubber support feet
Dust and grime buildup from normal use

, The bass drum is the first drum you'll set up - from this, you'll build up the rest of the drum set. Set the bass drum on the floor vertically so that the outer head (which usually contains the logo or brand name) faces away from where you intend to sit.








, Grab the two metal legs that attach to the bass drum and slip them into the holes on either side of the drum. Tighten the brackets hold by turning the knobs. Be sure that the legs reach all the way to the ground and are angled slightly forward so that they can support most of the drum's weight as you press on the foot pedal. Some drum sets will come with pre-attached legs that you must loosen, drop to the floor, and then tighten.









Note that some bass drum legs will have spikes on the tips and others will have rubber 'feet'. For carpeted floors, you can use either, but avoid using spiked legs on a hard surface such as wood flooring, as these can leave gouges and marks.

, Usually, the foot pedal you use to play the kick drum is secured to the bottom edge of the bass drum with a screw-on ""bracket"". Slip the bottom edge of the foot pedal assembly under the bottom center of the bass drum, then tighten the upper part of the pedal assembly by turning its screw. The pedal should ""clamp"" onto the bottom edge of the bass drum, holding itself in place.









Other pedal configurations (like double bass pedals) will have more complex assembly processes. Consult any instructions included with your pedals for more information.

, Use the knob or lever underneath the cushion of your throne to make the throne taller or shorter. Test different heights by sitting on the throne and giving your kick drum a few hits with the pedal. This should be comfortable and easy. Most drummers play with their knees bent at approximately a 90 degree angle.









However, other arrangements are possible - almost any throne height is fine if it allows you to play easily and hit the kick drum without pushing it forward.

, The snare drum usually sits in a short stand with three adjustable horizontal arms that hold it in place - usually, the ends of these arms are rubberized to keep the snare from moving while you play it. The stand itself is fairly easy to set up - simply spread the legs at the bottom so that the stand stays upright and use the mechanism at the top to lift and adjust the angles of the arms.









The snare should sit securely in the stand's arms at a roughly horizontal angle, though, again, any positioning that's comfortable for you is valid. For instance, Daru Jones, a drummer who has toured with artists including Jack White, plays his drums in an unconventional arrangement, with some of his drums slanted downward toward the floor.

, Loosen the main nut on the snare stand to adjust its height via the telescoping central column. You'll want your snare at a level that allows you to play it without hitting your legs. This is usually a little higher than the tops of your knees.









For most rock-style playing, you'll want the snare to sit in front of and slightly to the left of the kick drum so that you can hit it with the left hand stick (assuming a right-handed setup) with the stick nearly flat. This allows for a good crack and the ability to make a 'rim-shot' hit as needed.

, Most bass drums include a metal bracket on top that will allow you to mount two toms in a way similar to how you mounted the bass drum's legs. Usually, there will be two separate holes on top of the bass drum - one for each tom's metal mounting pole. Sometimes there may only be one hole, in which case you'll have to mount both toms on one central pole. Note that the precise way that the Toms attach may differ between drum brands, so make sure to check any included factory set-up instructions if you are unsure of how to proceed.









The precise positioning of the toms is a personal preference. However, you should make sure they are positioned close enough and at a proper angle to allow quick switching between toms when seated (usually this means you'll want the heads angled towards you and slightly towards each other).

, Most floor toms have long, thin metal legs with rubber feet and a small ""bend"" so that the feet can be offset from the edges of the drum. Loosen the knobs on the side of the floor tom and insert the legs (feet facing down). Tighten the nuts so that the drum sits slightly above the feet and is well-balanced. Sit in the throne and give it a few good hits to ensure it won't move while you play it.









Usually, assuming a right-handed set up, the floor tom sits in front of and to the right of the bass drum so that it can be comfortably hit with the right hand.

, You'll want to be able to to hit your floor tom without any unnecessary effort, so adjust its legs until it's roughly horizontal and roughly at the level of your snare drum.









Of course, as mentioned above, if an alternate positioning makes it easier for you to play, feel free to use it.

, The hi hat stand is a straight, medium-height one that usually has an attached pedal and three legs at the bottom. Spread the legs out to give the hihat a wide base of support. Then, slide the bottom hihat cymbal on top of the hihat stand so that the ""cupped"" side points up. Usually, this means you'll have to thread the narrow top part of the high hat stand through the hole in the center of the cymbal. This cymbal just sits in its place - it does not screw into anything.









If you're having trouble telling the difference between the top and bottom hihat cymbals, usually, the top cymbal will bear the name and logo of the manufacturer, while the bottom one will be relatively unmarked. Often, the two cymbals are essentially constructed identically, so you may not even need to worry.

, Unscrew the bottom nut on the hihat clutch - this is what holds the top hihat cymbal to the hihat stand. Place the top hihat cymbal between the 2 felt pads inside the hihat Clutch. Screw the nut back on the bottom and put the hihat clutch onto the hihat stand. Test the hihat by hitting while pressing the pedal. It should produce a thin ""click"" when the pedal is pressed down and a loud ""hiss"" the pedal isn't pressed down.









Usually, the hihat sits to the left of the snare so that it can be hit with the right hand stick (which ""crosses over"" the left hand stick on the snare). The pedal is usually pressed with the left foot.

, Usually, the ride cymbal comes with a stand that has a curved base with three supporting legs and an upper portion that stands at an angle. Spread the legs to support the stand, then unscrew the nut at the top of the stand and position the ride cymbal between the two felt pads. Re-tighten the nut, but not too tight - the cymbal should be allowed to ""swing"" if it's hit hard. Finally, tighten the knob and adjust the height of the cymbal to a comfortable level.









Generally, the ride cymbal is positioned on the right side of the drum kit, over and behind the floor tom and the bass drum. The cymbal itself usually hangs over the floor tom somewhat, though not enough to impede access to the drum.

, Most standard drum kits also come with at least one crash cymbal. The stand for this cymbal may have an adjustable arm like that of the ride cymbal or may simply sit straight up and down. Regardless, the crash cymbal is installed in basically the same way as the ride. Don't forget to keep from re-tightening the nut too tightly - it's important for cymbals to be able to move fairly freely.

The crash usually is positioned on the left side of the drum kit, over and behind the bass drum and hihat. Any additional cymbals are usually spaced around the sides and back of the kick drum.

, Congratulations - assuming it has no additional accessories, your drum kit should be completely set up. Give it a quick test to ensure that all the pieces are properly-positioned and in working order. Make sure that you can reach every piece of the kit so that you can perform fills without any difficulty.

Some drummers like to customize their setup with additional drums and accessories. Below are just a few common options you may want to consider:

Double bass pedals
Cowbells/Jam blocks
Additional toms (sometimes tuned to specific notes)
Chimes, bells, and other auxiliary percussion instruments



, Being a good drummer involves creating your own style. All of the greats play their own way and have their kits set up a different way. Always experiment with what you have, just don't go too crazy that you can't play. If you can make it work, then you can do it!"

Place the suspension ring batter side down.,

Turn on your snare and start tuning them up.",How to Set up Your Sleishman Drum Kit (Snare),";
, Make sure the gaps in the hoop (called Snare Gates) line up with the Snare mechanisms. Screw in the tension bolts so they don't fall out. Don't tighten too much.

, The T-Nut is what your Tension Bolts screw into instead of Lugs, you can see them inside the Suspension Ring. The general idea is you're trying to get the snare side of the system pre-leveled before you put the shell in.

, Here is where it gets a little tricky. Snares have a little depression in the shell called a Snare Bed. It is vital that the snares are aligned correctly with the snare bed. To find the snare bed on your shell, look for either a sticker or a shallow cut on the inside on the shell.


This snare has a small dot instead of those.







, An easy way to do this is to take two opposite sided tension bolts, and screw them in just enough that the suspension ring or the top of the T-nut stops moving.

, Don't tighten it too much, 2 turns should be enough., Because of the way Sleishman drums work, the bottom head won't have similar tension on all of the bolts. So go around and tighten any bolts that are very loose. Don't over tighten, you're aiming for as close to the same tension on each bolt as you can.

, As Sleishman drums are under constant refining, this article won't discuss how to attach the snares to the snare mechanism. However, once again, make sure that the snare wires are sitting directly in the middle of the snare bed and in the middle of the drum. If you get it off, it will have an undesirable sound.

, Because you've set up the drum already, all your tuning happens from the top head., How you tune your snares is you tighten them up and tap on the drum lightly. If it sounds like a tom, it's too tight. Start loosening it up until you can hear the snares responding to your lightest touch. Once you've done that, your snare drum is done.

Place snare drum on a flat surface
,

Loosen (counterclockwise motion) the nuts and bolts around the rim of the head.

While there are dozens of head producing companies, be sure to get a snare head.,

Place new head atop the drum and line up the nuts and bolts.

Tuning a drum must be completed in a very specific manner.,Place snare on stand and play away!",How to Replace and Tune a Snare Drum Head,",,, Any other kind of head will cause the snare to not sound as it should.

Most heads have size and information (""snare, tom, timpani head"" etc.) on the back of the package. Examine the package for a minute to see if it is the proper head for your snare drum.

,,, As you see in the picture provided, the drum key is at what would be 12:00. To tune properly, go clockwise and across (12:00-6:00, 1:00-7:00, 2:00-8:00 etc.). The reason for this is so that all ends are evenly tightened so that the head is leveled physically and sonically.,"

Care for your tuba properly.",How to Play a Tuba," Tubas are quite expensive when new, but it shouldn't be too hard to find a used tuba for under 2000 dollars, or even lower. If you’re joining a school band, you can usually rent tubas directly. Most concert tubas are available in a few different pitches, which may be more appropriate for the style of music you plan on playing. You can get tubas pitched in BBb, CC, Eb, and F.Eb tuba is used for brass bands (almost exclusively) and some soloing
F tuba is used for passages requiring higher notes and solo works. It is also seen in small ensemble settings (brass quintet, brass quartet, etc)
BBb and CC tubas are intended for large ensemble playing (band, orchestra, etc.) BBb tubas are more common at the high school, college, and amateur level as sousaphones are pitched in BBb, but professional orchestra players in the U.S. use CC tubas. In Europe it can vary from country to country.;
, Mouthpieces come in different sizes, so be sure to get one that is best suited for you and your size. Generally made of fiberglass or composite metal, a good mouthpiece is essential to a properly tuned and played instrument.


If you buy a used tuba, or rent one, make sure you get your own new mouthpiece. A good quality mouthpiece is important to develop the proper buzzing technique and breath support.
A fiberglass mouthpiece is sometimes used as an alternative because temperature doesn't effect its intonation as much as a metal mouthpiece. Fiberglass mouthpieces may work and are more inexpensive but you lose some quality sound and overtones.

, Tubas are not generally played standing up, unless you're playing a sousaphone, which is designed for use in a marching band. In order to practice, you'll need a good chair, in which you can maintain proper posture and balance to build the skills that will keep your notes pure.


Get a basic hard-backed chair without any arm wrests, or a stool that you can sit on comfortably. Avoid practicing on the couch, in a recliner, or in otherwise less-than-upright conditions. You can't get the breath-support necessary to play correctly, and you'll build poor habits into your practice routine.

, No point in learning the mechanics of the tuba if you can't read the music or apply what you've learned. While it's difficult to learn to play any instrument properly from a book, it's a great way to get the basics down and figure out how to start playing music on the tuba, as well as how to hold and play it properly.


If you're trying to use a computer to aid you, having a projector connected to it is probably the only way it wouldn't be an inconvenience. It's good to get started online, but finding a professional method book is the best way to learn an instrument. Wait to troubleshoot technique issues online after you've got the fundamentals down.

, Your back should be straight, and your head should be lifted comfortably so that you're looking straight ahead at the conductor, if there is one, or straight ahead if you're playing alone. Your back should not be touching the back of the chair, your feet flat on the floor., Depending on your height, it may be appropriate to rest the tuba on the chair between your legs or rest it on your lap, gently on the top of your thighs. If it's a full-size tuba, you may want to get a stand to set it on.


It's important to position the tuba in such a way that you will not have to bend yourself to reach the mouthpiece. Bring the horn to you, don't bend to the horn. When you try to fill the horn with air, you'll notice a big difference.

, On a right-handed tuba, you'll lean the tuba slightly to the left, using your left hand to support the lean. Place your right hand on the valves, either on the broad part of the pad on a rotary tuba, or with your fingertips on the center of the valves on a valve tuba.


Most tubas have a small ring to put your thumb through. This forces your hand to stay in place and helps give a bit of support from your right hand. Find the ring, if your tuba has one, and position your hand accordingly.
On a lefty tuba, you'll be resting the tuba practically on your left leg which is why stands are very important for lefty players. Your right hand has to reach for the valves, but it will also be providing a lot of support. The left hand will keep things balanced.

, Let your lap support the tuba, not your arms. Try to relax your shoulders and let your arms hold the tuba loosely. Treat it like your date, not like your wrestling partner. The more comfortably you can move around the horn, the better you'll be able to play.

, Remember, this is a big instrument, so your air needs to be big and fast to get the sound out out of the horn. Breath deep down into your diaphragm, not up high in your throat. That air has a long way to go, so start it out from a place of power.


Unless you're playing a Sousaphone in a marching band, the goal is not to blow all of your air reserves through the horn at once, but to keep your diaphragm taunt. If someone were to punch you in the stomach, you should stay tight and not collapse. Tense your abdominal muscles while you play and while you blow., While blowing, close your lips to the point that it vibrates in the mouthpiece. Keep blowing and vibrating your lips so that sound gets out of the tuba. As tuba is a large brass, try blowing a raspberry into the mouthpiece. That's the kind of vibration you are looking at. Once you've got your buzz figured out, start your note by saying either ""ta"" or ""da"" into the mouthpiece, depending on how you want to articulate the note.


A properly maintained ""embouchure"" is critical to playing brass instruments. It's difficult to buzz your lips properly when you're first learning how to play.
Don't puff out your cheeks. It's a waste of air that should be going into your horn, it looks silly, and you'll end up with very sore cheeks after only a brief period of playing.

, At any given position or configuration of keys pressed and open, you can play a number of notes, usually three. Some beginners have difficulty hitting a note right the first time, but don't worry too much while you're just getting started. Practice feeling where the different registers are.


Pinch your cheeks and your lips as you blow to control the amount of air that comes through your ""buzz."" You can raise or lower the pitch of the note in the same position, accordingly.
Try associating how the note will sound, where the note is on the staff, what it feels like to play the note, and the fingering for it. Many beginners only associate the note on the staff and the fingering for it, so they become confused when playing notes with the same fingering but different mouth positions.

, Once you've started to get a feel for the register of the tuba, start experimenting with fingerings. Press the keys and practice doing so in time with the notes that you play. Whether you're studying along with a book or receiving lessons, start practicing fingering the keys fully and playing clear notes with the valves pressed.


Most guide books should come with finger charts, which correspond the fingerings to the specific notes on the scale that you want to play. This is an excellent way to learn to play.
Push the valve in the center, not on the rim. Pushing it on the rim can make the valve stuck.

, Start learning your fingerings and playing scales to develop the fundamentals to start playing music.Scales might not be the most exciting thing to learn when you're first getting started, but before you know it you'll be able to hit all the right ones to play the ""Imperial March"" from Star Wars (the ""Stairway to Heaven"" of the tuba) and take off from there.

, The tuba is both a rhythmic and a melodic instrument, providing the big, sturdy, bottom line of the band. To be the best tuba player you can be, it's important to practice playing rhythmically, so you play not only the right notes, but the right notes at the right time. Great tuba players are as rhythmically precise as a drummer and as melodically clear as a trumpet player.


Practice with a metronome. Even when you're playing scales, play them in time. When you're playing your practice songs, play them in time. Learn to internalize that sense of time by tapping your feet and paying close attention to your rhythmic motion.
Practice your counting. Sometimes, tuba notes will be spaced out very far, meaning that you'll mostly be counting empty measures on some songs. Develop a good method for counting rests to make sure you're always on time for your big notes.

, Tuba is a much better instrument when you play it with others. Sometimes, the sheet music for a song on tuba involves only a few notes, which you can learn quickly and get bored with just as fast. But when you add the trumpets and the trombones, the flutes and the clarinets, those few notes become so much more. You're making music.


Consider taking private lessons as well. Like most instruments, learning a tuba properly usually requires in-person instruction. Whether you receive that in school band or in private lessons, getting one-on-one instruction is a good way of keeping you from building bad habits and moving forward with your playing. Explore good instructors available in your area and sign up.

, These slightly more advanced techniques are useful for playing fast passages, when you're called for. While this isn't something that you need to start learning when you're first getting to know your way around the tuba, developing the clarity, tone, and speed of your notes can be helped with learning to tongue quickly.


When double tonguing, think either ta-ka-ta-ka or da-ga-da-ga. Try saying it first, and when you try double tonguing, think as if your tongue is moving in one of the two ways described above.
Triple tonguing has four approaches: Ta-ta-ka, ta-ka-ta, da-da-ga, or da-ga-da. Try all, and choose the one that works best on you and stick with it.

, A tuba isn't as delicate as say, a violin, but it is still quite prone to denting and scratching. Always transport your instrument in a case and learn to maintain your tuba to get the best possible sound.


Empty the water that is in your tuba frequently by pushing the water key and blowing air into the instrument without vibrating your lips.
Check individual valves by pressing down each one in turn and blowing; if there's any water in the tubing, it should sound and feel obvious. You may need to remove the tubing or rotate the tuba to clear everything.
Find somewhere for tuba repairs. Professional instrument repairmen might charge you a pretty penny for fixing things, but they know what they're doing and it's better than ruining a giant investment by messing with something you don't understand.

Turn your snare when it sounds ""wet,"" and the sound isn't sharp and crisp anymore.,
Test the bottom head for tightness.,
Unlock the snare wires.,
Hand tighten all of the nuts around the top of the head.,
Use a drum key to tighten the top-most bolt 1/2 a turn.,
Use the key to tighten the bottom-most bolt as far as you turned the first one.,
Continue working around the drum head by tightening the bolts in opposite pairs.,
Test the head with your thumb roughly 1"" in from each bolt.,
Loosen all of the rods on the top head almost completely.,
Let the new skin stretch if you are tuning a new head.,
Tighten all of the tension rods by hand.,
Use your drum key to tighten each pair of rods 1/2 a turn.,
Using a stick, test the drum 1"" inch away from each rod.,
Play the snare to test it's overall sound.,
Reclamp the snare switch down.,
Experiment to find the type of tone you're after.",How to Tune a Snare Drum," You should also retune your drum if it sounds uneven. When hitting it, the distance to the edge of the drum will change the sound. However, you should get the same sound from spots that are equally far away from the edge (for example, 2"" from the right edge of the drum should have the same tone as 2"" from the top, bottom, left, etc).


You should also retune your snare if you've replaced either head.
If you're having trouble with your sound, particularly the ""decay"" (how long the sound lasts for), you likely have issues with your bottom head. Always check if it is loose before tuning the top head.;
, Press your thumbs around the edges of the bottom of the drum. It should be relatively tight. Not so tight that it feels hard, but it shouldn't have a lot of give. If you touch your thumb and pinky together on your left hand, then poke the fleshy part of your palm under the thumb with your fingers, you can get a good idea how it should feel.


There should just be a little give.
The resonant head is clear, and has snare wires across it., These are the thin metal wires running across your snare drum. There are two clamps on either side of the drum that clip the wires down. Unlock them so the snares are free.


If you hit the top of the drum, you'd hear a deeper sound without the ringing, snare-like sound. This means the snares are unlocked.

, Just use your fingers to get the sides around as tight as possible, though if you have access to a drum key, it is much easier to use that.

, Rotate the key clockwise 180-degrees to tighten it. Use your thumb to test the head once again. Remember, it should be tight, but still have a few millimeters of give under your thumb.


If it is too tight, turn it back a quarter turn.

, In order to keep the tension on the drum even, you want to always tighten the bolts in opposite pairs. So, after tightening the 12:00 bolt, move on to the 6:00. Again, test the tightness before moving on.


Think of the drum head as a game of tug-of-war. You want all sides to be pulling on the head equally, otherwise it stretches too far in one direction and becomes uneven., So, if you move to the bolt at 1:00, you then tighten the 7:00 bolt. Keep moving around the drum like this until you've tightened all of the bolts evenly. There are usually eight total bolts.

, Move your fingers around the drum, testing each spot. You want even tension throughout. If it is not even, use the drum key to tighten the loose heads to align with the others.


There should not be any wrinkles across the bottom head when you are done.
Remember, you need some give. Resonant heads are thin, and can snap if over-tuned., If you're doing a light tuning, this is unnecessary. However, for the best results you should start from scratch, tuning the drum up all at once. Loosen the bolts on the tension rods so that there is no tension on the head, but the rods are still in., Use the heel of your hand to press into the snare lightly, pushing it into the drum. This stretches it out, which will prevent it from falling out of tune as quickly later on.

, The snare catches should still be unhooked. Turn the drum over and tighten all of the bolts on the head by hand until you can't turn them anymore. Tighten the snare using the same system of opposing pairs. If you tune the 12:00 first, tune the 6:00 second. Then move on to the 1:00 and the 7:00, etc.


For perfect drum tuning, get out a ruler and measure the distance from under the hoop to the top of the lugnut. They should all be even. This, however, is likely not necessary for casual players, or those playing looser music like rock and roll., Remember, you want to work with opposite sides. If there was a string connecting the tension rod to the rod directly across it, you would have even force on both sides. Start with half turns, moving all the way around the drum.

, Hit the snare right in front of each rod. More likely than not, the sound is a little different at each one. Use your drum key to tune the rods so that they all sound the same when hit.


Tightening the rod will make it sound higher pitched. Loosening it will make it a bit deeper.
If you have a percussion keyboard or piano, you can listen directly to pitch to make this easier. You want the head to be between G and B-flat., Is it tight enough for you, or do you want a little more splash? For crisper, tighter sounds you want a tighter head. For more resonant, slightly deeper sounds you want a slightly lighter head. If you're going to adjust the rods again, make sure you remember to work in opposite pairs, and only turn each rod 1/4 turn at a time.


You'll get more stick bounce with a tighter head.
You should re-test the drum at each rod when done to make sure the tone is even.

, Once you've got the drum tuned to your liking, you're ready to put the snares back on and start playing. Make sure that the snare wires are evenly applied. They should be in a straight line through the middle of the drum, not diagonal., Drum tuning is not to a key, like a melody instrument. While you can clearly tell an untuned snare by its muddy, ringing tone, there are a lot of different sounds you can get out of a tuned drum, depending on your needs. You can tune it extra tight for a high pitched, sharp ""snap,"" or you can keep it a bit looser to create a more resonant sound. The key is to test the drum regularly, hitting it often to find the sound your want.


Drum tone is largely subjective. Keep playing and tuning yourself and you'll find out what you like and don't like.
Don't tune your drum with the wires hooked up, or microphones attached. You need to hear the drum cleanly and crisply."

Make sure your hi-hats are appropriately positioned in the kit.,

You may want to review How to Set Up a Drum Kit to do this properly.

, Do this by either holding down the pedal with your left foot or locking the top cymbal down using the wing nut.

, In many basic rock grooves, the hi-hats are usually struck on every quarter, eighth or sixteenth note. If you already have a feel for ""closed"" hi-hat use, learn how to start using the hi-hat pedal.

,;
, If your foot is on the pedal holding the cymbals together, lift it up so the cymbals are not touching each other.

,


One exercise is the ""heal-toe"" - starting with an open hi-hat and your toe pointed up, bring your toe down to close the hi-hat. Simultaneously, point your heel up. Then, switch again. After practicing this rhythmically for a minute or two, the muscles in your lower leg will start to burn. You will soon be able to do this for longer and longer, becoming more efficient in using the hi-hat pedal for long time periods.

, This is to further the two cymbals from each other that they make more of a ""sizzling"" sound when struck. Playing traditional rock grooves with a looser hi-hat gives more of a metal feel.

, As timekeeping is a primary function of the hi-hats, you should practice ""clicking"" or ""snapping"" the hats together on beat. This is usually done on each of the quarter notes (1-2-3-4) or every other eighth note (the ""ands"" - 1-&-2-&-3-&-4-&.)

, Since you're using the pedal, play the normal hi-hat part on the ride cymbal, floor tom, cowbell, or another part of the drum kit.

, Hold the cymbals tight with the pedal, open the hats, quickly (almost simultaneously) strike the top cymbal, and immediately close the hats with the pedal again. This technique is often applied in hip hop, blues, and motown-like genres.

First, you will have to know how to read bass clef music.,
Sit on a spinning stool in front of however many timpani you need to play.,
Make sure you have timpani mallets.,
To tune a timpani, you will need a pitch pipe, or if there is a vibraphone nearby, it will work just as well because its keys will not go out of tune.,
Read the music just as you would any other music, making sure that you are playing the right drums at the right time, depending on where they are located in front of you and where the notes are located on the staff.

",How to Play the Timpani," The spaces on the staff, going from bottom to top are: A, C, E, G (acronym- All Cars Eat Gas). The lines going from bottom to top are: G, B, D, F, A (Glad Bags Don't Fall Apart).;
, They should be arranged in a semi circle around you so that they are easy to reach. Make sure the timpani are almost (but not) touching and that you don't need to pull your elbow out or in to reach any of the drums.

, There are different ones for the different sound you want to get out of the timpani. Some people use a French grip which is like matched grip for snare, except the wrists are turned so that the thumbs are pointed upward. You can also grip the mallets like you would with matched grip. Either is correct.

, Before you begin tuning, move the pedal as far down as it will go so the timpani plays the lowest possible note. Gradually increase the pitch by pushing the pedal forwards. If you go past the desired pitch, start back at the lowest note again. Make sure that, when checking the music to see what notes you will be playing, the higher note will go on the smaller drum and the lower note will go on the bigger drum. The drums should also be arranged largest to smallest because this makes the music much more easier to read.

Carpet (if you don't already have one of these, it will make your life much, much easier by preventing your drums from moving, and giving you the ability to mark on the carpet where everything goes), bass drum and kick pedal, throne, snare, mounted toms, floor toms, cymbals.,
Next, extend the legs on your bass drum spurs so that the front hoop is about an inch off the ground, placing the drum with the spurs 4–6 inches (10.2–15.2 cm) from the outer edge of the carpet or drum riser.,
Attach the bass drum pedal - and slave pedal if you play double kick.,
Your snare should be set relatively flat, placed right between your legs, and high enough that your hands don't bang into your thighs when you rim shot (don't re-read that sentence too many times).

,
Your mounted toms (any number is acceptable, but typically you'll have 1,2, or 3 mounted toms.),
Your floor tom should be next to your bass drum leg, opposite your snare with approximately the same height and angle as the snare.,
If you play a double pedal, place your hi-hat stand right next to the slave pedal, and you should find that it's already in a comfortable place for you.,
Your crash cymbal is usually placed in between the 1st mounted tom and the hi-hat.,
The ride cymbal is generally placed over the floor tom.,
Just keep in mind the idea of ""ergonomics when placing the ride.",How to Position Your Drums for Ultimate Comfort," Start by laying down your rug.;
, (If you're on a gig, the sound engineer will, no doubt, be grateful you left room for a microphone!)

, Take into consideration how tall you are. If you're on the shorter side, you might find that your throne is as low as it will go - hopefully that's low enough. On the other hand, if you're over 6 feet (1.8 m), you probably don't want to have your throne all the way down. It should be set high enough that when seated, your hips are 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) above your knees. Make sure that you are close enough to the foot pedals so that your knee rests almost directly over your ankle. This will provide you with the most power and control.

,, should be suspended over the bass drum between the hi-hat and ride cymbal. Your maneuverability with these is dependent on the depth of the toms, height of the bass drum, and type of mounts you have. If there is a center post mounting them to the bass drum, your range of motion will be relatively limited. If they are suspended from the cymbal stands you'll have a little bit more mobility, as well as slightly increased sustain with fewer sympathetic vibrations. As a rule of thumb, the angle of your toms should never pass 45 degrees. The only exception to this is if your bass drum is too tall, and/or your toms are too deep to get closer positioning. Personally, I like my mounted toms low and mostly flat, with the rims as close together as possible without touching. This trend in drumming has led to many manufacturers providing much shallower toms than in years passed. The idea behind this is to ensure that your sticks will be able to rebound when they strike the playing surface, and you can move quickly between them. If your toms are tilted too far towards you and you strike the head at greater than 30 to 45 degree angle, the natural rebound off the head is greatly diminished.

, If your floor tom has legs, you can usually gauge the placement by placing the leg furthest from me just to the right of the bass drum, in between the bass drum and ride cymbal stand.

, If it seems too far away, simply bring both pedals in towards you. Make sure your hi hat cymbals are high enough to allow your right hand to strike the snare, yet low enough that you can easily play with the tips of the sticks on the top of the cymbals.

, Again, high enough to ""crash"" the cymbal with the shoulder of the stick, and low enough that you can play with the tip of the stick on top of the cymbal.

, The topic of ride cymbal placement is the subject of much debate as some players like it really low and almost parallel to the ground, or higher up and tilted with the bell toward the player, and everywhere in between.

, Put it somewhere that will be comfortable for you to play on a consistent basis, where you can easily reach the bell, ride on the bow of the cymbal and even crash when necessary.

Place your bass drum on the floor with the head on top.,
Figure out where you want your hole.,
Decide what size you would like.,
Take off the label on the can and place the top edge of the empty can down on an electric stove to heat it up.,
Once your can is hot enough, about 20-30 seconds on high on the electric stove, grab the can with the mitts and slowly place the hot edge on the bass drum head.,
Slowly pull out the can trying not to bump the side of the head as the can may be very hot.",How to Port a Hole in a Bass Drum," The side the beater hits should be closer to the ground.;
, In the center, the beat will be the tightest as the air can escape the drum faster this way. Placing it off to the side gives more of a fatter sound; it depends on what you desire.

, 3–6 inches (7.6–15.2 cm) is recommended. Find a metal can with the same diameter (any can will work, soup, coffee, etc.).

, If you have a gas stove, try using a torch to heat up the edge of the can (this is far more dangerous and is not really recommended). You will have to get oven mitts to hold the can to prevent burning of your fingers as the can will get a bit hot.

, If your can is hot enough, it will cut through your head like butter leaving a nice even edge on the head.

, The circle piece you just cut should be somewhere in the bass drum; pull it out and throw it away.

Be professional.,
Play with other musicians at every opportunity.,
Develop your own style.",How to Play the Drums Like a Pro1," If you don't practice then you'll never be good. It takes a lot of hard work.;
, Many drummers will tell you that they are self-taught. This leads some drummers to think that lessons are not necessary and they'll often avoid it altogether. We're here to tell you that, without a firm foundation, you could pick up some real bad habits that may take you years to ""unlearn"". Find a reputable, qualified teacher and study the foundation of drumming before you do anything else. Make sure you know how to read music and that you know the different styles of drumming.

, Remember that a drum kit is as good as the person playing it. A fantastic drum kit tuned and played by a beginner will sound awful, whereas a cheap no name drum kit that is tuned and played by a seasoned drummer can actually sound wonderful. That being said, sturdy hardware is no unnecessary luxury. Get a drum throne that suits your height and supports your weight, and that you can keep proper balance on. Make sure your pedals rum smoothly. And last but not least, make sure your drums and cymbals are stable on their stands.

, There is an old saying; ""Out of Sight, Out of Mind"" and it is one of the truest things ever written. You can be one of the best but if no one sees you play, you can't possibly get hired. Learn marketing techniques and get out in front. Make sure everyone in town knows who you are. Sit in on jam sessions and hand out business cards. Leave no stone unturned.

, One thing weightlifters understand is that progress in building a muscle really starts when you push past that point where you want to quit. The same goes for drumming too. If you'll really dedicate yourself and practice diligently, you will see a remarkable difference in your playing. Go the extra mile and don't settle for mediocrity.

, Warm up before every gig, play for the music (not for yourself), be on time, and act professionally. Your reputation will determine how much you work. If you don't take yourself seriously, other musicians won't take you seriously.

, You will learn much more playing in bands than practicing in your bedroom. Never turn down a gig and always be willing to play unfamiliar styles of music.

, You won't know what your style is if you only copy beats, and once you join a band you can't copy beats for your own music. Never double book yourself and if you really have to cancel a gig, make sure you recommend a reliable dep to fill in.

, Don't be stubborn about how awesome you are. Take his advice instead. Listen to what you can really take away and use to improve your playing.

, He's probably right. He's just trying to get you up to speed with everyone else. Remember that you want to learn to work together with other band members, even if it means you have to adjust your style a bit.

, Be sensitive to the environment you are playing in, if it's a small room you need to adapt or play quieter, in a large venue you may need to play a bit louder., Set yourself at least 10 different volumes of playing. You can say to your bandleader would you like 1 - 10.

Strike the drum with different intensities.",How to Play the Djembe," You should do this before even touching your drum.Go for a short walk or run in place.
Do yoga or tai chi to get grounded into your body before you play.
Drumming is both a physical and mental exercise, so its important to be prepared.;
, If the skin is too loose or too tight, the drum won't produce the right sound.
You can tune the drum by tightening or loosening the tuning ropes on the side of the drum.
It is a good idea to use gloves and a rope puller to help you do this.
Have a friend help you tune the drum.

, You can play the drum standing up, with it placed under your arm. ,


Some djembe players use a strap that goes over the shoulders, keeping the drum in place between their knees.
Adjust the strap so the drum is sitting at a 90 degree angle with your arms for proper playing. The forearms should form a straight line from fingertips to elbow.
Keep a good posture, and keep the drum as steady as possible while playing.

, You can also play the djembe sitting down. Tilt your drum slightly away from you and place your arms laterally away from your torso, about 6-8 inches.
Your hands should rest comfortably on the head of the drum at a 90 degree angle. Your forearms should form a straight line from fingertip to elbow.
You may need to experiment with different chairs or stools to get one at the proper height for your drum. You can also purchase an adjustable stool.

, They can do this either on a conga, or simply on a table or hard surface.


Keep the beat slow to start with until you get used to how to play the djembe.
Cup one or both hands, depending on the position of your drum.
Play a rhythm keeping in time with the beat. Repeat this rhythm over and over again until you are familiar with the rhythm.
Change rhythm and keep same beat.

, Most djembe patterns will be played like this. This means that if you fill every note in measure, your hands would alternate left and right.
In 4/4 time (4 beats per measure), this means that the downbeat and the ""+"" beat are played with the right hand. The offbeats are played with the left hand.

, The type of stroke you use can affect how the drum resonates.


Each stroke can either be open or closed. (let your hand bounce freely off the drum) or closed (press your hand down so that it doesn't bounce of the drum).
Open strokes are made when you let your hand bounce freely off the drum.
Closed strokes are made when you press your hand down so that it doesn't bounce off of the drum.
Open strokes will make the drum resonate more and closed strokes will make it resonate less.

, As soon as your palm hits the drum, let it bounce off like you are bouncing on a trampoline.
The the open tone is made by striking with your knuckles approximately over the rim.
The slap is done with the heel of your palm in the center of the drum head and your fingers slapping near the far rim. As soon as your fingertips hit the drum head they should rebound like the tip of a bullwhip.
The slapping stroke is the hardest to get---- practice making the slap as high-pitched as possible.

, This will vary the volume.


Accent some beats and de-emphasize others.
This will add variety to your sound.
Experiment with different intensities and different tones at different rhythms.

,
Stay with it!",How to Warm Up Before Playing the Trumpet," Make sure you always sit up straight in your chair and place your feet flat on the floor. This is for breathing; you cannot get a good breath in if you are hunched over because your lungs cannot expand properly.;
, When you take a breath, focus on trying to push your stomach out as far as you can rather than your chest. We breathe primarily using our diaphragms rather than the muscles in our chest, and breathing in this manner maximizes the use of our diaphragm muscles.

,, Never halfheartedly practice anything, in order to improve you must ALWAYS practice as if you are playing in front of 1000 people. This is the only way you will improve, you must internalize diligence. This includes warming up.

, Many professionals believe that this is the best way to internalize a good sound as well as articulation and pitch because the trumpet is essentially a large amplifier for the mouthpiece. It is much more difficult to make be accurate and have a good sound on the mouthpiece than trumpet, so all the exercises you do to warm up should first be buzzed on the mouthpiece and then transferred to the trumpet.

, I like to first start by playing our G in the staff as softly as possible and then crescendo all the way up to as loud as I can possibly play and then back down. This should be done over about 15 seconds time. It is VERY IMPORTANT that you do not let your pitch dip when you get louder, this is what the exercise is for. Only play as loudly as you can play with a good tone, but play as softly as possible regardless. Do this with multiple different open notes.

, GREAT exercise for loosening those stiff lip muscles up (I don't know a single pro that doesn't warm up this way at some point). Hold G in the staff for a whole note, then slur down to C for a whole note. Next, go to F sharp in the staff for a whole note, slur to low B for a whole note etc. Do this down until D and then reverse direction. Also do this from C in the staff down to G etc. Slurs should be SLOW at first, but then eventually try to speed them up so that each note is a quarter note and then eventually an eight note to increase flexibility.

, These are hard to describe without being able to show you the music but the exercises in them are great for getting your fingers and lips moving together. I would get all three, especially the Clarke and the Arban. They are together (well, ok, mostly the Arban) considered the two bibles of the trumpet player!

,, I know at least for me that warming can be really frustrating some days because I just don't sound like I want myself to immediately and can't play as well as I normally can at first. This gets better, but you have to warm up for it to happen so have a little patience and you'll get there! Hope this article was informative!

Purchase a chromatic tuner.,
Make a list of notes that use the third valve slide.,
Confirm your trumpet is in tune.,
Adjust the slide and repeat the notes.,
Play each note that uses the third valve slide.,
Tune each note that uses a third valve slide.",How to Use a Third Valve Slide on Trumpet1," These devices can range in price from $10 to $100 or more. A tuner and metronome combination is a great investment for a new musician. Steer clear of tuners that are crafted specifically for guitars or other instruments. Instead, look for chromatic tuners that can be used to tune any instrument.Start by using a tuner to understand what your trumpet should sound like, when perfectly in tune. As you practice, start learning to adjust your pitch to that of other musicians as this is more important than being the only player in a band “correctly” in tune.;
, Before you get started tuning, you’ll need to make a short list of notes that require the use of the third valve slide for tuning. Essentially, any note played using the third valve may need to be tuned with the third valve slide. The low D and low G played with the 1st and 3rd valves almost always need to be played using the third valve slide to tune. Low C# and low F# played with the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd valves may also need to be tuned with the third valve slide.


D and C# should almost always be played using the third valve slide to keep the trumpet in tune. They should receive the majority of attention, when you’re first learning to use the slide for tuning.
In many cases the low F# and low G are so low they do not need to be tuned using the third valve slide., Once you have a tuner, the first step is to ensure your trumpet’s tone is on pitch using the main tuning slide. The tuning note for trumpets is the C on the scale. It’s recommended that players slur up to the C by playing the first four notes of a G major scale, G, A, B, C. Once the C is reached, the player is truly playing to the pitch of the instrument and not trying to hold the note in tune., If your instrument is sharp, pull the tuning slide out. It it is flat, push the tuning slide in. Continue this process until you can play the C in tune three times in a row. For best results, play a few other notes to see if they're in tune. If not, go back to the C, and make sure you're holding this note in tune. If your C is in tune, but other notes are not, you may have a concern with your instrument. Take it in to a repair shop to be examined., Once your trumpet is in tune overall, it’s time to play your C, G, F#, and C# to see if they are in tune. Start by playing and holding each note in turn to determine whether the note plays in tune already or, if you will need to use the third valve slide to keep the note in tune. Play and hold each note three or four times, and note whether the sharpness or flatness fluctuates without adjusting the third valve slide., Play each note that is not on pitch in your initial test again. This time, repeat the note with the third valve slide extended. Move the slide back and forth until your note is in tune. Repeat this process for each note. Then, start over again playing each note until you extend the third valve slide to the right location to tune your note at least three times in a row.


Over time, your embouchure will go through changes and this will affect your tuning, so you’ll need to repeat this process every few weeks."
"
Play the scale for each note that requires a third valve slide.,
Practice one scale per day.,
Check that the note is in tune each time you play it.,
Repeat this process.",How to Use a Third Valve Slide on Trumpet2," This helps you to hear the pitch as it relates to other notes. Listen carefully, and hold each note. If it helps you to hear the intervals, go back and forth between notes. Repeat the scale over and over listening to the interval between each note checking that you’re in tune, and using your third valve slide as necessary., That way you don’t get confused about how far to extend the slide for each note. Repeat the same scale to get used to the way it feels to play the note in tune using your third valve slide.


Don’t rush yourself. Allow as much time as is necessary to learn each note.
Even if it’s difficult while learning trumpet playing, use the third valve slide from the very beginning. It may be more cumbersome and lead to additional errors at the start, but in the long run, it will make playing the trumpet easier., As you practice the note at home, make sure that every time you play it, you’re staying in tune. Your embouchure can and will change over time, especially if you’re a new trumpeter. It’s essential that you keep checking and rechecking your tuning., Once a month or maybe every other month after you’ve gained some trumpet playing experience, check that you’re still playing in tune by playing the scales and making sure your third valve notes are in tune using a tuner. If you notice a consistent change, adjust your third valve slide, and practice the new position until it seems natural."
"
Use slide oil or grease regularly.,
Use a snake to clean buildup each week.,
Clear water from the third valve slide.,
Wash your trumpet weekly.,
Clean each smaller part of the trumpet.,
Avoid eating or drinking before playing the trumpet.",How to Use a Third Valve Slide on Trumpet3," In order to move the third valve slide as quickly as is necessary to continue from note to note, especially with 8th or 16th notes, you’ll need to keep the slide slick. For “slow” slides, like the main tuning slide, that remain stationary during play, grease is typically recommended. However, for the “fast” third and first valve slides, you may want to use oil instead.


Oil is lighter, and it allows your valves to move more quickly.
Slide grease can become sticky over time making it more difficult to move slides to quickly tune shorter notes., Snakes consist of two brushes on either end of a long chord that is typically made of metal. Remove the valve from the trumpet, and push one end of the snake through the opening at one end of the valve. Gently push the brush all the way through the u-bend and out the other side of the valve. Pull the other end of the brush through the valve.


Every part of the trumpet collects spit, debris, and bacteria from the mouth, and requires regular cleaning to maintain optimal function. The bends in the instrument make it easy for buildup to collect.
In order to keep the tiny u-bend in the third valve slide clear, use a snake to clean it at least once a week. , As you play, you may notice a gurgling or bubbling noise. When this occurs, you likely have spit trapped in one of your valves. Most trumpets and cornets come equipped with water keys or “spit valves.” To clear the third valve water key, press down on the third valve, open the water key, and blow into the trumpet. Water will be released from the key.


If the gurgling sound continues, empty your tuning slide water key by pushing down all three valves, holding open the water key, and blowing., You’ll need to completely clean your trumpet, especially if you’re practicing for at least an hour a day as is advised. Fill a bathtub with warm water. Remove all of the valves, caps, and slides from the trumpet, and place the body of the trumpet in water. Let the main portion of the trumpet soak for about half an hour. In the meant time you should carefully clean, oil, and grease your valves and slides as necessary.


Remove your trumpet from the bath, and allow it to dry for half an hour.
Then, use a cleaning rod covered in a cleaning cloth to remove excess moisture inside the valves, slides, and bell of the trumpet., Use sterile gauze or a cleaning cloth to remove moisture from pistons and their caps. Use a snake to remove moisture from all slides: first, third, and the two main tuning slides. Oil the pistons and the first and third slide, and grease the two tuning slides.

, Apart from water, avoid consumption of any food or beverage that might introduce sugars and other foreign debris to your trumpet. This may lead to a build up that causes the growth of mold or bacteria. These sugars also cause valves and slides to get sticky, impeding fluid motion."

Start off with a decent beginner trumpet from a reputable brand, preferably made of brass with a lacquer finish.,
Decide if you're ready for a new trumpet.,
Determine what level of trumpet to buy.,
Play with your sound a bit.,
Check your budget.,
Do research.,
Test trumpets.",How to Select a Good Trumpet," Silver plating is much too expensive for a beginning instrument.;
, If you have been playing for 2 or 3 years on the same horn and have improved then, yes, you may be ready for a new trumpet, especially if your instrument is a basic or student trumpet. If you haven't been playing for that long, and there is very little need for you to purchase a new trumpet, hold off for a little while.

, An intermediate trumpet will usually have more resistance in the upper register to prevent the player from over-blowing and ruining his/her chops. A professional instrument, depending on the model, will have little to no resistance, but will cost you a good bit more.

, If your sound is really bright and brassy, then you may want to purchase a cornet, a large bore trumpet, or a Ring Mute. These two offer a darker sound. However, if you manage to produce a darker sound, which is hard to do without practice, you might want to start out on a small bore Yamaha, or a King.

, Trumpets are expensive- the most expensive ones can easily run into five digits. Most step-up trumpets, though, are around one or two thousand dollars. That it still a lot of money, so be sure you can afford a new trumpet. If you can't afford the two thousand, but desperately need another trumpet, try looking for a used horn for sale. Many trumpet players, upon buying a new horn, no longer want or need their old one, and will sell it for a large discount with very minor wear.

, Learn about what particular types of trumpet are considered better by the trumpet-playing community. Many Kings, for example, are considered next to useless, although they may catch your eye for having large designs of roses etched into the bell. The Bach Stradivarius, meanwhile, looks rather bland, but is considered a very good quality horn for its cost. (A bit over two thousand in most cases.)

, Go to the local music store, and not-so-local ones, and test all the trumpets they have. You don't want to make a bad decision, so give yourself as many options as possible. Test as many trumpets as possible. You should be able to test trumpets before you buy them at your local credible music shop. If you're not allowed to, don't give them your business. You might want to get a reliable worker at the store to help you out. Decide which horn has the least pressure and resistance when you play in the upper register.

Though larger bongos will likely sound tempting, it's best for beginners to start out with something small. Think about your first driving experience – would you rather start with a bicycle or a semi-truck? This way, you get down the basic techniques before worrying about all the notes you want to produce.;
, The material the bongos are made from can entirely change the sound, length of the note, and timbre from one bongo to another. Since bongos come from all over the place, there are many materials that they can be made out of. Try out a few before your settle with one.


Most bongo shells are made of wood, but some are also available in fiberglass or metal. The heads, while normally made from rawhide, are also available in some synthetic materials. It's all a matter of personal preference and need.

, A pair of bongos can range anywhere from $50 to $450. All of them have different personalities and all of them have different sounds. Before your set your sights on one, be sure to give a few a try. You may be surprised.


If you plan on playing more often than annoying your friends at the occasional party, it's a good idea to invest in a decent pair. When it comes to bongos, you often get what you pay for.

, You should sit on a comfortable chair with no arms. A simple dining chair is good. You don't want a chair you sink into that can disrupt your posture and arms will just get in the way.


The chair should also be a good height but not too high. You need to be able to put your legs comfortably so that they can reach the floor. Many bongo players find there knees going up and down with the beat – the advanced ones might even play the foot tambourine – both of which require the floor.

, Position yourself at the edge of the seat and make sure your legs are at a 90 degree angle. It'll be much easier to hold the bongos if the seat isn't in the way and your legs are in a good position to support them.

, That is, if you're right handed. If you're left handed, switch it. Put the large drum (hembra/female drum) on your right knee. Hold the drum firmly in place with both legs. Make sure you feel comfortable - you might need to readjust.


If for some reason you are unable to sit or find it uncomfortable, there are stands specifically designed for mounting bongos or set-ups that combine them in with a larger drum set.

, This is sort of different from the beat. This is what you feel viscerally when you listen to music. That pulse you sway to when you're dancing or how you move your head when music starts playing. It's usually very basic. Put on some music you can play the bongos to and feel this pulse. It'll help you find what beats you want to add in with your bongos.


You'll likely find, if you're sitting with your bongos, that your leg or legs moves up and down with this pulse. In fact, keep doing that. It'll help you stay in time.

, That should be the smaller drum, the male drum. Stick to the pulse right now – just a basic 1, 2, 3, 4 or whatever time signature matches your music.


This is called a “tone.” It should be one clear pitch and is on the edge of the drum closest to you. This one is on the downbeat and is the skeleton of the beat you will be creating.

, As you're tapping out the basic pulse, be sure you're tapping with the top ⅔ of your fingers. Just lightly, not using a lot of force. Your fingers should come up from the drum after you strike it to remove the possibility of tainting the note.


Avoid using the rim right now, and stick to playing the head of the drum. Your fingers should be resting on the edge of the head nearest you.

, This will be on the offbeat. While you're playing 1, 2, 3, 4 with your left hand, turn to the bigger drum, the female drum, and play between beats 2 and 3 and beats 4 and 1. In other words, with your two hands, you'll be playing 1, 2, and, 3, 4, and.


Play the edge of the right drum just like you were playing the edge of the left drum. Use the top ⅔ of your fingers and stick to a light touch. Avoid the rim for now.

, You've got the basic stroke down. Now it's time to learn about a few more. For the record, the open tone stroke is what we just covered.



Open tone stroke. To get a nice, clear, open tone, hit the edge of the drum with the knuckled part of your palm, letting your fingers bounce off the head (the main part of the drum). Try moving your fingers back and forth, about 4 inches (10 cm) in from the center of the drum, and notice how the sound changes. You want a rich, clear sound that has a definite note. Overtones (those annoying ringing sounds that get in the way of a clear tone) are not part of an open tone.

Slap. Instead of having your hand fully relaxed, cup your fingers slightly as you hit the head of the drum to create an accent (louder) note. This will add color and flair to your drumming. After your hand makes contact with the drum, relax your fingers, allowing them to bounce off the head. This makes a popping sound of a higher pitch than the above stroke.

Heel-tip movement. Rest your hand on the head of the drum. Switch between using the heel of your palm and the tip of your fingers, rocking back and forth. Be sure to always keep your hand in contact with the head of the drum when you're doing this stroke.

Basic muted tone. This one is just like the open tone, but after you strike it, you leave your fingers to rest on the head. For this one, it's important to keep your hands relaxed and barely moving. All you should really hear with this tone is a very light sound, the sound of the light touch of your fingers against the head.

, As you get into playing the bongos, you'll be using the rim of the drums, using one hand on both drums, and getting into eighth and sixteenth notes – in other words, you're hands will practically be flying. Once you get used to a basic beat, try to make it more difficult by adding accent beats or switching up the type of stroke you're using.


Try not to bite off more than you can chew, otherwise you risk getting demotivated. No one can walk before they can run, and while the bongos may look incredibly simple to play, to get them to sound musical and varied takes true skill. Practice every day to work on your abilities.

, Here's the good news: the beats you were just playing in the above section were the basic Habanera – you just have to add in one more movement. Here's how it works:


Keep the pulse with your left hand on the small drum. 1, 2, 3, 4.
Then, add in offbeats after 2 and 4 on the big drum with your right hand. 1, 2, and, 3, 4, and.
And then, add in offbeats after 1 and 3 on the small drum with your right hand. This changes the note and gives the beats a more musical sound. 1, and, 2, and, 3, and, 4, and.

, Get used to the bongo pattern of the ""hammer,"" or martillo – it's the basic beat of the salsa and many types of bongo music. Here's how it's done:


Use the index finger of your right hand to get the beat going on the rim of the small drum. This is beats 1, 2, and 3.
Using the small drum again, use the fingers of your left hand to do the ""and"" beat after 1 and 3. For the ""and"" after 2 and 4, use your left thumb.
Use an open tone on beat 4 with the fingers of your right hand on the right drum. Open out into as fast a pattern as you can follow without error.

, This rhythm changes between tones and touches. You know tones – played on the edge of the drum head, one definite note – but then there are touches: just a light tap on the middle of the drum head with your fingers, mainly to keep time. It's pretty simple:


Start on the left drum with both of your hands. Do tones with 1, and, 3, and. Do touches with 2, and, 4, and. Tone, tone, touch, touch, tone, tone, touch, touch.
Once you have that down, instead of ""4 and"" as two touches, do beat 4 (no and) on the right drum as a tone. Pause where the and would be. Now, you have tone, tone, touch, touch, tone, tone, (big drum) tone.
Your hands should have a very rhythmic, rocking back and forth motion as they vary between tones and touches.

, This one will be the most difficult rhythm we discuss, but it's still totally doable. It's just another mixture of tones and touches. What's more, it's right, left, right, left, just like walking, apart from the very first two beats. It's rhythm is one-and-a-two-and-a-three-and-a-four. Here's how it's done:


Start with beat 1 as a bass stroke on the left drum – in other words, hit the edge of the drum furthest away from you.
The first ""and a"" is a light touch with your right and then left hand on the left drum. Beat 2 is a tone with your right hand also on the left drum. The second ""and a"" are light touches with your left then right also on the left drum.
Beat 3 is a tone on the right drum with your right hand. ""And"" is a touch on the left drum with your left hand. ""A four"" is a light touch on the left drum, followed by a tone on the left drum with your right hand.

,,, You can do this by turning on the faucet and running warm water down the bell, this will get lose particles out, and make the lead tubing easier to clean with the snake later.

,, You must make sure to remember the order of your valves if they don't have numbers on them. This is very important, so check to see if all of the valves have numbers on them saying 1,2, and 3 before mixing them up. Now some of the valves might have S1, S2 and S3 written on them so please keep then in order. If they don't, just set them aside (In order).

,, Take a washcloth and clean the mouthpiece out with some soap. Also, if you own a mouthpiece brush, you should run it through your mouthpiece to get all the gunk out of inside of it.

,,, Do not put the top part of the valve in the water because of the felt at the top can get ruined. Run your mouthpiece brush through all of the 3 holes in the valve, making sure to get all buildup out. Repeat with other valves.

Slur up to the high notes.,
Play chromatic scales.,
Practice octave jumps.,
Learn lip vibrato.,
Combine octave jumps and lip vibrato.",How to Screech On a Trumpet1," This is the change of pitch using just your mouth position and changes in airspeed without tonguing. Practicing some basic lip slurs is a great way to hit high notes using just the speed of air flow rather than relying on mouthpiece pressure or tensing up to hit the notes. Instead, slurring up to higher and higher notes allows you to more naturally extend your range.Something as simple as slurring a chromatic scale will work just fine, but there are also a number of lip slur exercises available specifically for extending range.
You can use these popular Maurice Andre lip slur exercises to get started, and these are available free of charge online..;
, Whether you’re using them to practice your lip slurs or as a warm up, it’s important to play chromatic scales on a regular basis. Chromatic scales help you learn a number of important trumpet skills including tuning. They are also an excellent tool for you to learn to play higher notes in tune. Moving up by half steps, you can feel where you begin to strain to reach the notes, and hear when you start to play sharp or flat. Over the course of several weeks, you’ll be able to significantly improve your range just by practicing your chromatic scales.


Play the chromatic scale up to the first note that causes you to strain. Repeat this scale until you can play it easily. Then, move on to the next. This could take a few days or weeks of practicing.
Play the scale a few times at the beginning and end of your practice session to determine whether you can reach the notes when you’re tired. If you can’t, you’re likely relying on pressure to reach the notes instead of air speed.
This method will work to help you play lower notes as well., Playing the chromatic scale allows players to hear each note and how they build to higher notes. Jumping up and down octaves allows you to build muscle memory in your lips and learn how it feels to play specific notes. This can help you play higher notes in tune, since you’ll have just played the same note in a range you’re more comfortable with. Octave jumps are essential to a really impressive trumpet screech. The comparison to the lower note makes the high note sound even higher. Practice jumps of an octave or more to make your high notes scream., This technique gives the screech its raw, jazzy feeling. Lip vibrato is not just moving the trumpet. Instead, this is a more subtle, slight vibration of the lips that should produce a result similar to using a whammy bar while playing guitar. Once you hit the note you want to hold, simply loosen your lips slightly, and allow the fast burst of air to make them vibrate.

, To really scream you need to jump from a low note to a high note. Then, while holding your high note, perform a lip vibrato to create the unique screeching or howling quality. Some of the greatest trumpet players are famous for their ability to do this well, but it does take practice. You’ll likely sound a little strange at first, so choose a practice location where you won’t be disturbing anyone.

Learn double tonguing before learning triple tonguing.,

Understand when to use the triple tongue technique.,^ Triple Tonguing in the most popular form uses the syllables as Ta-Ta-Ka, or another popular method is Ta-Ka-Ta.,
Learn the Ta syllable.,
Learn the Ka syllable.,
Group the syllables together.,
Vocalize the syllables in a different order.,

Play on the mouthpiece.,

Switch notes during triplets.,
Practice.",How to Triple Tongue on the Trumpet,"  Triple tonguing is similar in that it uses the same syllables as double tonguing so it is recommended to learn double tonguing first.
, Triple tonguing is used when a wind musician is required to play a fast passage that is in groups of three. The triple tongue technique uses the same syllables as the double tongue technique: Ta-Ka, Da-Ga, Tu-Ku. The difference between triple tonguing and double tonguing is the way the syllables are used. When you triple tongue, you tongue at the front of your mouth twice, and the back once.,, Practice the Ta sound by saying the word “toddler” (other hard T words may be used). Notice where your tongue is when saying the word. Other variations on this syllable are Da or Tu., Practice the Ka sound by saying the word “Cup” (this sets up the tongue where is should be when you triple tongue). Other variations of this syllable are Ga or Ku., Slowly say the syllables in the form Ta-Ta-Ka. Be sure you are clearly articulating each syllable, and each syllable is the same length. Gradually pick up the tempo to the point where you are able to say a group of three syllables (Ta-Ta-Ka) at 100 beats per minute on a metronome.

, Following the chart above, vocalize these groups of three. Repeat each line on its own, as its own exercise several times. This will help you become very comfortable with the syllables. T represents a Ta, and K represents a Ka.

, Begin on a mid-ranged note, between a low E and middle G. Play a long tone and slowly move your tongue to the Ta-Ta-Ka (or Ta-Ka-Ta) syllables. As this is the first time triple tonguing with your embouchure, begin slow and speed up with the metronome., Use the same exercise that was used on the mouthpiece. Holding out a single mid ranged long note and adding in the groups of three syllables, gradually picking up the tempo., Practice the above exercise in multiple keys above and below. This exercise helps you work on your triple tonguing technique in the full range of the instrument.

, Follow this exercise again in multiple keys. This exercise begins to change notes. This is the beginning of learning the coordination between your fingers and tongue.

, Practice this exercise. Playing a chromatic scale, where you switch notes every time you articulate. This takes lots of practice to line up the articulation with when your fingers change notes. Practice this exercise in many keys, changing the range.





, Being a musician, practice is key to success. Practicing these exercises will help build up the speed and endurance of your triple tongue. Even very advanced musicians practice triple tonguing to maintain his or her skill."
"
Do breathing exercises.,
Strengthen your lip muscles.,
Improve your embouchure.,
Avoid pressing your mouthpiece.,
Relax your throat and stomach muscles.",How to Screech On a Trumpet2," Many people confuse increasing air pressure with increasing the speed of air. Blowing harder will increase the volume of sound, but it will not raise the pitch. High notes require moving air into the mouthpiece more quickly. Practice breathing in deeply, and slowly exhaling pushing all of the air from your lungs. Then, inhale deeply. Hold your breath. After a few seconds, release a short burst of air. Continue these short, fast puffs until you push all the air from your lungs. Now, alternate between the slow, gradual exhales and short, quick bursts., One of the most commonly used methods is to hold a pencil with your lips. Place a pencil in your mouth with the eraser resting on your tongue. Close your lips around the pencil to hold it in place. Don’t use your teeth or tongue to support the weight of the pencil. Time yourself and hold the pencil in place for ten seconds. Rest for ten seconds and repeat. When this seems easy, increase to twenty seconds., The way you hold your lips matters. Once you’ve established a basic technique, a few adjustments will make it easier to hit the high notes. The Stevens embouchure is commonly referred to as the “scream” embouchure. In this method, you roll either the upper or lower lip under rather than puckering your lips. In the traditional method, lips are pressed together, but in the Stevens method, one lip is rolled under the other creating a seal. This makes it more difficult for air to split your lips apart, so you’ll be able to reach the higher notes more easily.


Try the method by rolling your lower lip under your upper lip. Then, switch and roll your upper lip under your lower. Practice both until it becomes clear which is more comfortable for you.
When playing low and midrange notes using the Stevens embouchure, these notes may sound brighter. Pay close attention and adjust your embouchure to fit the music., One way that young trumpet players reach high notes is by clenching their instrument tighter to their lips. While this may work once or twice, you will not be able to play these notes consistently or in tune. Pay attention and try not to press your mouthpiece harder to achieve your high notes., Visualize what would happen if you surrounded a basketball with concrete. The air content would remain the same, but you wouldn’t be unable to dribble the ball or shoot a basket. Tensing your stomach muscles works in much the same way. The same amount of air remains in your lungs, but it’s unable to move through your body freely. Additionally, when most people tense their stomach muscles, their throats constrict, further limiting airflow."
"
Sit or stand with the correct posture.,
Take time to warm up completely.,
Tune your instrument.,
Designate ten percent of practice to range extension.,
Learn to play midrange notes effortlessly.,
Change your mouthpiece.",How to Screech On a Trumpet3," By keeping your back straight and gluteus muscles tensed, you’ll be able to control the movement of air through your lungs and into the mouthpiece. Adjust your posture as necessary to allow your lungs to fill fully with air. Relax your core and rely on your lungs to provide the necessary breath support., Warming up before a run stretches muscles and prevents soreness, and your trumpet warm up performs the same function. Play a number of long, low tones. Gradually, work your way up the scale playing notes and holding them. Once your lips are warm, move on to playing scales quickly. Slur up and tongue down. Accelerate your tempo as your repeat the scale to begin warming up your fingers as well., Once you’re warm, use a chromatic tuner to make sure your C on the staff, the traditional trumpet tuning note, is on pitch. If you’re playing with a group, tune to one instrument to ensure the ensemble sounds good together. If your instrument is sharp, move the tuning slide in. If your instrument is flat, push the tuning slide out. Repeat the tuning C, until you’re able to play in tune at least three times in a row., If you practice for an hour each day, only six minutes of your practice should focus on reaching higher notes. This may seem like a relatively small amount, but the easier your low and mid register notes are to hit, the simpler your high notes will be. Improve your overall skill, and your high range will improve with it., This makes high notes easier. A good rule of thumb is that however difficult a C on the scale is to play a C above the scale will be twice as hard. Thus, the easier it is to play a tuning C, the easier it will be to play your high C., Once you’ve developed your skill using a beginners or deep mouthpiece, you may want to switch to a more shallow option. While it may be tempting to depend on a shallow mouthpiece to help you play higher notes from the beginning, it’s essential that you learn to rely on your embouchure combined with the speed of air to hit high notes rather than your mouthpiece. However, some mouthpieces can make hitting the right notes easier."

Start with the CAGED system.,
Find popular songs that use the chords you teach.,
Keep your lessons simple.,
Focus on technique over theory.,
Maintain flexibility.,
Emphasize practice between sessions.,
Provide exercises for improving finger strength.",How to Teach Guitar1," The ""CAGED"" system is a set of five simple, open chords that are easy for beginning guitar students to learn. These common chords don't require complex finger movements and appear in a variety of songs.Do a search online, and you can find plenty of free resources to help you get started in this system, including chord charts and teaching tips and tricks.
The CAGED system includes the chords C, A, Am, G, E, Em, D, and Dm. These chords have relatively simple shapes that are easy to learn and transition between. Once your students have these chords down along with a few basic strumming patterns, they should be able to play thousands of songs.
Structure each lesson around a chord or two, and making a simple transition.;
, Many students want to learn how to play guitar so that they can play their favorite songs. Try to pick a variety of songs in different genres so your students can learn something with which they're already familiar.For example, you may want to find a classic rock song and a country or folk song that uses the chords taught in each of your lessons. If you can find several, your students can pick the songs that most appeal to them.
Many songs also have simplified, beginner versions that you can use to motivate your students and make them feel like they're making progress. Seek these out especially for students who mention favorite songs they've always wanted to play. Inspire confidence – don't simply tell them that the song they want to play is ""too hard"" or ""too complex.""
You also can use the recordings of those songs to get your students up to speed. Once they learn the chords and how to transition between chords smoothly, they can practice playing along with the recording.

, A limited number of well-defined targets is much easier for beginning students to understand. If you give them too much with each lesson, they may become overwhelmed and abandon their lessons.Decide early on what level of students you want to teach, and develop methods for teaching students at that level. How you teach beginning students will differ from how you would teach intermediate or advanced students.
If your ultimate goal is to keep students for a long time and have them progress in their musicianship and handling of the instrument, you need to be able to identify when you need to step up your teaching methods to match their progress. This is something you'll learn to pick up intuitively with practice.

, To play any instrument well, a musician must have a handle on both theory and technique. In your first lessons with a beginner, include a light introduction to theory, but work on building their physical capability to play the instrument before you worry too much about it in your lessons.You can briefly explain the theory behind the focus of each lesson (the chords you're teaching, or the strumming pattern being used), but leave it at that unless the student expresses an interest in learning more.
Keep in mind that even if the student is interested, too much technique at first can be overwhelming – especially to an anxious student who just wants to start playing already. At the same time, a good bit of theory may be comforting to students who have been classically trained in another instrument, such as piano or violin, because they can fit the guitar into the musical understanding they already have.

, Particularly if you are giving private lessons to individual students, your curriculum should have flexibility so it can be tailored to each student's personal goals and skill level. Not everyone will learn at the same pace.You may want to create a questionnaire for your students to fill out before their lessons start. Include questions that will allow you to learn each student's general musical background and any experience trying to play the guitar. You also want to get an idea of the types of music they like and their goals for learning guitar.
These questionnaires can help you better tailor the lessons to each individual student. For example, if a student's goal is to be able to play a certain song, you can identify the chords in that song and start there.
Some students will appreciate a lot of theory and practicing scales early on, before moving to actual songs. Other students will get frustrated with this. The questionnaire and conversation with your students can help you identify how they will be happiest with their lessons.

, Your students aren't going to learn to play guitar if all they do is show up to their sessions and then leave their guitar in its case all week. Finger positions and strumming patterns will only become natural with repetition.For students that aren't very self-motivated or self-directed, you might want to provide them with a basic practice schedule. List the things you've gone over in the lesson, and leave space for them to place a check mark after each thing for each day they practice it.
At the beginning of each lesson, briefly go over what was covered in the last lesson. If the student was given a song to play for practice, ask them to play it for you so you can evaluate their progress.
If your students fail to practice, start a dialogue to find out why. Be open and understanding. If they have something else going on in their life that is preventing them from making a commitment to practicing, you may want to allow them to postpone their lessons until their schedule loosens up a bit.

, Beginning guitarists are going to have difficulty moving their fingers with speed and agility. This is especially true for those who've never played any other stringed instrument.You typically can find a number of finger-strengthening exercises online. Many are geared specifically for students beginning to learn guitar. Look for exercises that focus on building finger muscles and spreading the fingers.
Even students who have played other instruments may need to strengthen their pinky fingers, which often don't get worked as much with other instruments as they do with guitar.
The stronger the student's fingers get, the easier they will find it to move more quickly and accurately on the fret board.

Start by teaching friends for free.,
Research rates for guitar instruction locally.,
Establish a presence on social media.,
Rely on word-of-mouth at first.,
Expand to other methods of promotion.",How to Teach Guitar2," If you have any friends who are interested in learning how to play guitar, offer to help them. This can be a way to develop your teaching skills and learn what methods are most effective.If you're a reasonably good guitarist, chances are someone's already asked you to teach them. If not, ask some of your friends who don't know how to play guitar if they'd like to learn.
Working with someone you know is helpful because they'll give you honest feedback on what's helping them and what's not.
You'll also get a good idea of what kinds of information you need to know from your students. While you may already know these things from your friend, and have the ability to intuitively tailor a lesson to their interests, you can always reverse-engineer that to figure out what information you relied upon when formulating your lesson plans.
Be careful not to lapse into a more friendly manner in these practice sessions. You can crack jokes or share stories, but keep in mind that you're trying to develop good teaching methods – not hang out with your friend.

, Once you feel confident enough in your teaching abilities to start looking for students publicly, spend some time evaluating the local market. You need to be able to price your lessons competitively.If you set your rates too high, you'll have a hard time attracting students. On the other hand, setting rates too low means you won't be properly compensated for your time.
Compare yourself to other instructors objectively, including relevant background and skill level. For example, as a beginning instructor you wouldn't want to charge as much as someone with 20 years experience or a college degree in music education.
You also need to keep in mind the age range of students that you ideally want. This will impact the rates you charge as well as your advertising and marketing strategy.

, When you're just getting started teaching guitar, social media can be a good way to get the word out. Start a basic website and build connected social media accounts. Share the information with everyone you know.You can build social media accounts without spending any money, which is part of what makes this a great way to spread the word about your services at the start. Later, you can decide if you want to spend money to promote your posts or create online advertising. Social media also helps you build your brand. Pick a name for your business and use the same user names on all websites.
You may want to set up a discount system for those who find out about your lessons through social media, or who share your posts or make a referral.
You also can create posts with a code for a free introductory lesson. Make sure when you craft the introductory lesson that the student will learn something right away and feel like they're advancing toward their goal of learning to play guitar in a positive and productive way.

, If you've decided you ultimately want to grow your business until you're teaching guitar full time, start small. Using word-of-mouth doesn't cost you any money, and can help you build a loyal following.One way you can do this is by offering a discount for existing students who refer new students to you.
After you've had a student for a month and they seem dedicated, remind them of the referral offer. They've had enough time with you by that point to know if they would recommend your services to others.

, Once you've had a little experience teaching a few students, you may want to start looking for other ways to find students, including directories and fliers in music stores or coffee shops.Think about where people interested in music often congregate – this could include record stores and local music venues. Ask the owners if they have a bulletin board for advertising guitar instructor services.
Schools also can be good places to advertise your services, particularly college campuses.
You also can expand to online advertising, which can be a relatively inexpensive way to get the word out. Try to place advertisements with websites that cater to local or regional interests.

Require advance payments.,
Continue to study and expand your teaching methods.,
Keep meticulous records.,
Set up an LLC.",How to Teach Guitar3," You don't want to do work and not get paid. But if you don't require tuition from your students up-front, that may be what happens. Choose billing options that best suit your financial needs.The easiest option is to have students commit to a month at a time, and pay for that month up front. This method not only makes accounting easier for you, but also ensures a level of commitment from your students.
Paying in advance for a month's worth of lessons also makes it easy for you to schedule and allot your time, which is immensely important if you are working a day job and teaching guitar on the side.

, The more you improve as a musician and a teacher, the more students you will attract. Becoming a better guitarist yourself also means you can keep students for a longer period of time.For example, if you are an intermediate guitar player, you may have no problem teaching beginners. But once your students become as good a player as you are, you have to let them go because you have nothing more to teach them. While you can probably find other beginners, you're limiting yourself if you don't continually improve your own skills.
With time and experience, you will learn new teaching methods or new tricks that help a particular thing to ""click"" with your students. Expand your repertoire by talking to other guitar teachers on a regular basis and getting ideas from them.
You might consider joining a band or doing open-mic performances on your own to gain exposure. Someone listening to you play may be interested in learning from you.

, When you start teaching guitar, you are also starting a small business. Regardless of whether you just want to teach guitar on the side, or eventually want to grow your business and quit your day job, good record keeping is essential.You may want to subscribe to a bookkeeping app or service so you can quickly and accurately record your income and business-related expenses.
Keep in mind that you will have to include your income on your taxes, but you also can deduct expenses related to your guitar teaching business. For example, if you're teaching students in their own home, you can deduct the mileage to and from those lessons. You also can deduct the cost of materials, such as guitar strings or paper used to print handouts for students.
You may want to set up a meeting with a small business advisor or an accountant so you can get a handle on the records you need to be keeping and how long you need to keep them.

, Particularly if you intend to teach guitar full-time, you'll want to organize your business into a defined structure to separate it from your personal finances. Creating an LLC is perhaps the simplest way to do this.Setting up an LLC means that if one of your students has a legal dispute with you, or if you have a dispute with another business, your personal assets will be protected and they won't be able to go after those.
Consult a local attorney to find out what the requirements are for setting up an LLC where you live. Typically you can do everything yourself without having to hire an attorney to do it for you.
There also may be other permits or licenses that you need to conduct your business legally in your area.
If you live in the United States, you'll need to register your business name and the business itself with your state's Secretary of State.

Practice your pentatonic scale until it’s perfect.,
Practice an A Minor scale in 5th position.,

Find and practice more scales.There are hundreds of different scales and exercises that you can practice to train your ear to pick up on musical cues and train your hands to move faster.",How to Teach Yourself to Play Guitar," Depending on what caliber instrument you want to buy, a guitar can cost as little as $30, or it may run you several thousand dollars. Obviously, you get what you pay for. How seriously do you plan to take this new hobby? If you’re very serious about learning to play the guitar, it will be worth your while to invest a little more money in your first instrument, as the sound quality will be significantly better, and you’ll be happier with your purchase in the long run. However, if you’re just looking for something to keep you occupied for a little while, you might as well buy a cheaper instrument.


Any guitar you purchase new and unused that costs less than $100 will probably fall squarely into the “toy” or “novelty” guitar category. Only purchase guitars that cheap if you aren’t taking this hobby very seriously.
A mediocre starter guitar will likely cost around $150-$200.
A guitar between $200 and $300 is a good investment for a starter guitar; even if you purchase a higher quality instrument later, this first instrument will likely be of a quality that will stand the test of time.
A good rule of thumb is to stick to cheaper models produced by the big, reliable brands. A partial list of reliable brands includes Gibson, Fender, Epiphone, Yamaha, and Ibanez, but there are many more.
Note that an electric guitar will also require the purchasing of an amplifier, which will be a significant additional cost, depending on quality.
You can also look for used guitars in pawn stores, where you might find a high quality instrument at a much lower price.;
, Some people say that because acoustics are larger, have thicker strings, and are generally more difficult to play, beginners should start with acoustic guitars to build up their finger strength and agility. Others say that beginners should buy electric guitars because they’re thinner and easier to play. All you should worry about is the sound you want to produce with your guitar.


Acoustic guitars produce sound through the vibrations produced by the strings. The strings themselves make very little sound; play an electric guitar without an amplifier and it’s the first thing you’ll notice.Instead, the vibration of the strings travels through the saddle and bridge (located toward the bottom of the guitar) to the flat upper surface of the guitar, called the soundboard.The vibration of the soundboard, combined with the subsequent vibration of the air inside the hollow body of the guitar, produce a sound that comes out through the center hole in the body.
Electric guitars have solid bodies, so they can’t produce sound through the vibration of the air inside. They rely, instead, on a set of “pickups,” which are magnets, wrapped in copper wire, that convert the vibration of each string into an electrical current. That current travels through a cord to an amplifier, producing the pitch produced by the vibration of each specific cord. Because the sound is produced electrically through an amplifier, you can manipulate the sound of an electric guitar far more than you can an acoustic guitar, which creates its sound through its own body.
When buying a guitar, think about the style of music you plan to play. Acoustic guitars are well-suited to folk, country, and much rock music, but hard rock, jazz, etc. will likely sound better on an electric guitar.

, If you buy a guitar online, you won’t know anything about its most important aspects: the sound it produces, how it feels in your hands, how it fits against your body, etc. You should always try out several guitars in-store before you make a decision about which one you want to invest in.


Make sure you find a guitar that is right-handed if you’re right-handed, and left-handed if you’re left-handed.
Buy a guitar that’s sized appropriately for you. You’re going to give up easily if your instrument doesn’t feel comfortable on your body.
Buy a guitar with a low “action,” if possible. The action is the height of the strings off the fingerboard; the higher the action, the higher the strings stand off the fingerboard, where you’ll be pushing them down to play different notes. If the strings are too high off the fingerboard, the strings will cut more deeply into your fingers as you push on them, and the result can be quite painful until you build up callouses.
Even if you don’t know what you’re doing, press some random frets and strum the guitar. Can you comfortably play the guitar without it creating an irritating buzzing sound? Don’t buy a buzzy guitar!
Don’t be afraid to ask the staff at the music store for guidance. They’re there to help, and they love talking about instruments!

, If you want to play while standing, you’ll need a guitar strap to hang the guitar from your neck and shoulders. You probably also want to buy some guitar picks, which are very inexpensive. Both of these items can be found in any music store, or online. If an employee at a music store tries to sell you additional accessories (like capos, tuners, etc.), politely decline; you can purchase those later when you know your way around a guitar better, but for now, this is all you need.


If you buy an electric guitar, you’ll need to purchase an amplifier as well.

, This is the most important thing to do when you begin learning. Once the guitar is ready, it’s fairly easy to keep it in tune, but tuning it the first time can be difficult if you haven’t yet developed an ear for it. If you’re buying a guitar at a music store, as a store employee to tune it for you before you leave the store. If not, you should ask an acquaintance more familiar with the guitar to tune it for you, or take it to a music store and ask an employee to quickly tune it, as a favor. You might buy something small, like a pack of picks, to make up for it. Once the guitar is in tune, you should check to make sure it remains in tune before every practice session.


Purchase a tuning app on your phone. gStrings is a popular app for Android devices, whereas Guitar Tuna is a popular iPhone app. Play each string individually, making sure to pluck the string loudly and clearly without holding any frets down.
Adjust the corresponding tuning peg up or down until the tuning app lets you know that string is in tune.
Repeat this process for all of the strings until your whole guitar is in tune.

, Hold your guitar as though you’re going to play it, and look down at the neckboard.


The string that’s pointing up at you is the E string. The strings, starting with E and moving down to the bottom of the neckboard, are E, A, D, G, B, and e.
The fret closest to the head (furthest away from the body) is your first fret. The next one down the board is the second, the next the third, and so on.
Almost all guitars have symbols on specific frets to help players see where they are on the neckboard without having to count. Usually, there is a symbol of some sort on every odd-numbered fret, beginning with the third.

, An empty tablature chart will simply show the six strings of the guitar, labeled as though you were holding your guitar face-up in your lap: the E string is on the bottom, and the e string is on the top.


e ------------------------
B ------------------------
G ------------------------
D ------------------------
A ------------------------
E ------------------------
Alternately, the six strings may just be numbered, with the E string being string 6 and the e string being string 1.

, Tabs use numbers placed on the line of the tab charts to indicate which fret should be played on each string. If a line has a 0 on it, that means that you should pluck that string “open,” without holding down any frets. So, for example, in the following tab chart, you should only play the third fret on the sixth string:


e ------------------------
B ------------------------
G ------------------------
D ------------------------
A ------------------------
E ----3-------------------

, Just like reading a sentence, you read a tab from left to right, playing each note one after the other. So, in the following tab, you should play the third fret on string E, then play string An open, then play the second fret on string D.


e ------------------------
B ------------------------
G ------------------------
D -------------2----------
A ---------0--------------
E ----3-------------------

, To indicate a chord, tabs line up all the frets and strings that should be played in the same vertical alignment. Any strings that should be muted (left unplayed) are marked by an X. So, for example, an A chord would be symbolized like this:


e -------0-----------------
B ------2------------------
G ------2------------------
D ------2------------------
A ------0------------------
E ------X------------------
In this chord, the 6th string is left unplayed, the 5th is played open, the 4th, 3rd, and 2nd are all played with their second fret held down, and the 1st string is played open. With your fingers in that position, you would strum all strings together.

, There are a number of websites where you can find free tabs for almost any song you can think of.Use these to teach yourself to play your favorite songs!

, You’ll likely get frustrated the first few times you try to play a song from tabs. There are a lot of numbers to keep track of, and it will take your brain some time to get used to matching up what’s on the tab with the guitar that you’re looking at. Don’t give up, though! With time and practice, you’ll be able to play the guitar like a pro!

, Use the following tablature to practice an E major pentatonic scale:


e-------------------------------------------0---3----------------|
B-----------------------------------0---3------------------------|
G---------------------------0---2--------------------------------|
D-------------------0---2----------------------------------------|
A-----------0---2------------------------------------------------|
E---0---3--------------------------------------------------------|

, Even accomplished guitar players often practice their scales, because going up and down the scales improves finger strength, speed, and agility. You might memorize the finger placements fairly easily, but it will take a lot of practice to be able to play the notes perfectly without having to look at your fingers on the neckboard. It will take even longer to be able to play the scales as fast as the pros, so keep practicing!

, By 5th position, we mean that you treat the fifth fret as though it were the first fret on the neckboard:


e-------------------------------------------5-7-8-
B----------------------------------5-6-8---------
G-------------------------4-5-7------------------
D--------------------5-7-------------------------
A------------5-7-8-------------------------------
E----5-7-8---------------------------------------

, These scales help get your fingers used to moving up and down the six strings of the guitar. If you practice them enough, your fingers will get used to the feeling of transitioning from one string to the next without having to look down at the neckboard.:


e------------------------------------5-7-8-7-5----------------------------------
B----------------------------5-6-8-------------8-6-5---------------------------
G--------------------4-5-7----------------------------7-5-4--------------------
D---------------5-7-------------------------------------------7-5---------------
A--------5-7-8----------------------------------------------------8-7-5--------
E-5-7-8-------------------------------------------------------------------8-7-5-

, These scales force you to skip strings instead of moving through them by progression. This will help your fingers memorize not only where frets are located, but where strings are located without having to look at the neckboard.


e---------------------------------5-7-8----------
B-----------------------------------------5-6-8-
G------------------------4-5-7------------------
D---------5-7-----------------------------------
A----------------5-7-8--------------------------
E-5-7-8-----------------------------------------

, Learn and practice all of your scales until you have them ingrained in your mind and fingers; these scales are the foundation of all the music you know and love! The more familiar you grow with the scales, the better you’ll be at picking up songs by ear and creating new songs of your own.

, It won't keep from coiling back a little bit, so don't get frustrated when it does that.

,,, Put the snake brush either through the mouthpiece hole, or through pipe of you tuning slide. These two areas are both on one big pipe, the one with the ring and water key. Whenever I do this, I put my snake brush through the bottom hole of the tuning slide. Whichever way you put it in, the end will always poke out of the opposite hole you put it through. I prefer the bottom tuning slide hole because the other way, your brush always jams into the turn in the pipe. If you push it through the mouthpiece area, don't get frustrated and try to jam it in there if you can't get the brush through the corner. Just go through the other way and your brush maybe won't get jammed in there. I don't know why, but that always works for me.

, (You don't have to yank it like you're starting a chainsaw or anything.)

, When you pull out the snake brush, it will most likely have some gunk or water on it. If it does, you should take out your lacquer cloth and wipe the brush down. You may want to wipe the plastic or wire part of your snake brush, since the brush part isn't the only thing going through the trumpet.

, Easy enough, right?

, But notice this! One part of the slide is shorter than the other part. The shorter part goes on top. It's a little hard to put the slide back in, but just don't force it.

, Mine's supposed to be about a half-inch out, set yours the way you should.

, Be sure to put your snake brush and lacquer cloth back into your trumpet case. Don't leave them lying around.

Always practice with a comfortable backing beat behind you.,
Focus on the drummer, particularly the snare or kick drum, to help find the beat.,
Tap your feet along with the song.,
Practice coming back in on the beat.",How to Stay on Beat Playing Guitar1," The best way to learn rhythm is to always have a rhythmic guide behind you. If you're working on playing along to a metronome, other musician, or just a jam track found on the internet, you're forced to stay on beat in a way you can never learn if playing in dead silence.









Metronomes are essential for serious musicians -- even 5-10 minutes a day of metronome practice can be helpful.
Always practice at a speed that challenges you, but you can still hit most notes comfortably. If using a metronome, start at 70 BPM and work up from there.;
, If you're completely lost in a song, divert all of your sonic attention to the drummer. The snare drum (the crisp, popping notes) or the kick drum (the deep, bass-filled notes) are your best bets, as they generally hold the beat down for the band and audience. Once you hear it, try to count your way into it, matching up your ""1, 2, 3, 4"" with each beat of the drum.








, Get your body moving to stay on beat. Most guitarists use their feet to tap along with the drummer, helping them always stay locked into the groove. Unconsciously, your arms and hands will strum with the beat too, syncing up with your foot and thus the song.








, Once you've learned a bit and can stay on a straight beat with ease, start to challenge yourself. Set the metronome to drop out every other measure, or have a friend cover it up so you can't hear it. When it comes back in, you should still be perfectly in time with the beats of the metronome. Use these silent gaps to test your ability to stay on beat even without a partner.








"
"
Keep common note designations in mind, even if you don't read music.,
Count out a basic 4/4 rhythm, the same heard in almost all pop, rock, and radio songs.,
Understand that changing the length of the beat doesn't change the overall rhythm.,
Work on gliding between the four common rhythms seamlessly.",How to Stay on Beat Playing Guitar2," Staying on beat is all about having rhythm. So you need to understand the basic block of rhythm -- the beat. A beat is how long to play a note or chord. It is what the numbers stand for when you hear someone count out ""1 and, 2 and, 3 and, etc."" So what's the difference? Compare, for a moment, the four most common beats for guitarists:










Quarter notes: the bread and butter, this is just a quarter of a measure. For example, ""1, 2, 3, 4 // 1, 2, 3, 4"" is two measures of straight quarter notes.

Eighth notes: double the speed of quarter notes. This is when you hear the ""ands,"" being used as a beat, such as in ""1 and, 2 and, 3 and, 4 and // 1 and..."" Guitarists usually alternate up and down strokes

Eighth-note triplets: This is a little weirder, but no less important. Count out three evenly-spaced syllables per beat -- ""1 trip-let, 2 trip-let, 3 trip-let, 4 trip-let."" The important thing to remember, when playing triplets, is to think of each set of three notes as one quick beat, not three separate beats.

Sixteenth notes: This is four evenly-spaced syllables, often counted out as ""1 E and a, 2 E and a, 3 E and a, 4 E and a..."" and is a quick, down-up-down-up strumming pattern. It often seems like it is just continuous up-down strumming., Even if you don't know any music theory, you know 4/4 time. It is the same rhythm you hear counted out -- ""1, 2, 3, 4 // 1, 2, 3, 4 // 1, 2..."" -- when bands start a song or a music teacher helps their students. It is, by far the most common time signature.









In 4/4 time, there are four quarter notes. The first 4 is for the number of notes, the second for length. Thus, the 3/2 time would consist of three half notes, or ""1..., 2... 3... // 1... 2... 3...""
Staying on beat means hewing to this 4/4 rhythm so that everyone counts out these four beats at the same speed, hitting them together., Many songs have what's called ""double time,"" which is simply when you go from quarter notes to eighth notes (or any other doubling of speed) for your rhythm. Remember, however, that this does not change the length of a measure, it simply doubles the notes in the measure. Many players will not only play more notes, they'll play them faster, losing the actual beat. Whenever changing the length of the beats, remember to keep the rhythm the same.









This is way metronomes are so essential -- they can keep you on rhythm even when your strumming needs to change.
Think about keeping the same downstroke rhythm for each strum of double time. Each downstroke should be the same distance apart, but you add an extra upstroke in between to double the number of notes. This keeps the actual rhythm intact.

, Put on a backing track or a metronome and start counting out, ""1, 2, 3, 4."" Strum on each beat, playing out two measures. Then seamlessly transition to eighth notes for two measures, then triplets, then sixteenth notes. When done, work back down. One of the best ways to stay on beat is to practice changing these rhythms without speeding up or slowing down. If you can do that, you can play with any band out there.

Set the gain on your amp to a moderate amount. You want each note to have uniform volume and sustain, but if you set the gain too high, it will be virtually impossible to mute the other strings.
Make sure your guitar strings are all at the same intonation. Using your neck pickup will help reduce a lot of noise.;

When you sweep pick, you essentially let the pick fall from string to string in one smooth, continuous stroke.
Imagine that your hand is being pulled by a string tied to your wrist. Release the tension in your hands so you're holding the pick loosely.
Keep the pick moving at whatever tempo you've chosen – don't stop to pick each individual string. If you break the momentum of your picking, you'll have a hard time being able to sweep pick clean and fast., One method that can get your strumming hand used to gliding or sweeping over the strings for sweep picking is to take chords you know and like, and arpeggiate them to articulate each note./images/thumb/d/de/Sweep-Pick-Step-3-Version-6.jpg/v4-550px-Sweep-Pick-Step-3-Version-6.jpg
/images/thumb/d/de/Sweep-Pick-Step-3-Version-6.jpg/v4-300px-Sweep-Pick-Step-3-Version-6.jpg









Doing this also will get you used to how slowly your hand actually needs to move, even if the notes are coming relatively quickly.
Keep in mind that what you're doing right now is not sweep picking, because the strings continue to resonate as you play. To sweep pick, you must learn how to mute all the other strings except the one you're fretting.

, Rolling your fingers to mute a string immediately after playing it is what gives a sweep picked arpeggio its distinct sound. Your barring finger should be extended and slightly arched so you can rock it back and forth./images/thumb/e/e8/Sweep-Pick-Step-4-Version-6.jpg/v4-550px-Sweep-Pick-Step-4-Version-6.jpg
/images/thumb/e/e8/Sweep-Pick-Step-4-Version-6.jpg/v4-300px-Sweep-Pick-Step-4-Version-6.jpg









Essentially, the first knuckle of your finger is going to collapse to mute the string immediately after playing it.
If you're just starting to learn to sweep pick, your fingers may have trouble with this unfamiliar movement. Do exercises to limber up your fingers and improve their agility.
One exercise you can do is to simply extend all your knuckles on both hands so that your fingers are straight. Then gently press your opposing fingertips together. Hold for about 5 seconds, then release. You can do this exercise as many times as you want, just make sure not to press too hard., If you watch master sweep pickers play, you'll notice that their hands don't actually move all that much, or move all that fast – relative to the barrage of notes they're playing./images/thumb/3/3e/Sweep-Pick-Step-5-Version-6.jpg/v4-550px-Sweep-Pick-Step-5-Version-6.jpg
/images/thumb/3/3e/Sweep-Pick-Step-5-Version-6.jpg/v4-300px-Sweep-Pick-Step-5-Version-6.jpg









Faster playing comes from making more efficient movements, not from moving your hands faster.
You can do finger strengthening exercises to increase the power and efficiency of your fingers and hands. This well help you sweep pick at a faster tempo.

, To sweep cleanly, your pick and your fretting fingers must make contact with the string you want to play at exactly the same time. This can take practice to do with precision./images/thumb/d/d4/Sweep-Pick-Step-6-Version-6.jpg/v4-550px-Sweep-Pick-Step-6-Version-6.jpg
/images/thumb/d/d4/Sweep-Pick-Step-6-Version-6.jpg/v4-300px-Sweep-Pick-Step-6-Version-6.jpg









If you've mastered the technique that you should use with each hand, it should be easier to coordinate them than if you're struggling to learn those and trying to coordinate at the same time.
Go slowly at first, focusing on your two hands acting in unison. Keep in mind it is possible that your more dominant hand is going to be faster than the other, so keep your practices at a slow tempo and gradually build up to faster speeds only when your hands are naturally synchronized.
Synchronizing your hands is one of the most difficult parts about sweep picking, and it's one that can only be achieved with practice. There aren't any special exercises or drills you can do that will improve this for you.

, As you're practicing sweep picking and working on your technique, a metronome can help you maintain the same tempo and keep your hands synchronized./images/thumb/d/d3/Sweep-Pick-Step-7-Version-6.jpg/v4-550px-Sweep-Pick-Step-7-Version-6.jpg
/images/thumb/d/d3/Sweep-Pick-Step-7-Version-6.jpg/v4-300px-Sweep-Pick-Step-7-Version-6.jpg









Start with your metronome set to eighth notes. It may seem slow to you at first, but stick with this speed until you have progressed to doing six-string arpeggios.
Once you've mastered six-string arpeggios with eight notes, you can gradually move up to sixteenth notes.

, You want to ensure that only one string is sounding at a time. All other strings should be muted with your other fingers as you fret the string you want to play./images/thumb/3/3f/Sweep-Pick-Step-8-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Sweep-Pick-Step-8-preview-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/3/3f/Sweep-Pick-Step-8-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Sweep-Pick-Step-8-preview-Version-2.jpg









When you play, you should only be fretting one string at a time. Your remaining fingers have the work of muting all the other strings. If the other strings are sounding, you'll just sound like you're strumming a chord – there won't be any separation between the notes characteristic of a sweep pick.
Keep in mind that the practice of muting the other strings may be one of the more difficult parts of sweep picking to master. Be patient and take your time as you practice.
When you're just starting, it might help to fold a washcloth and secure it to the frets with a large rubber band. This will mute the strings for you and prevent unwanted noise.

, If you're finding a particular area of an arpeggio difficult, it may be because your fingers can't move efficiently to play those notes. Work on the notes that give you problems by themselves./images/thumb/1/1d/Sweep-Pick-Step-9-Version-4.jpg/v4-550px-Sweep-Pick-Step-9-Version-4.jpg
/images/thumb/1/1d/Sweep-Pick-Step-9-Version-4.jpg/v4-300px-Sweep-Pick-Step-9-Version-4.jpg









You can create your own two- or three-note drill out of the portion of an arpeggio that you find difficult. Drill it, first with each hand by itself, and then with both hands together, until you can play it as cleanly as you play the rest of the arpeggio.

, Once you've got the fundamentals of sweep picking down, you may want to go in for a session or two with a guitar teacher who can watch you play and show you where your technique is sloppy./images/thumb/c/c6/Sweep-Pick-Step-10-Version-4.jpg/v4-550px-Sweep-Pick-Step-10-Version-4.jpg
/images/thumb/c/c6/Sweep-Pick-Step-10-Version-4.jpg/v4-300px-Sweep-Pick-Step-10-Version-4.jpg









If you have a friend who is skilled at sweep picking, they also may be able to help you figure out how you can improve.
You might also watch videos online. If you can videotape yourself, you can compare your own sweep picking to the hands of someone on a video who has mastered the technique. This is another way to identify areas where you can improve.
Break down the job of each individual finger on your fretting hand, so you can figure out which finger isn't doing exactly what it's supposed to be doing and work on that movement.

, Sweep picking can take several months to do cleanly and correctly. However, you can improve little by little if you take just a few minutes each day to work on your technique./images/thumb/7/70/Sweep-Pick-Step-11-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Sweep-Pick-Step-11-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/7/70/Sweep-Pick-Step-11-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Sweep-Pick-Step-11-Version-2.jpg









In addition to practicing your sweep picking mechanics, you also want to practice scales, so your fingers will become accustomed to moving through basic patterns.
You also might practice your hammer-ons and pull-offs, which can improve the speed and efficiency with which you roll your fretting finger when sweep picking., Once you're drilling different arpeggios, practice by spending about five minutes fretting the arpeggio without strumming. Then spend another five minutes picking the arpeggio without fretting./images/thumb/0/0e/Sweep-Pick-Step-12-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Sweep-Pick-Step-12-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/0/0e/Sweep-Pick-Step-12-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Sweep-Pick-Step-12-Version-2.jpg









Do this first with two-string sweeps. Once you've mastered the mechanics of two-string sweeps, isolate your hands again to learn the movements with three-string sweeps, and so on.
Keep in mind that if each hand hasn't mastered what it's supposed to do, it will be much more difficult to have your hands working in synchronization.

, When you're just learning to sweep pick, two-string sweeps allow you to work on the mechanics and synchronize your hands, because neither of your hands has to move very far or very much./images/thumb/d/d3/Sweep-Pick-Step-13-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Sweep-Pick-Step-13-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/d/d3/Sweep-Pick-Step-13-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Sweep-Pick-Step-13-Version-2.jpg









Two-string sweeps also can help you with muting, because you'll only have to roll between two strings, essentially switching back and forth between them.
You also can do basic sweeps based on arpeggiated chords, which you can build yourself using chords you already know.

, When you've mastered two-string sweeps, move on to three-string sweeps, then four-string sweeps, and so on. Stay at the same tempo as you progress and focus on keeping your hands synchronized./images/thumb/d/d3/Sweep-Pick-Step-14-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Sweep-Pick-Step-14-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/d/d3/Sweep-Pick-Step-14-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Sweep-Pick-Step-14-Version-2.jpg









When you start working into longer arpeggios, break them down into four-bar sequences and practice the shorter parts. Once you've mastered each sequence, you can start putting them together.

Treat your guitar with care.,
If you're going to ever take it out of the house, then head down to your local guitar store and check prices for padded gig bags or even better, cases.",How to Take Care of a Guitar1," Treat guitars how you would treat guitars at the store, or maybe your other valuable possessions. Never lay it down on the ground when you are not playing it or doing maintenance on it. The best place for your guitar is inside it's own fitted case or something that will hold it properly. You can choose between a hard case, or a gig bag, or hang it on a wall hanger or stand it up on a floor stand.


If you have an electric guitar, try loosening the strings a bit so you can remove the dust that most likely has gathered around the pickups.






If you have an acoustic, loosen the strings and remove the dust by the bridge.






You don't need to loosen them much, just enough to get a cloth underneath. *Prod the hardware to see if it is loose, and if it is, see if there is a screw you can tighten.

Restringing a guitar is not as hard as it may seem.,
A real nice thing to possess is a string winder, it makes the process of unwinding and winding string much easier.,
Make sure you have a few wraps around the peg for if not, the string will go out of tune more often and easily.

There are several different ways the guitar manufacturers make bridges.",How to Take Care of a Guitar2," Make sure you have the correct strings for any guitar you have, you can also mix and match different gauges and metal material for electrics.


You might find it easier to start with high E (1st string), but it doesn't matter where you start.





;
, It is not a required tool however, but most certainly recommend that you should use, just in case of accidental string breaks on stage. First, you unwind the string at the machine head. Keep on turning until the string is so loose you can wind off the string with your hands and removing it from the machine. Then, you go down to the bridge and notice how the string is fastened there.

,, However, on most electrics, it is quite simple and you do not need a tool to loosen the strings, except if you have a Floyd Rose system, and then the strings are fastened by tightening the string into a clamp. For this, you need a hex wrench tool but you should have been provided if you bought the guitar new.

Decide what kind of tone you want to have.,

Plug in your compressor pedal after the filter pedals.,
Add overdrive and distortion pedals.,
Decide where to place any pitch-shifting pedals.,
Connect modulation pedals towards the end of your signal chain.,
Place volume pedals at the beginning or end of your signal chain.,
Position any time-based pedals last.",How to Set Up Guitar Pedals1," While there are some standard configurations for guitar pedals, the order of your pedals depends on the tone you want to achieve. This will differ depending on the style of music you play.Make sure you're preserving the functionality of the pedal. Keep in mind that switching the order can have a drastic effect on the tone produced. You may want to experiment with some pedals in different positions until you find the sound you want.
Once you've chosen your order, number your pedals so you can easily reproduce the same order and don't have to memorize it.;
, When choosing the cables that connect your pedals, be willing to invest in quality. The better the cable, the better the tone from your guitar.Your patch cables should be as short as possible. Longer cables will cause the signal to degrade and your tone will suffer.

, If you use a chromatic tuner pedal, plug your guitar directly into the tuner. You want the pedal to tune your guitar's clean, unmodulated signal rather than the heavily distorted sound produced by first running the signal through other effects pedals., Filter pedals, such as auto-wahs, envelope filters, and wah-wahs, typically work best when they follow your tuner pedal. If you don't use a tuner pedal, filter pedals should be first in your setup.Any filter should modulate a clean signal. Placing them after other effects pedals limits their ability to function properly.
This also may be a good position for phaser pedals, depending on the type of tone you want to achieve.

, Compressor pedals ""level out"" your guitar's volume, boosting the volume of quieter tones.You'll get lots of noisy, unwanted sound if you put the compressor pedal later on in the chain when the guitar's tone has already been heavily modified.Depending on the type of music you're playing, you may actually want your compressor pedal at the end of your chain. For example, if you're playing country music, a compressor pedal at the end of the chain squashes everything, regardless of the effects you're using. With rock music, on the other hand, it typically works better right after the filter pedals.

, Overdrive and distortion pedals are some of the most popular types of effects pedals, particularly in rock music. Placing these pedals before filter and compressor pedals can produce an unpleasant tone.Overdrive and distortion pedals generate and amplify the overtones of each note you play. For this reason, you don't want amplified overtones fed into filter or compressor pedals.

, In most cases, a pitch-shifting pedal functions best when it's being fed a compressed signal. You generally want to place it after compression or equalizer pedals, unless you've positioned your compressor pedal at the end of your chain., If you're using any modulation pedals such as chorus, flanger, tremolo, or phaser pedals, you generally want to place them later in your signal chain so they have a richer sound.If you have multiple modulation-style pedals, you may want to experiment with their order until you find the best arrangement that will give your guitar the tone you want.

, Whether you put the volume pedal earlier or later in the signal chain affects what part of your guitar's sound the pedal adjusts, and gives this pedal a different functionality.Near the beginning of your signal chain, closest to your guitar, the volume pedal will adjust the volume of your unmodulated signal going into other effects pedals. It can be helpful to clean up your sound if you use overdrive a lot.
Placing your volume pedal towards the end of your signal chain adjusts the volume of the finished signal.

, When ordering time-based pedals such as delay pedals, think of how the sound you're creating actually occurs in physical space. Since delay or echo is the last thing heard, it makes sense to place these types of pedals at the end of the signal chain.Keep in mind that placing a delay pedal before a volume pedal can make it more difficult to control the volume of each successive delay or echo effect.

"
"
Examine your amp.,
Place your delay and reverb effects in the amp's effects loop.,
Move volume and modulation into the effects loop.",How to Set Up Guitar Pedals2," Not all amps have an effects loop, but if yours does, you can experiment with placing some of your effects inside your amp's effects loop to give your guitar a richer, more nuanced tone.The effects loop is before the power amp section but after the preamp of your amplifier. You'll see ""Effects Send"" and ""Effects Return"" jacks. On some amps these may also be labeled ""Preamp Out"" and ""Power Amp In.""

, Most guitarists who use the effects loop to set up their guitar pedals put the time-based effects in the loop to avoid the washed out sound that can be produced if these effects are fed into the overdrive and distortion of the amp.This set-up can give you a clearer sound if your amp is generating sound that is overdriven or distorted. The sound from your amplifier's preamp section feeds into these effects.

, Placing modulation pedals in the effects loop will give you a different sound than if you run them through your signal chain directly from your guitar. Experiment with these and see if it suits your style.Moving the volume pedal inside the effects loop allows you to control the entire sound coming out of the amplifier.

"
Choose the right size.,
Check the power requirements of your pedals.,
Find an adequate power supply.,
Use compact patch cables.,
Velcro your pedals to the board.",How to Set Up Guitar Pedals3," Pedal boards can be bought off the shelf or customized to your particular set-up. Whether you choose a small, medium, or large pedal board generally depends on the number of pedals you're using on a regular basis and the size of those pedals.Generally, if you're using five or fewer pedals, you want a small pedal board. For more than ten pedals, on the other hand, you want a large pedal board.
Also take into consideration if you plan to add more pedals over time. For example, if you currently use four pedals but plan on adding three more, it's best to go ahead and get a medium-sized pedal board so you'll have room for the others when you get them.
If your pedals are oversized, you may want to get a large pedal board even if you're only using four or five pedals. This will prevent overcrowding.

, Whether you're buying a pre-built board or building your own, you need to make sure the pedal board will power all your pedals. While most pedals require 9 volts of power, some require more.Be sure to check the power requirements of every pedal in your set-up – don't just assume they're all the same.
You also want to check the power requirements of pedals you plan to add later on to ensure the board you buy can handle them.

, Your power supply needs to have the correct voltage as well as be able to handle the number of pedals you have or ultimately will have once your set-up is complete.For example, if you have 10 pedals, all of which require 9 volts, you'll need a 9-volt power supply capable of handling 10 or more pedals.
If you have one pedal that requires 12 volts, you'll need to look for a power supply that allows you to isolate pedals, because you don't want 12 volts running through the other pedals that require less power.

, While you do want to leave a little bit of space between pedals on your pedal board to keep it from looking cluttered, you still want to use extremely short patch cables to preserve the quality of your sound.Choose cables with right-angle plugs rather than straight plugs, and this will cut down on the amount of space the cables take.
If you have the tools to do so, you can pretty easily cut your own cables, which can both save you money and ensure that your cables are the exact length you need for your particular set-up.
Avoid black cables, as they can get lost on a stage and you may not be able to easily identify the problem if one is unhooked or damaged.

, Because you may want to change the order of your pedals to alter your guitar's tone, use a non-permanent means such as Velcro to fix the pedals in place on your pedal board.Particularly if you're working with a large number of pedals, you may want to stagger them so they alternate between the front and rear edges of the pedal board. This will make it easier for you to differentiate between them and hit the pedal you want during a performance.
Make sure the pedals you use most often are laid out so they are easiest for you to reach with your foot.
Keep in mind that the location of the pedals on the board doesn't necessarily need to follow the signal chain you've created exactly. However, you do want to follow it as closely as possible to reduce the length of the patch cables.

Check the straightness of the neck.,
Make a more precise measurement if you think it may be bowed out.,
Adjust the truss rod to adjust the neck.,
Check the angle between your neck and your body.",How to Set Up a Guitar1," Inspect the neck for signs of warping or bowing. To check more precisely, run a ruler along the length of the guitar, resting it on the frets. Do this on both sides to make sure your neck is not twisted.









You want your neck to have an ever-so-slight curve inwards, so the headstock will bow slightly toward the bridge. Guitar engineers refer to this curve as giving your neck some ""relief."" You should have a very slight gap between your neck and your straight edge. If your neck curves away from the strings, backward, you may have a problem that will affect the action of the guitar, and you should take it to a guitar shop to have it checked out.;
, Use the D string to check the straightness of the neck by checking the string height. After stringing the guitar, Fret the D string at the 1st and 22nd frets, or whichever is the highest fret on your fretboard, then check the distance between the string and the fretboard at the 12th fret. Ideally, you should just be able to slide a business card under it. You can check the straightness of the whole neck by fretting at different places, using the string as a straight edge.










If you've got access to a feeler gauge, take a capo and place it over the first fret. Hold down the lowest string at the last fret. With your feeler, gauge check the distance between the string and the 8th fret. The measurement should be approximately .010"" (0.254 mm). If this measurement is greater than .010"" you will have to tighten your truss rod by turning the Allen wrench clockwise.

, If you need to make an adjustment to the bow of the neck, remove the truss rod cover, which is usually located at the top of the neck on most guitars, but will also sometimes be at the bottom, closer to the bridge. Adjust delicately, using gentle quarter turns with the appropriate-sized allen wrench.










If your neck is too convex, you will have to turn your Allen wrench counterclockwise, raising the strings. When making this adjustment, take your time and only turn it a quarter of a turn at a time. Then let your guitar settle for a bit and re-tune it before checking again or attempting to play it. Let it sit overnight.

, If your truss rod is set correctly, but the strings above the 12th fret are too far from the fretboard, it's possible that there is an angle between your neck and your body. Make sure that your guitar is resting on a flat work surface, and remove the strings before you attempt to unbolt the neck. Bolt-on necks can be removed from the body by removing four screws at the back of the guitar, to ensure that the joint is flush.










The neck of your guitar should be parallel to the body of the guitar, but often there will be a lot of sawdust from the factory, which means the neck will be askew. If it is, clean up the area and bolt the neck back on.
If the angle of your neck is still incorrect, you can change it by putting a ""spacer"", either between the two bottom screws to tilt the neck backwards, or between the two top screws to tilt the neck forward. Something very thin, like Post-It notes, works fine. They stick to the surface and won't move as you bolt the neck back on. If you need a thicker spacer, just fold the Post-It note over itself.

Finished.









",How to Set Up a Guitar2," The ""action"" of a guitar refers to the height of the strings off the fretboard. Players with a light touch can usually get away with lower action, while heavy players may need more height to prevent rattling strings. The most important thing is that the string height is comfortable for you and that you do not have any fret buzz. If you have a couple of guitars try these procedures on the least precious one first and then attempt it on your treasure.










Start by measuring the distance from the bottom of the string to the first fret. This will help you determine whether the nut slots have been cut to the proper depth. If this measurement does not match up or come close to spec, you should take your guitar in to have this done. The string height at the twelfth fret will determine if your saddle should be raised our lowered. Here are the some standard specifications for electrics:

1st fret treble side - 1/64"" or .0156 (0.397 mm)
1st fret bass side - 2/64"" or .0313 (0.794 mm)
12th fret treble side - 3/64"" or .0469 (1.191 mm)
12th fret bass side - 5/64"" or .0781 (1.984 mm)



, Assuming that your truss rod is adjusted properly, and that the angle of your neck is correct, adjust the height of your treble E string so that it barely clears a standard US dime placed on the 12th fret. A dime is slightly less than 2/32"" (1.6 mm)) thick. You may want a slightly lower action, if you can manage it.










The G and B strings are adjusted similarly, but the bass E, and the A and D strings, which are coiled, can be further from the fretboard.

, Your guitar may be in tune on the first 12 frets, but when you get past the 12th fret and strike a chord it may sound terrible. If this occurs, you will know that you need to set your intonation. To do this, you will need to have a bridge that has adjustable saddles. Usually there will be screws on the bottom of the bridge that adjust the saddles forward or back, away from the top of the guitar. You should always set the intonation as the very last step of setting up your guitar, because every other adjustment that you make will change the intonation of your instrument.










To make adjustments, get your tuner and start on the low E string, checking the 12th fret harmonic (the note just above the fret), and the actual twelve fret E note. These should be the same. If they are not you will need to adjust the distance.

If the twelfth fret tone is higher than natural octave overtone, then lengthen the string by moving the saddle back towards the tailpiece.
If the twelfth fret tone is lower than the octave overtone, then you will have to shorten the string length and move the saddle up toward the top of the guitar.


Repeat this process for the rest of the strings and you'll have a fairly well intonated guitar. If you are a perfectionist, you can take your guitar into a repair shop that has a strobe tuner for even better accuracy.

, If a few specific frets buzz while you play them, you may have uneven frets. If you're brave, you can try to improve your frets by leveling them. First, make sure that your truss rod, action and neck angle are all set up properly; a neck with too much bow can exacerbate uneven frets. Then, if any frets are coming up, you can reset them with a plastic mallet.










If that's still not enough, you can sand down your frets. Make sure that your neck is as straight as possible (but don't break the truss rod) and make sure your guitar is resting on a flat surface, then cover your fingerboard and nearby finished surfaces with tape to protect them, leaving exposed only the frets. Get a sanding block with 100 grade sandpaper. You must then sand all the frets simultaneously with the sanding block. With the sanding block flat on the frets, any taller fret will get sanded down to the same height as the other ones.
If your frets are in very bad shape, leveling your frets will be too difficult and you may have to refret, that is, change all the frets on your neck. This is both hard and expensive, making it economical to consult a luthier for the job.

, The most important adjustment which is unique to the Floyd Rose, is to make sure that the tremolo bridge is properly balanced. First, check your truss rod as well as the angle of your neck and body. With your guitar tuned, look carefully at your tremolo bridge. It should be parallel to the body. If that is not the case, you must adjust the springs which are in the back of the guitar.










Tune your guitar again, and check the tremolo bridge. Repeat until the tremolo bridge is parallel to the body. Once that step has been performed, you must then re-tune, readjust the action, and finally the intonation. As you adjust the intonation, it is possible that the tremolo bridge will move and that the springs will need to be readjusted, in which case you will have to redo the intonation.

Know your instrument.,
Be honest about flaws.,
State what kind of music you use it for.,
Present the guitar well.,
Use as many ad services as possible.",How to Sell a Guitar," Unless you are dealing with a hobby collector, having a fairly detailed description of your guitar will go a long way to selling it. What make/model is it? What kinds of materials are used in your guitar? Is the body a solid unit, or is it laminated? What is the fretboard made out of? Does your guitar have any equipment upgrades that help it stand apart from the rest? What kind of paint finish does it have? Include as much of this information as you can in your advertisement, because buyers want to know that you are familiar with what you are selling and that they aren't driving all that way to see a guitar of questionable quality and origin.;
, If there is cosmetic damage to the instrument, it is bad form to hide it in your photographs and not be up front about it with potential buyers. Even with internal repairs, it is often worth the money to get the guitar fixed before it is sold. If there is extensive damage to any part of the guitar, be honest. Some buyers are looking for a guitar to restore, and you should adjust your price accordingly.

, Even if you are playing by yourself at home, most guitars have nuances that make them suitable for certain applications. Someone who is unfamiliar with your particular guitar might be tempted to buy it if they see that you play the same music as they do.

, Always place multiple pictures in your ads (if applicable), being sure to highlight features and the serial number. These pictures should be of high quality, so most cell phone pictures are not adequate. When someone comes to look at it, make sure it is clean, polished, and in tune before they arrive.

, Most online ad services are free, and offer the option of prime ad placement for a small amount of money. The premise here is simple: more coverage means more potential buyers.

You can also include what kind of material the guitar is made out of, the kind of strings you have on it, and anything else you can think of that might be important to a buyer.


If you are unsure of any specifics about the guitar you may need to do some research. Look online for information about your guitar or take it to a guitar store and see if they know any details about it.
If you are unsure at all about the details on your guitar, be sure to mention this when describing it in your ad. It's best to be straight forward, for instance stating that you ""think that the guitar was made in 1969"" instead of that ""the guitar was made in 1969."" This way you can avoid an unhappy buyer once the guitar sells.;
, Because you are putting your guitar up for auction, you won't set the price of sale but you will need to set a minimum bidding price. While it is possible to set no minimum bid, meaning that if only one person bids one cent they will win your auction, it's best to set a minimum amount you are willing to sell your guitar for.


Don't make the minimum too high however, as you want to entice bidders with a low price to begin with. In the spirit of an auction, it's best to make the minimum bid a bit less than you want to sell for and gamble that the bids will go higher.
Take into consideration how much you originally paid for the guitar, any scratches or damages, and how much similar guitars are selling for. Remember that although you might have just bought the guitar and hardly used it, it may still be worth less than a brand new one. People won't pay full price for a second hand guitar when they can buy one new for the same price.
Look online for recent sales of similar guitars in order to gauge what you should expect to get for your guitar. It can be helpful to research what others (both individual sellers and commercial outlets) are charging for similar used guitars, so that you can match the going rates.

, You'll want five to ten photos of the guitar from different angles using a good camera. Remember that any buyer will only have these photos to assess the quality and condition of your guitar. Since they can't look at it in person, try to make your photos as clear and comprehensive as possible.


Once you have some great shots, transfer them to your computer so they are ready to be uploaded when needed.
If there are any scratches on the guitar make sure you include photos of these to avoid buyer complaints after purchase.
If you want to provide an even clearer and more enticing ad, you could make a video showing the different angles of the instrument. You can even play it on video, if desired.

, You will need to let possible buyers know what it will cost to get the guitar to them, so contact your local post office or shipping service to get an estimate.


It is not a good idea just guess about shipping costs. You will need to charge a set amount in addition to what your auction goes for, so if you charge the buyer too little you will cut into your profits.

, You have the choice of a variety of different auction sites, however one of the most popular, and thus the one with the most possible buyers, is eBay.com.It's a good idea to post your guitar on only one auction website, as you only have one guitar to sell. If it were to sell on multiple sites you would not have multiple guitars to sell.
Remember that auction sites will charge different amounts for their services. Be clear on the cost to you, whether it's a percentage of the sale or a flat fee, before deciding to use the service.

, Now that you've got all the information about your guitar, great photos of it, decided on a minimum bid price, and you've decided what website you're going to use, you can start uploading your ad. Include all of the information and images you gathered for your sale.


The website you have chosen should have an easy system for uploading your ad. The large sites, in particular, have perfected their systems so that almost anyone can easily follow their directions. If you have tried and failed to figure it out, feel free to email their customer service agents to clarify what you don't understand. They may even have a webpage dedicated to helping you through the process.Make sure you're up front in the ad about the cost and estimated timeline for shipping. Don't try to hide any extra handling costs or fees.

, With the ad up, all you have to do is sit back and wait for the bids to come in. Your auction should run for a set amount of days. Bids will go until the very last second, at which time the final bid will dictate the selling price.


If potential bidders do contact you, be prepared to answer questions about the guitar. Respond as quickly and thoroughly as possible to build their confidence in you as a seller and encourage a sale.
If your guitar does not get any bids, then it has gone unsold. You have the choice of taking it off the market (or selling it in a different manner) or reposting it in another auction on the same site. Reposting it in another auction is usually a really quick and easy process.

, When you make the sale, be sure to complete the transaction and send the guitar off as quickly as possible. Provide evidence of shipping (including a tracking number, and potentially insurance), and stay in contact with the buyer if you have any trouble shipping the guitar quickly.


Be sure you have the payment in hand before sending off your guitar. When you set up the ad for your guitar, you will have also set up a plan for payment with the auction website. Payments made through the site may take a few days, so be sure that you have the funds in your personal account before you ship the guitar.
Make sure you pack the guitar safely and securely to avoid damage during shipping.

, Especially if you're planning on selling more items through the same account on the given website. Help increase your positive selling reviews by following up with your customers. Make sure they're satisfied with the product and delivery, and deal with any complaints swiftly.

Remove the strings.,
Remove the metal components.,
Understand the parts.",How to Relic a Guitar1," Before getting into modifying the appearance, you’ll need to remove the strings. Unwind the strings if they’re relatively new. If they’re old and the string slack has already been removed, then snap them off with wire cutters.Aged strings won’t add any benefits when you relic your guitar.;
, You should be able to remove all the metal parts using a screwdriver. Aging the metal pieces of the guitar isn’t necessary, but it’ll add to the overall look in the end. Be careful when removing the pickguard from your guitar if you have one. Most guitars are wired so that the pickguard is attached to the input jack.If it is attached, you'll need to clip the connection using wire cutters. Only do this if you are prepared to solder or pay someone to solder the connection back.

, Be methodical when removing gear from your guitar. Do not just put everything in a large pile to be dug through later. It might help to take photos as you remove components as a reminder of where everything goes. Organize your parts into piles like:


Metals from the neck in one spot.
The pickguard and other metals in one pile.
Then the parts of the bridge in another.
Keep track of which screws go with what component.

"
"
Create scratches on the metal manually.,
Let nature do the damage.,
Use chemicals.,
Age your pickups.",How to Relic a Guitar2," You can use a metal file to distress certain pieces of the guitar. Be selective of which components you file onto. Never attempt to scratch or directly impact the pick ups. Don’t use too much pressure to avoid appearing obvious.


Apply this to the tuning pegs, bridge, or input jack.

, You can leave some of the metal parts outdoors to subject them to the forces of nature. This could cause rusting which is a popular aspect of a reliced guitar. Leave the metal parts outside for one to two days. Inspect the parts before using a different technique.


Again don’t leave the pickups or other electrical components of the guitar outdoors., You don’t need to search too hard to find a chemical that will create an aged effect on the metals. You can use a household bathroom cleaner. Use either a cleaner with bleach or ammonia, but never combine bleach and ammonia. Dip the pieces of metal into a bucket filled three parts water to one part bathroom cleaner.Let the components sit for about three hours and check on their condition. Repeat as many times until you reach the desired look. Some people will leave them soaking for up to 11 hours.

, This is an optional step since the sound of your guitar is at stake. You can only age your pickups if you have metal humbuckers (silver or gold) or you have single coil pickups. You’ll first need to remove the casing so you don’t damage the literal pickup. This will vary depending on what pickup you have.


For steel casing you will use muriatic acid. This is a bit of an intense finish so you’ll need to wear rubber gloves and use precaution to cover your mouth and eyes. Apply the solution to a cloth and spread a thin layer over the case. Wait about ten minutes for the case to dry. If you want to age the pick ups more, then repeat the process. The aim is to not age it too much.
For single coil pick ups, you can get away with soaking the casing in coffee for a aged look. Let the case soak for about thirty minutes and then let it dry completely before using again. Repeat if you didn’t reach the desired hue."

Understand natural relicing.,
Scrub the guitar with an abrasive.,
Expose it to different temperatures.,
Use chemicals.,
Crack or chip the paint.,
Scratch up the pickguard.",How to Relic a Guitar3," It is possible for you to age your guitar by playing it every day for several years. Signs of age will show on areas of the guitar that are used the most. The oils from your hands, how you hold your guitar, and how you store and transfer your guitar all contribute to the natural relicing process.


You should understand the important spots that age naturally before aging the body yourself. This could result in an apparent amateur relicing job.
Look at road worn guitars and notice areas like where your hand rests, where your arm rests during strumming, underneath the pickups, around the control buttons, and between the frets., You can use either sandpaper or steel wool as your abrasive. You’ll need to remove the thin coat of polyurethane lacquer or nitrocellulose for the paint to chip.You can also make your shiny gloss finish into a matte finish by scrubbing the body with sandpaper. Steel wool will also distress the metals on the guitar nicely.


Use light pressure. The lacquer is a thin layer that won’t take too much effort to remove.
Apply the abrasive in a circular pattern.

, If you live somewhere that is very hot or cold, you might be able to create natural paint chips from exposing the body outdoors. Another ideal way to expose your guitar is by putting it into a freezer if it’s big enough or in direct sunlight.


You must remove the protective lacquer before subjecting the body to these temperatures., For a crackled finish, you can use ""dust-off"" spray. Another spray that has the same chemicals is a chewing gum remover spray. These sprays contain a chemical that causes the spray to be cold. Apply an even, light layer to the body and neck of the guitar.If you do spray the neck, cover up the fretboard unless you know it has a layer of lacquer already on it.
Let the body dry before reapplying any chemicals.

, Another way to age the main body of the guitar is to use elements on the surface to create cracks in the paint job. Find areas that are cracked in the guitar's paint. Use a flat head screwdriver to dramatize the crack. Only use the screwdriver to accentuate cracks already found on the guitar. Chip away paint using a screwdriver.

, The plastic pickguard that comes standard on many electric guitars is an easy thing to wear in. You can use a sharp, small object to create scratches in the pickguard's surface.


Understand that by playing regularly with a pick will cause scratches on the pickguard. Try not to overdo it or else people will know it was self-induced.

Find a strap that's right for you.,
Find the holes on either end of the strap.,
Connect the strap to the knob at the base of your guitar's body.,
Slip the other hole on the strap over the second knob.,
Slip the strap over your shoulder.,
Test your strap out by playing.,
Adjust the strap's length as needed.",How to Put a Strap On a Guitar1," Guitar straps come in a wide variety of styles and sizes - some are audacious, some are plain, some are thick and padded, others are thin ""seat belt""-style straps. Check out the selection at your local music store or in classified ads to get a sense of the options available to you. Below are just a few things you'll want to consider when picking out a strap:


Material - Many of the most affordable straps are made from the aforementioned seat belt-style material, but for a little more cash, it's possible to buy durable all-leather straps.
Size - Not usually a major concern because the vast majority of guitar straps are adjustable, but you'll still want to be sure the strap is at least long enough to allow comfortable playing while standing up.
Padding - Some guitar straps incorporate padding into the part of the strap that is slung over your shoulder to make playing more comfortable. This is usually made from foam, but sometimes fur or other materials are used.
Aesthetics - Guitar straps come in a huge variety of colors and designs. Pick one that's right for your ""sound"".;
, Guitar straps typically have leather (or fake leather) ends in the shape of rounded triangles. On each end should be a small hole with a slit cut in the side of it. These holes will support the weight of your guitar while you play.

, Almost all electric guitars have two small knobs that fit into the holes on the strap. The first of these is at the base of the guitar's body - in other words, if you stand the guitar up vertically, it will be at the ""bottom"" of the guitar. This knob typically sticks out about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) depending on what type of guitar you have. Slip the hole that is farther from the strap's belt-like tightening/loosening buckle over this knob.









To ensure comfort during playing, ensure that you slip the strap hole over the knob so that the fitting buckle faces outwards - otherwise, it may dig into your shoulder.

, Look at the spot where the neck of the guitar meets the body. Nearly all electric guitars will have a knob near here. Slip the second strap-hole - the one that's closer to the buckle used to adjust the strap - over this knob. Put the other end of the strap on this knob.








, Congratulations - your guitar is now ""strapped up"". Now, it's time to test out the strap. If you are right-handed, sling the strap over your left shoulder so that the guitar hangs in front of you, allowing you to strum with your right hand and fret with your left. If you are left-handed, do the reverse - sling the strap over your right shoulder.








, Now, ensure your strap fits comfortably and doesn't inhibit your movement by playing a few simple chords or songs. Try playing in a variety of ways - standing up, sitting down, and even kneeling or laying down, for instance.

, When you play with a strap, you want your playing to come as easily and as naturally as it would without one. This means that your strap should allow the guitar to hang at such a height that you can strum and fret as you normally would. Use the strap's adjustable buckle to change the length of the strap as needed for your comfort and ease of playing.








"
"
Grab a short length of string.,
Attach one end of the strap to the knob at the base of the guitar.,
Slip the string through the hole at the other end of the strap.,
Slip the string under the strings and around the headstock.,
Secure the string with a sturdy knot.,
Test your strap and adjust as necessary.,
Install a second knob at your own risk.",How to Put a Strap On a Guitar2," Unlike electrics, most acoustic guitars only have one knob to hook the strap onto. Because of this, you'll usually need to use a piece of string or twine to tie one end of the strap to the headstock. This string can be made from virtually anything as long as it's thin enough to fit under the strings behind the nut.


If you don't have any string handy, try using an old shoelace - they're usually about the right length and thickness and are surprisingly durable.

, The first part of putting a strap on an acoustic guitar is the same as for an electric. Slide the hole on the end of the strap that is farther from the buckle onto the knob at the base of the body of the acoustic.









As above, be sure to orient the strap so that the buckle faces outward and doesn't dig into your shoulder while playing.

, Because the acoustic guitar has only one knob, the other end must be tied to the headstock. Begin by passing the string through the hole that isn't currently attached to the guitar's knob (the hole at the end of the strap closer to the buckle).








, Take one end of your string and pass it under the strings just behind the nut (the wood or plastic piece at the far end of the fretboard that keeps the strings separated). Bring the end of the string under and around the headstock. The string should ideally rest just behind the nut.








, Next, tie the ends of your string together. If your string is exceptionally long, you may want to ""double it up"" to reduce the distance between the strap and the headstock. Use a strong knot (or knots) - you don't want this string to come untied while you're playing.

, Congratulations - your acoustic guitar is now ready to play! Test your strap out by playing in a variety of positions (as above). Use the buckle to make adjustments to the length of the strap as necessary. Listen to the sound of your notes - the string tied around the headstock shouldn't muffle or otherwise interfere with the normal vibrations of the strings in any way.


If the length of the string is too long or short to allow for comfortable playing, you may need to untie it and adjust it to a suitable length.

, Rather than tie their strap to the headstock, some guitarists choose to install a second knob on their acoustic guitar. Usually, the knob is installed where the neck meets the body (to mimic the arrangement of knobs on an electric). Only attempt this if you have experience modifying guitars. Doing this incorrectly can permanently damage the guitar by splitting its wood.

Pick up strap locks at your local music store.,
Install basic plastic locks by putting them over the knob and twisting.,
Use a set of metal locks for added security.,
Improvise a set of strap locks by using rubber washers.",How to Put a Strap On a Guitar3," One commonly-used strap accessory that can potentially save you major headaches (not to mention lots of cash) is the strap lock. Strap locks usually take the form of simple plastic or metal caps that slide over the guitar's knobs after you've put them through the holes in the strap. These handy tools keep the guitar from falling out of its strap while you're playing, potentially preventing permanent damage and/or hundreds of dollars in repairs. Best of all, they're available in a wide variety of styles at most local music stores for quite cheap - often just a few dollars!

, Normal, inexpensive plastic strap locks usually take the form of small discs with holes in the middle and a set of ridges on a rotating upper portion. These can be installed by pushing the guitar knob through the central hole and using the ridges to twist the lock into place. After doing this for each knob, the strap should remain in place no matter how you twist or pull it while playing.








, The ""premium"" option when it comes to strap locks is a special set of interlocking metal fasteners. This type of strap lock is a little more expensive than basic plastic options and requires you to modify both your guitar and your strap, but offers total protection from slippage. To use this type of strap lock, you'll need to remove the knobs from your guitar and install new ones that are specially designed to interface with the lock. You'll also need to secure the locking mechanism inside holes of your guitar strap. When everything is in place, the locks should ""click"" into place on the knobs. Once locked, the strap can't be removed except by deliberately pulling the release on each lock.

, Though strap locks are generally fairly cheap, there are free alternatives. For instance, one easy trick is to place a tight-fitting rubber washer over the top of each knob after placing the strap on the guitar. The rubber washer will hold the strap in place while playing, making it more difficult (but not impossible) for the strap to fall off of the guitar.


You can find rubber washers at your local hardware store - you'll usually want the 5/16"" variety. Alternatively, if you drink beer or soda that comes in an old-fashioned bottle with a locking cap, you can remove the washer from the underside of the cap and use it for this purpose.

Know the square grid in the diagram represents frets and six strings.,
Note where the chord starts.,
Number your fingers to match the chord diagrams.,
Pay attention to barre chords noted by a thick line across the frets.,
Know which open strings to play and which to ignore.",How to Read Chord Diagrams," The grid represents the neck of your guitar, and the thick horizontal line at the top represents the nut of the instrument, which is located at the top of the fret board next to the head. The horizontal lines represent frets while the vertical lines represent strings.


The leftmost vertical line is the sixth string (the thickest string), while the rightmost one represents the first string (the thinnest string).;
, The first position chords are based at the nut of the instrument and have the most open strings. However, if there is a small number to the upper right of the diagram, this means you start the chord at the fret noted by the number. The top of the diagram would be the fret -- so if there is an 8, the top of the diagram is the 8th fret. The letter at the top of the chart is the name of the chord.








, The dots on the strings indicate the string and fret location. One string vibrating by itself is called a note. When multiple strings are vibrating at different frequencies, the sound produced is called a chord. Furthermore, the numbers inside the dots tell you which finger to use for fretting, making finding the chord even easier.









1 - Pointer finger
2 - Middle finger
3 - Ring finger
4 - Little finger
T - Thumb

, If there is a thick, horizontal line across the frets, this means that the same finger is barred across multiple strings. This is done for barre chords and some complex jazz fingerings. You start your tip of the finger at the farthest left fret on the diagram, then use the ""body"" of your finger to fret the other strings beneath it.

, The X above the nut indicates a string that is not used. Either mute the string with an unused finger or don't strum it. The O above the nut indicates a string that is played open, meaning no finger is pressed on that string.









Black or differently colored dots often indicate the ""root note."" This is the dominant note in the chord. For an A-major chord, for example, the root note would be an A. There are often multiple of the same root note in one chord.

Develop a 3-5 note lick that you enjoy and fits the song.,
Separate your theme with spaces, further runs up the scale, or chords.,
Vary up the theme slightly each time you play it, usually focusing on the ending.,
Return to the theme to bring the song full circle.,
Teach other instruments the theme for classic call and response playing.,
Set the theme up before, and after, the solo.",How to Repeat Themes in Guitar Solos," This will be your theme, and there is no ""wrong"" way to pick one. Some guitarists make up something new, improvising over the key of the song until a lick catches their ear. Others mimic the melody of the singer, or another instrument, changing it slightly to keep the song cohesive. Still others have a series of single notes, chords, or small licks that they have memorized, ready to use if they get stuck or can't think of notes to play.









Not all solos need a repeated theme. This is more of a technique in your arsenal than a blueprint for every solo you play.;
, A theme needs to come in only occasionally, never overstaying its welcome or becoming too predictable. As such, you need to show some discipline when restating the theme. At the very least, make sure there is some other part of the solo in between each theme.









A little pause after the theme, letting it stand alone before launching back into the solo, is a great way to give it emphasis and create space naturally.

, The theme should not be played perfectly each time. Slight variations will give it fresh life, taking your listeners just off-guard enough to pleasantly surprise them. Use the theme as a springboard, taking the last 2-3 notes and adjusting them into something new to keep your solo fresh and novel.









As long as you stick to the same basic set of notes, there is no limit to the number of changes you can put your theme through. Experimentation is key.

, If you're using repeated themes in your solo, a great way to wrap everything up is one last return to the theme. Truly slick guitarists can find a way to sneak into the theme at the ending, having it appear almost by surprise to cap off the song triumphantly. This, of course, is only possible if you know exactly how the theme fits into your scale. This makes it a great way to show how intelligent of a guitarist you've become.








, Who says the guitarist is the only one who need to know the theme? If you can get a piano, singer, bass, or saxophone to play the theme, you can sit out a bar, then ""respond"" to your own theme with a new lick of your own. Trading the theme back and forth, too, is a great way to add a new section to a song or solo.








, If you've used the theme before in the chorus and/or verse, you've prepped the audience for the wild departures and quick changes in the solo. The theme is already in their ears, giving you more chances to play with it later. Furthermore, using the theme after the solo is a good way to keep the energy and feel of the song high after you've stopped playing.









That said, people frequently over-use the theme, playing it so often it becomes obvious and boring. Find 1-2 spots in the song to place it, and no more."

Realize that most live disasters happen when you are ill prepared for the rigors of a gig.,
Have plenty of picks.,
Bring a Back Up Guitar.,
Secure your patch cord.",How to Prepare Your Guitar for a Gig3," Here are some tips gleaned from experience.

, No one likes to be the guitarist searching the murky stage for his or her dropped pick while the rest of the band is thrashing on. To avoid this, you should have at least three picks on the ready when you begin a song. There are many devices you can buy to store picks on your guitar.

, Even though you just changed the strings on your main guitar, try to bring an extra guitar as a back up. Make sure it is in tune and ready to go at a moments notice. The benefits to having a back up ready are countless. Break a string? Grab the back up. Your main guitar going out of tune with one song left? Grab the back up. Using an alternate tuning during the set? Grab the back up tuned to the desired pitch. Electronics in the body of your main guitar kick the bucket? Grab the back up. You get the idea...

, An unsecured patch cord is the number 1 way to damage the output of your guitar and your chances of having a good show. Do yourself a favor and secure it.


Take the tip of the patch cord in your right hand and pull it through the space between the strap and your guitar from behind and plug it into the guitar.
What you should have now is the patch cord running from behind firmly seated between the butt of the guitar and your strap and then plugged into your guitars output. Leave a small amount of patch cord hanging to prevent pressure on the guitars output.
If you are a little puzzled, go and check out pictures of professionals playing their guitar using patch cords. They all use this method.

Understand that having to play the remainder of a song holding up your axe because your strap popped off is unacceptable.,
Using a screwdriver, remove the strap buttons on from the guitar.,
Go to a hardware store and buy two thin metal washers that are at least 3/4"" in diameter but no larger than 1 1/4"".,

Find a bath big enough to comfortably take your horn and line it with an old sheet or towels.,
Fill the bath with lukewarm water.

,
Remove all slides, mouthpiece and any other moving parts from the horn.,
Submerge the horn completely in water and press down all valves to open them (just a couple of times, you don't need to keep them down.),
Leave the horn for an hour to around three hours (only if it is an instrument that hasn't been bathed in a very long time, or if the valves are stuck down.),
Get a snake to clean the horn.,
Finish cleaning.,
Remove your horn carefully from the bath and tip all the water sitting inside of it out.,
Dry the horn.,
Wait a few hours then tip your horn out again to remove any water that has settled.

,
Pour some low-viscosity valve oil down the slides into the valves, and oil all the bearings and rotors.

,
Re-grease all slides and replace them.

,
If you have a detachable bell, use graphite from a pencil as lubricant for the threads.

",How to Bathe a French Horn," (This prevents damage to horn and bath.);
,, (If it has a detachable bell, remove this.)

,

,

, While the horn is soaking, use a pull-through (snake) to clean out all your slides in a separate sink. If the pull-through is too wide to get round the bends in the slide, don't force it. It will get stuck and just cause damage. Try a trumpet or clarinet-style pull through instead. Use a mouthpiece brush to clean out your mouthpiece just now as well - no point in blowing all your mouthpiece gunk down into your nice clean horn!

, Now for the nasty bit. When bath-time is almost up, put your pull-through through your lead-pipe (from mouthpiece end to tuning slide) and then use either the end of your pull-through or a similar smaller brush to clean out all the valve-slides.

, You should be able to hear any water sloshing around inside but if you are having trouble getting it out try depressing all the valves and tipping the horn round 360 degrees towards the bell - any water should come out of the bell!

, After making sure you have gotten rid of any water sitting in the valves, lay your horn on some towels or another clean sheet to dry. Remove any surface water with a clean cloth or towel and then leave the horn, preferably in a room with some circulating air for a few hours to dry out.

Think of the reasons why you don't like your other musical instrument(s).,
Play your guitar for some time and think of the things that you want else or changed.,
Research.",How to Purchase a Guitar for Your Career1," Is it too much of a beginner's guitar for you? Does the body shape throw you off when you play? Does it not just feel right playing it even though you like the action and the strings on it? Finding out why you don't like a certain instrument will influence you to buy something updated or completely different. It will be the main cause and effect throughout your entire buying process by swinging your wants to needs of certain features that will influence your music and your buying guide.;
, An example would be neck shape for some, you may like the C-shape but you may find that a V can give you a better piece of mind when playing. It would be a good habit to have that you need to be picky about your options, since you play the guitar you like and no one else does.

, Find out by demoing guitars or weighing certain options (from playing a similar built guitar) about what it is that you like about that certain guitar, why you like playing it, and why you would want to play it time and time again. You can also search guitars to see what kind of aesthetic properties they have over the Internet, but to really get a good solid understanding of what you want and what you need need is always best achieved by trying out different guitars.

If you have a warped neck or major truss rod repair, obtain a genuine replacement neck be it the neck alone or from a donor guitar with a thrashed body beyond restoration.;
, What kind of tuners you purchase is entirely your choice and also how they are arranged. Les Paul and other similar headstock are called 3 x 3, three tuners on one side and three on the other and normally are in a different orientation than 6-in-line tuners on a Stratocaster type of headstock. In the event you have a different setup involving an uneven number of tuners, find that same exact set in the same orientation. You can also use in-line tuners but they will be left or right depending on how you play, but you are able to tune normally.

, If necessary, replace your nut with any material of your choice. Many times a Les Paul nut type will break at both E strings because of string tension forcing pressure to break the nut. Also, the nut may break or has broken because of dry rot to the material or any defective pieces. None less it's broken and will need to be replaced, start with obtaining a new nut that is anything to your liking, preferably a blank nut rather than a precut to avoid improper string height. If cutting a blank try copying your old nut and make adjustments if needed using the neck as a guide after cutting out the nut. To do this take a sharp blade that is easy to work with such as an X-acto and cut the finish that holds the sides of the nut. Make sure to cut all of the finish as it will break apart when you take out the nut. Next, using a striking tool such as a regular screwdriver and a hammer gently tap out the nut. When the new nut is ready to be placed in, mix together a small amount of water and wood glue (50% glue/ 50% water) and coat the bottom of the nut cut in the neck and fit in the nut.

, Be very cautious when trying to do this if you don't have experience and always tape or protect your fingerboard until you have gained enough skill. When trying to find high frets, mark each one with a permanent marker and then take a sanding block that has 120 grit sandpaper and simply sand off the marker. If the maker comes off early that's a high fret, if it doesn't come off that's a low fret, if a bundle comes off those are properly placed frets. If you need to detangle frets use a series of files and carefully scrape across the neck in the angle of the fret ends. Always reference other tutorials for dressing frets or replacing them.

, If the screw holes in your neck are stripped or are larger than the threads, place in pre-glued toothpicks or scraps of wood and how many depending on what you need into the hole and wait for it to dry, then try re-threading the hole by screwing in the bolt.

, These wings form the main body shape and may have been broken by dropping the guitar or other damaging methods. If you do not properly glue in the wings you will need to use extra caution as to not break the bond. Repairing wings or any body wood is rarely necessary, especially on a thick guitar body such as a Les Paul Standard. It may be needed on a smaller bodied guitar much like a Les Paul Junior.

, Many times strap buttons become loose and eventually come out. Use the same method as rearing a bolt on neck hole mentioned above, be careful not to over-tighten any screw and always use an appropriate screwdriver.

, Rarely does this occur but sometimes if an inexperienced tinkerer had stripped the Tune-O-Matic and/or stop-bar you will need to follow the same method as to repairing a strap button.

, Sometimes a neck joint can break at the sides or at other cuts and if this happens repair them properly and the same method as repairing body wings. If the bottom of the joint where the screws bolt on is damaged in any way then you must repair the body properly or replace it entirely.

, You do not have the option of repairing and salvaging the pickup beyond re soldering the coil wire. If you do this be aware you are not repairing but instead customizing. However, to repair or restore pickups start by re-magnetize the coil magnets using strong earth magnets. If you need to re-solder the coil wire, unwind the pickup tape and properly re-solder in the wire appropriately.

, To clean switches use solvent such as contact cleaner in a spray into the toggle itself, you may also use other solvents such as WD-40, always work the solvent around by using the switch as indented. To replace switches first obtain a proper switch that applies with your guitar, then soldering in accordingly. Work in a well-ventilated space to avoid harmful fumes from solder or solvents.

, To clean pots use solvents such as contact cleaner or other solvents in a spray can and spray into the small indent on the base of the pot, always work the solvent around by using the switch as invented. To replace pots first obtain a similar pot that applies with your guitar that has the same reading (usually 50k in ohms, written on the ground plate), then soldering in abidingly. Work in well-ventilated space to avoid harmful fumes from solder or solvents.

, To clean jacks use solvents such as contact cleaner or other solvents as a spray and spray the metal parts, clean any excess solvent with a rag. To replace jacks first obtain a similar one that complies with your guitar, then soldering in properly. Work in well-ventilated space to avoid harmful fumes from solder or solvents.

, Plated or painted bridges and stop-bars (gold plate, black painted, and similar) should be cleaned with non-abrasive means such as using plain water and a microfiber towel to dry and remove spots. Chrome and non-plated metal can be restored to a shine with fine steel wool (0000 grade).

, These rings are usually plastic and cannot be restored but covers are normally metal on Les Paul styles. You may not want to rub steel wool across your covers so follow the method of cleaning painted bridges to avoid unwanted scratches. Also, replace your pickup rings properly with rings that are the same length and/or color and make sure the screw holes do not need to be resized.

, Knobs are covers for your pots so you can easily turn them, if any of your knobs are unable to be correctly placed on try due to broken or enlarge holes, place a good amount of tape around the pot's shaft that covers it and try to keep the the knob on the tape. If you cannot do so then you may need to replace your knobs.

, These are the plastic or metal covers that hold the jack and tells you witch switch is treble or rhythm. The switch cannot be repaired and will need to be replaced, however, a metal jack plate can never break and only will need to be cleaned. A plastic plate will need to be replaced or the screw holes need to be resized, do so properly and make sure every fastener is snug including screws and nuts."

Use a tuning instrument to play an F above middle C. Tune your horn to match the arrangement in which you’re playing.,

Tune the horn’s closed notes.,
Ensure you have enough coverage with your hand in the bell.,
Mark your tuning slides with a soft-leaded pencil.,
Be ready to compromise.",How to Tune a French Horn1," A single horn generally has one main tuning slide. To locate this tuning slide, follow the tubing of your horn from the mouthpiece until you arrive at a tuning slide. This is your main tuning slide.


If your horn has more than one tuning slide, you likely have a double horn and you will also need to adjust the B flat tuning slide.;
, Play your instrument for at least 3 to 5 minutes, going through scales or practicing musical and fingering patterns or even just blowing warm air through the instrument, a cold instrument never plays as well, this is all to warm up your own playing as well as the instrument. Also cold air temperature will make an instrument react and play differently, tending towards playing flat. The instrument will also warm up as you play, and the tone will shift slightly and become more predictable., In order to match the tune that the rest of the orchestra or ensemble is playing, match your tone to a consistent tuner (usually the oboe), it is best if the other hornists in your ensemble are there and you can all match the same pitch. Alternately, use a bar or electric tuner, tuning fork or even a well tuned piano..

, The approximate position for the main tuning slide is about ¼ inch to ½ inch out. With the tuning slide all the way in, the notes should sound sharp, with it all the way to it is flat. You can listen to your tuner's pitch and yours to determine if you are sharp or flat.

, If the piano is playing F above middle C, play the corresponding open note (meaning there are no valves being pressed). Play the third C that would correspond with the middle C on a “horn in F.”, You will want to tune the horn to match the sounds that will emerge when you play it in performance. Keep the positioning and size of your hand’s coverage in the bell consistent as you tune.

, As you play this open note with the piano or other tuning instrument, you will hear if your note is flat (below the note) or sharp (above the note). Pull the tuning slide out to draw down sharp tones, or push the slide in to push up flat notes. It might take practice to hear if your pitch is right or wrong, it is a difference but it seems small at first Even though these are minor adjustments, they do impact how much air must travel through the horn and therefore impact how the tone sounds.

, If you are playing a double horn, your next step is to tune the horn so that it’s in tune with itself.Press the thumb valve to switch over to the horn’s B flat side. Play F again above middle C on piano. Slide between the F and Bb on the horn. Leave the main tuning slide alone and only adjust the Bb tuning slide the same way as the F slide.

, You have now tuned the open note (notes played with no valves pressed down). Now you need to tune closed notes, or those that are played while pressing valves down. You can use an electronic tuner, piano, tuning fork, or similar instrument to help you, but you can also use your ear to listen for sharp or flat notes.


Play your middle C, which you just tuned. This should be perfectly in pitch now.
Play either fourths, fifths or an octave above the tuned middle C for each valve. For example, to tune first valve, play F above your middle C. It is much easier to compare notes with middle C and hear the intonation between notes that are distant from each other, such as an octave apart.
Adjust the valve tuner for each valve note you play to sharpen or flatten the note. To sharpen, push the slide valve tuner in. To flatten, slide the valve tuner out.
Repeat for each valve.For a double horn, you should have six valves (three on the F side and three on the B flat side).

, If you have pulled out all the tuning slides and the horn is still sounding too sharp, then you likely need to provide more coverage with your right hand inside the horn’s bell. Similarly, if you have pushed in the slides all the way and you are still flat, then you will need to adjust how much of your hand is inside the bell, instead making the coverage area smaller., Mark the slides after you’ve tuned and adjusted the slide. This will give you a good indication of where the slide should sit to be in tune, although you will still need to tune your horn in comparison to the other instruments with which you are playing.


Marking your slides is especially useful for when you need to empty condensation or saliva from the horn in the middle of a performance. Emptying condensation will usually throw off the pitch a bit. To offset this, make sure you take note of where you’ve put the valve mark so you can return the tuning slide to the correct location quickly. Alternately, you can measure where the tuning slide sits with your fingernail or knuckle and easily return the slide to its proper location after emptying condensation.

, The complexity of the French horn is such that you cannot achieve perfect pitch for every note. You will need to compromise by choosing the middle ground on tuning."
"
Change your embouchure.,
Move your right hand in the horn’s bell.,
Change your mouthpiece.,
Practice frequently to learn proper pitch.,
Play with an ensemble.",How to Tune a French Horn2," Your embouchure is your mouth position and movement through which air flows into the horn’s mouthpiece. Using muscle control and air flow through the instrument, you can bend a note up or down to align it into tune more accurately. You can also adjust your lips or tongue to achieve slightly different pitches of the same note., The pitch of your horn changes depending on the placement of your hand in the bell.If you have small hands and a large bell, this can be problematic to cover enough of the bell to achieve good pitch. Similarly, larger-than-norrmal hands can also cause problems. Find a horn with a good fit for you. Test out the placement of your hand to adjust the pitch. More hand coverage will make tone flatter. Less hand coverage will make tone sharper.You can also use a tuning sleeve, which is like a cork or a bit of extra hand coverage. This will provide consistent and even coverage of the bell, which can help with pitch changes., Mouthpieces are available in various cup sizes and shapes, and various rim widths, sizes and shapes. Selecting a different mouthpiece may enable you to reach new sounds or play with better tonal quality. If you have a mouth that is smaller or larger than average, this can impact how you play and you should adjust your mouthpiece accordingly.You can also pull out or push in the mouthpiece slightly to adjust the pitch., Learning more about the horn, practicing consistently and often, and listening to others play the horn will give you a good sense of what sounds right.Practice with an electronic tuner to see how accurately your ear hears a note’s pitch. Play an open note without looking at the tuner and make adjustments to get the note into tune. Then check with the electronic tuner to see how close you are to the accurate pitch. Make an adjustment to align with the tuner and listen to how that note sounds.

, This will help you stay in pitch more so than if you play solo. You can adjust your tone to match your fellow players. You can also hide an out-of-tune note a little more easily when you play with others.

Do not eat or drink anything while playing the horn.,
Maintain the valves on a weekly basis.,
Clean the horn regularly.",How to Tune a French Horn3," This is a complex and expensive instrument, and even minor damage can affect how it plays and the quality of its tone. Don’t eat or drink anything, especially sugary soda or candy, just before or during when you will play the instrument. This can damage the horn. It is a good idea to brush your teeth before playing the horn to ensure that there is no transfer of food into the horn.

, Keep your instrument in good condition by maintaining its moving parts frequently. To oil the valves, use a valve oil or rotor oil (available at a music shop) under the valve caps, along the bearing, and along the valve springs. Also, run warm, soapy water through the valves once a month to clean out any build-up. Wipe the valves clean and dry with a soft cloth. Grease the valves with a slide lubricant., The outside of the horn will get coated with oils from fingers, while the inside will become coated with saliva and other moisture. This can contribute to a potential build-up of mold or other growths, thereby impacting the quality of the horn’s sound and the longevity of the instrument itself. Clean the inside of the horn by washing out the tubes periodically. Use warm soapy water to flush out the tubes, which will clean out any built-up saliva and moisture. Rinse carefully with warm clear water and dry the instrument with a soft cloth.

Apply yourself.,
Don't be afraid to make it big when the time comes to make a big decision, such as applying for music school.",How to Become a Virtuoso Hornist," Are you really ready to go on professionally? You can ask yourself this even if you're in high school. It's never too early to start. You just need to have it in you. Make sure you have been studying seriously so far and have gotten at least more than skin deep into horn playing.;
,

The ability to do lip trills.
Flexibility between the extreme high and low ranges that includes proper dropping of the jaw in the low range.
Skill in transposing from Horn in E, Eb, D, C, Bb, A, G, and even Db, Ab, and B for the occasional Verdi and Brahms repertoire that require those keys.
These three skills are essential for the aspiring virtuoso, whether your aspiration is to be a horn soloist or an orchestral player.







, In this path you take, you'll be hearing a lot of technique correcting. People have gone through several teachers telling them how to play horn, and eventually you'll fall into a style that is overall correct, but make sure you take high quality lessons from a good, professional teacher who is actively playing in groups and has a good standing. Don't be afraid to ask for their resume. Better to pay for a well rounded experienced and active musician than a secondary school teacher who only plays horn once in a blue moon.

A good example of accepting change is realizing how many different ways your right hand can be in the bell, rather than trying to figure out one perfect way that doesn't exist.







, Start asking for CDs of horn players for Christmas. Get your hands on recordings of Dennis Brain, Barry Tuckwell, Roland Berger, Michael Thompson, Hermann Baumann, Eric Ruske, etc. Also, look up very well known horn players, and listen to their music and study their technique. Pick one to be your role model, and even pretend to be that horn player while you play. It can help confidence. Listen to a lot of music. This is essential in developing your own tonal concept.

, Have a pile of concertos, excerpts, etude books, etc. You'll want plenty of materials to have while studying in graduate school and such. The more you know about musically, the better. It's not a bad idea to know Horn in concert H means ""concert B natural"" either.

, Practice as much as you can. Now, here's the big thing: don't think you're great because you practice 10 hours a day. It's always quality over quantity. Ask yourself: did you play well? Did you accomplish something? What did you accomplish? Never ever expect 2 hours of tooting random notes will get you anywhere.

, Get out there and perform. It doesn't matter if there's no work, make work. Try going to a church every week and play a new piece weekly for them. Teach the rest of your horn section during high school, relaying things you've learned. Get involved with regional competitions, local gigs, set up a brass quintet with some friends, etc.

, Audition for Julliard, Curtis, and other prestigious schools. Try out for the NY Philharmonic, Boston Symphony, or the Trans-Siberian Orchestra. If you don't dream big, you won't go big. You'll face some pretty tough failures in your life (rejection from Julliard after putting all this work into it) as well as some great successes (scholarships, job offers, etc). Just go for it!

Work on exercises.",How to Hit Low Notes on a French Horn," This is a fundamental that cannot be stressed enough. If you are playing on a brand new, five hundred dollar horn, your tone, in general, will sound thin, your range will be small, and you will have a much harder time playing the instrument than you should. This is unfortunate because most beginning horn players start off, at least, on cheap, school-owned horns. There is no reason to put yourself in this position unless you have no other option. Horn is easiest to play when you are playing on a quality horn. If you are afraid that it really is the instrument that is holding you back from reaching a full, lovely low register, then shop around. Go to pawn shops, in particular, you will be surprised what you can find for a bargain. Used horns have a much more mature and dark sound than new horns, which is why many horns from the 1960s and 1970s sell for a great deal more than their current models do.;
, Again, this is a factor that is completely in your control that doesn't take any time at all to correct. If you can, take your horn in to be professionally cleaned- for less than fifty dollars, your horn can be electronically cleaned from the inside out, and will sound better than it has in years. If possible, do this on a yearly basis, so as to not give dirt time to build up inside the horn. If this is not possible for you, use warm soapy water and a dishcloth to clean it yourself.

, This is a personal thing- what may work for one player won't work for another. Basically try to look for a mouthpiece with a good, deep cup, a decently sized rim. Beyond that, it needs to be a personal thing, but don't expect the mouthpiece that just happened to be in the case with your horn to automatically be the one for you.

, While it doesn't take much time to figure the fingerings out on your own time, it's still important to know the proper, in-tune fingerings. The list below assumes that you are playing on a double horn. If you are playing on a single horn in F, play the fingerings for the notes that do not include T (trigger). You'll notice there is a large gap in the pitches you can hit. Unfortunately, that is the nature of the single horn in this register. Also, since the Bb side is shorter, they will have a quicker response but tend to be sharper. The beginning note for this list is the G below the C below the staff.

, While maybe not terribly important for actually hitting the low notes, this is important for having the notes that you can/do hit coming out in tune. Hold your right hand as if you were trying to hold a very small amount of water in your palm (forming a small cup) with your fingers all together. Place it inside the bell. Everyone has their own opinion on where, exactly, you hand needs to be in the bell, but, again, it really is a matter of personal preference. Listen to how your horn sounds with your right hand in different places and go with whatever sounds right, makes the horn the most in tune, and is comfortable for you. When it comes to tune individual notes, moving this hand is a lot easier than adjusting the slides.

, Hitting low notes on the horn requires a huge amount of air. If you are stooped or twisted when playing the horn, your lungs will not reach their full capacity and your air flow will be impacted negatively. You need to sit up straight with your back away from the back of your chair. Many people like to play with their legs sprawled apart, others prefer to sit with their feet together- this doesn't impact your air flow or playing ability, so sit however you feel comfortable.

, Ideally, you want about two thirds of the lip in your mouthpiece to be upper lip, while the other third to be your lower lip. This is opposite from what a trumpet player should have, with one third and two thirds, respectively, which often leads to low register problems with horn players who have transferred from trumpet. When you need to hit low notes, you will need to drop your jaw dramatically (this should look akin to dropping your jaw to put a gumball in your mouth), which will, naturally, reduce the amount of bottom lip in the mouthpiece slightly.

, This should be a note you can hit any day of any week- G in the staff or E on the staff, for example. Work down chromatically from this note. Keep in mind that you need to use more air as you work down; take breaks for air frequently, and don't go too quickly. Keep your diaphragm strong but don't tense up your shoulders or throat. Resist the temptation to play quieter as you go lower; this will result in your lips giving out before they would have otherwise. When you reach your breaking point, {i}stop playing{/i}.

, This time, start lower. Rather than G or E in the staff, start off on A or G below the staff. Work down chromatically, paying careful attention to keeping your airstream strong. You should literally feel like you are forcing the air into the horn using your diaphragm. When you reach your breaking point, stop playing.

, Start even lower this time. If you keep this process up for about half an hour every day (because you practice three or four hours a day as you should, right?), you should see marked improvement in your tone and ability to hit low notes on the horn.

, Some useful ones are the Carmine Caruso exercises. Look up other specific low horn Exercises to target range shifts, centering the notes, and tone. This is something you might not have thought of- once you have a basic grasp of low notes on your horn, and can actually hit them more times than not, work these notes into your everyday playing. Your range doesn't include your lowest register unless you can include it in your playing with ease.

(Optional) Take a nickel and stick it in the hole that you just cut. Make sure it is all the way in and won't come out and become lodged into your trumpet/trombone.
Also make sure that you stick it in so that it's not closing up the hole, but so it is like a wall in the middle of it. This will give your plunger more of a buzzing sound.

Assemble the trombone by carefully placing the screw-end of the bell section to the screw end of the slide and twist to form a right angle then from here adjust to your hand size, with the bell facing away from you making sure that when you hold it the bell is on the left.,
Hold the assembled trombone by supporting the tubing around the screw-joint with the left hand and putting your right hand on the movable part of the slide.,
Pick up the trombone.,
Keep your body centered when playing.,
To make sound come out of the instrument, you need to make an 'o' shape with your lips, the corners tight, leaving the centre of your lips loose.,
To play higher pitched notes, you must make your lips tighter, your jaw should raise naturally and your air blowing in a more downward motion.,
To play lower notes, you need to loosen the centre of your lips and drop your jaw.,
If you have never played a brass instrument before this could be challenging.,
If you want to learn more than just how to mess about with it, there are seven positions for the slide.,
Increase your range of notes by practicing regularly (preferably once a day for at least half an hour) and increase your lip flexibility by moving from one note to a higher one and back, gradually getting faster, and trying to keep an even sound.,
Increase your lung capacity.",How to Play the Trombone," Tighten the thumbscrew. Place the mouthpiece in the remaining tube end on the slide. Twist the mouthpiece gently into the lead-pipe. Don't force or push the mouthpiece in because it can cause the mouthpiece to become stuck. It makes a cool noise when you pop it with the palm of your hand, however, the mouthpiece will become stuck and require a special tool to unstick it.







;
, Make sure the slide is ""locked"". If you aren't playing the horn, it should locked otherwise the slide can fall off with a damaging and embarrassing clatter. This is very important because the slide is everything on a 'slide trombone'. One small dint in the slide can cause it to become stuck and unmovable.








, If you are right-handed, you need to make a gun with your left hand and have your index finger touching the mouthpiece and your thumb around the bar right by it. Your other three fingers should not be in the same space as your index but one over. To hold the slide all you are doing is gently pinioning the slide with the tips of your index and middle fingers and your thumb.








, This allows for a less restricted chest and stomach, allowing your diaphragm fill up with more air then when you are slouched and allow for a faster intake of breath. If you are sitting, against what a lot of non brass oriented music teachers will tell you, trombonists need to sit as far back in the chair as possible, making sure you sit up against the back of the chair and are not slouched. By sitting on the edge of your seat (like most music teachers tell you) you will be restricting the air flow from your lunges. Your feet should be planted firmly on the ground, still remaining centered.









, Before you can make a decent sound through the instrument, it is best to practice making the 'buzz' sound without the mouthpiece. To do that, you need to keep your lips tight and blow fast, even air, as if blowing a raspberry on your own arm. Remember, this will be instantly easier with the mouthpiece. Note: Do NOT puff your cheeks out when playing, you will become short of breath quickly, and your note will effectively be rough and spluttered.








, In order to do that, pull back the corners of your mouth engaging them and making them more firm as you play higher. Also make sure that you stay relaxed when playing higher and blow faster air through the instrument, don't make any weird faces that would cause tension in the sound.








, Your air still needs to remain somewhat fast and definitely steady, but there needs to be a lot more, to maintain a good quality sound. Trombones, especially bass trombones or tenor trombones with trigger attachments, need a lot more air to play a well supported note because of all the extra tubing. When you first start playing the lower register, it may be very challenging. To do well, increasing your lung capacity is the key.









, To play louder, blow harder and more ""openly."" (Note: It will feel natural to press against the mouthpiece for higher notes. Resist this temptation, as it will lead to problems later.) Playing 'openly' does not mean loosening your lips. It means dropping your jaw and somewhat parting your lips to achieve a rounder, brassier sound.








,










First position, the slide is almost all the way in. (Make sure when returning to first position you do not slam the slide in).
Third position is slightly after the bell, but will vary depending on the register in which the note is played.
Second position is a little more than halfway between 1st and 3rd. Again, this position will vary. The higher the note, the higher the slide tends to need to be.
Fourth is just past the bell.
Sixth is ""almost"" all of the way out. Fifth is between fourth and sixth.
Seventh is all of the way out. On most trombones, there is a 'lip' or marking where seventh position is, due to the end of the trombone being slightly after, this is to allow for players with long arms.
The positions may vary slightly for the instrument you play for there are five different types of trombones. Soprano and Alto Trombones are smaller then the regular, so the slide positions won't be far apart. Bass and Contrabass Trombones are much larger. The bass trombone used to be quite a deal longer than the tenor or 'normal' Trombone. Now days, most have a double trigger system attached to them. It is rare to find an old fashioned Bass Trombone. Contrabass trombones are much the same except a deal larger.

, Improve how long you can hold your breath by practicing long notes. Scales are an important exercise to do regularly, increasing from one octave upwards. Remember, trombone technique workbooks are available from most music stores. if you are serious about learning to play the Trombone, it is recommended to check them out.








, To do this there are different techniques or activities you can do. Get in shape. Run. Bicycle. Swim. Any cardiovascular activity will benefit your playing. Not only that, but breathing exercises help as well. If you can't breathe properly, you won't be able to get a well supported note out of the instrument for long periods of time. There are many exercises you can check out on the internet and in workbooks. Have a browse.

Disassemble the trombone by unscrewing the bell portion from the slide and removing the mouthpiece.,
Remove the outer slide and wipe off any excess grease, oil or moisture from the inner slides with a soft rag.,
Use a cleaning rod or a “snake” (a flexible rubber coated metal wire with a small brush on both ends), clean out any excess grease, oil or moisture from the insides of the outer and inner slides.,

, Be careful not to bend or dent either slide in the process. Be gentle!

, If using a cleaning rod, be careful not to jam the rod into the bottom of the slide. If you are rough, you risk denting the crook at the end of the slide.

,,, However, this stage of the cleaning should really be handled by a trained instrument technician, as any sort of scratch or dent in the valve will adversely affect the playability of the horn.

, Special attention should be given to the rotary valve, water key (or spit valve), and the outer and inner slides.

,,, Most of the oil should be applied by dripping it in through the pipe where the bell section and playing slide meet, though a few drops may be applied to the rotary valve directly.

Learn to buzz your lips on the pitch center.,
Use proper air support.,
Make sure you have lots of range.,
For a rich, full tone, you should say ""o"" as you play.",How to Have Better Tone on a Trombone," This is essential. The pitch you buzz with your lips must match the pitch selected by the slide position. Buzzing either too high or too low will result in a weak tone. This is true of all brass instruments, but it is particularly true for the trombone.


Practice buzzing with just the mouthpiece to train your lips (and your ears) to buzz on pitch.;
, Low range requires large volumes of air delivered at relatively low pressure. High range requires a small volume of air delivered at high pressure. Be sure to use the diaphragm to support the air flow. This is particularly important in the high range.

, This means you can play very low notes and very high notes, as well as everything in between.You can expand your range by simply playing as high as you can, and holding the note for a few seconds, and then repeating that a few times every time you play.


Your embouchure is vital to good tone. Embouchure is your mouth and what its doing. Make sure your cheeks aren't puffed out at all.

, You can play around with different sounds and what the do to your tone, but unless you're playing jazz, ""o"" is the one to go with.


And also, when you have perfected your piece/s and you play them in front of a crowd don't stop playing if you mess up ( you didn't go there to practice the people want to hear you play! ). If you used the tips here and the basics of playing the trombone, you should be fine.

Use your fills wisely.",How to Play Drums," You don't have to have a monstrous kit with a gong like Neil Peart from Rush to get started drumming. You don't even have to have a kit at all. To get started on the basics, use your hands and tops of your thighs in a seated position to learn basic drum-kit rhythms. Listen to music with obvious rhythms and try to mock the rhythm with your hands.


Many beginners can get frustrated upon plopping down behind a kit and not being able to play a simple rhythm yet. It's a good idea to start getting some sense of rhythm before dropping the cash on a big drum kit to practice on, or before giving yourself an opportunity to get frustrated.;
, There are many ways to break down a a musical bar, but for the purposes of getting started, we'll discuss 4/4 time signature, meaning that there are 4 beats in a measure. Tap out 4 equal beats with one hand. These are quarter notes.


Count out loud when you're just getting started. It's important to keep track of the rhythm and learn what you're playing, allowing you to develop more complex awareness of beat.
It's a good idea to use a metronome or a click track to practice rhythms. They're easy to find online, in GarageBand, or on your phone, or by playing along to songs.

, Each quarter note is made up of two eighth notes. Keep tapping that simple quarter note beat with one hand and then try eighth notes at the same beat. These are counted ""1-and-2-and-3-and-4-and..."" Try your best to say it steadily and beat it with your hand.

, Continue with your first hand, counting out eighth notes. Now, whenever you say ""Two"" and ""Four,"" tap the table or the top of your thigh with your other hand. This fills in where you'll be hitting the snare when you sit behind a kit.

, Continue tapping with both hands, but now whenever you say ""One"" or ""Three"", tap your right (or left) foot. This is called the downbeat, and is what you'll tap out on the bass drum.


You're playing a simple rock-style drum beat! Learning drums is broken into two big categories of things you need to learn: rhythm and technique. You can't learn technique without a drum kit, but you can learn about rhythm. By learning everything you can about rhythms and developing your sense of keeping a beat and counting before you ever sit behind a drum kit, you'll be a better drummer and be able to learn more quickly.

, Each kit is different, using different kinds of drums that make up a set. There are different brands, sizes, sticks used, and different tunings among other slighter modifications that will affect the overall sound of each instrument. Still, many drum kits employ basically the same fundamental pieces. Most basic kits include:


A bass drum, which makes the low-pitched booming sound when struck by a weighted mallet operated by a foot pedal.
A snare drum, usually located to the non-dominant side of the drummer and played with the drummer's non-dominant stick. The snare is a tight, bright drum with a band of rattling metal beads under the drum head. Typically, the snare is known for its crisp ""click"" sound followed by the ""resonating shuffle"" of the beads.
There are many types of tom-tom drums, but the most common three are the Floor Tom (the deepest of the three), the Mid-Tom (the medium of the three), and the High-Tom (the most high-pitched of the three). A very basic kit may only have the floor tom, while others may have many. They're tuned differently to create an array of different deeper noises for fills.

, There are many different kinds of cymbals, varying in type, shape, and sound. A cymbal is a round, metal object that resonates when struck. The four most commonly used types of cymbals are the hi-hat, the ride, the splash, and the crash.


The hi-hat is a pair of cymbals mounted on a foot pedal. The foot pedal is usually played by the left foot and controls the cymbals, bringing them together when pressed and bringing them apart when released. You can strike the cymbal when it is apart or closed, and you can shut the cymbals with your feet at different rates of speed, each creating a different sound.
The ride cymbal creates a more subtle and deeper sound than the other cymbals because it is used to play very repetitively throughout most music. The cymbal will usually resonate from one strike to another, featuring a very long reverberating ""finish"" to the sound.
The splash is a cymbal that creates a metallic ""splashing"" sound, similar to the sound a water splash makes. It dies quickly after peaking and is typically used in basic fills to ornament your beat.
The crash is similar to the splash, but usually generates a loud and long, sustained sound. Listen for the crash at the end of measures in pop music or especially in periods of heightened drama in orchestral music.

, There are two main ways to hold drum sticks, called the matched grip and the traditional grip.


In the matched grip, you hold the sticks between your thumb and index finger a few inches from the bottom of the sticks. Wrap your remaining fingers around the sticks. Be sure the back side of your hands are facing up rather than facing to the side. This method is the most common way of holding sticks, allowing you plenty of wrist control and comfort.
In the traditional grip, you'll hold the stick in your non-dominant hand by resting the stick in the cradle between your thumb and index finger and on top of your ring finger. Wrap your thumb, index and middle fingers around the stick. Hold the other stick using a matched grip. Some jazz drummers use a traditional grip to offer a different kind of control on the snare drum, playing intricate rhythms on it as part of fills.

, If you are interested in drumming, price many different new and used options before you spend the money on a set. Talk to the people at the stores and they should steer you in the right direction. Start out with a cheap, new set or a used set until you finally decide if you are going to stick with it.


You can also consider joining your school band to have access to the equipment and lessons to help you learn. You might even ask in your band department if you'd be allowed to practice a few times on a kit because you're interested in the drums. The music folk are generally friendly people, and it can't hurt to ask.

, There are a lot out there, but there is no right or wrong stick. 5A is a good stick weight for beginners.


Have your drum teacher or the people at the store give you some pointers on how to hold the sticks, how to hit the drum properly, how to adjust the drums to fit your stature, and how to set up your kit at home. You can also find a lot of this information for free on the internet.

, Good posture will make you more comfortable during practice and help you reach the drums more easily. You'll sound better and enjoy playing more by improving your posture.


Sit up straight and keep your elbows in. Stay in tight to the kit, keeping the floor pedals at a comfortable distance from you.

, This can't be stressed enough: you need to learn to play a steady, even tempo and the easiest way to beat that into your brain is by practicing with a metronome. If you can't afford a metronome, you can find a click track somewhere which is a recorded metronome that you can play in your stereo, on your Walkman, or on your computer while you practice.

, Play the 8th notes on the hi-hat, hitting the snare drum on 2 and 4, and pressing the bass drum pedal with your foot on the 1 and 3.


Make sure you count out loud when you are playing. Eventually you won't have to, but do it while you are learning and when you are practicing.
To mix it up and get familiar with the kit, hit something else on the ""Two"" and on the ""Four"" instead of the snare drum, hit everywhere else.
Try to develop a groove and get used to playing evenly, while counting out loud and while playing with the click.

, Learn how to close the hi-hat with the left foot when you strike it with your hands. It makes a different, shorter sound. This is the position at which most drummers use the hi-hat most frequently.


Play straight eighth notes with the right hand. Use the left hand and hit the snare on ""Two"" and ""Four"". Lift your foot off of the hi-hat here and there to get used to the sounds you are making. You can open it all the way, open it a little and hit the hi-hat in different places such as the outside rim, or the bell at the top to get different sounds.

, At the same time you hit the hi-hat, learn to work in bass drum rhythms to help develop the muscles.


Try to play with the right hand and foot at the same time, left hand free styling, or with all limbs at the same time to really get your muscles used to moving.

, Play the same thing above, but instead of hitting the snare on the ""Two"" and ""Four"" hit the hi-hat. When you are lifting your right hand off the hi-hat move your left hand down to hit the snare. Now you are basically playing the snare drum in between each hit of the hi-hat.


While you are doing this count out loud ""One e and a Two e and a Three e and a Four e and a"" continuing to hit the hi-hat with the right hand on the ""One and Two and Three and Four and"" but hitting the snare on the ""es and as.""

, If you notice any tension, or you're struggling to keep up with the beats at the RPM you've set the metronome at, slow down the metronome until you feel relaxed.

, The basic ""single"" stroke and a ""double"" stroke are absolutely essential to developing your limb independence and drum complexity. If you strike the drum with one beat from each alternating hand, you have a single stroke pattern. However, if you strike the drum with one downward movement from each alternating hand and let the stick bounce on each alternating stroke to get two hits per stroke, you have a double stroke pattern.


This is what enables a drummer to perform very fast rolls and patterns. By studying and practicing the 26 American drum rudiments, you will be well on your way to mastering single, double, triple and quadruple stroke patterns.

, It can be a bit like rubbing your belly and patting your head, but learning drums means that you've eventually got to do more complicated things all at once. Instead of making one movement up and one movement down you may have to double or triple or even quadruple one movement with a limb while the other limbs do something else in another direction.


Count the same beat you've been using so far with eighth notes, and on every beat close the hi-hat with your left foot and open it on the offbeats, or ""ands"". Hit the snare drum on the twos and fours to make a basic rock beat. With your right hand keep 8th note time (one and two and three and four and) on the rim of the snare or on a ride cymbal if you have one.

, Experiment with various beats with the right foot while keeping the rest of the limbs locked in the main pattern. This is where it starts to get tricky. Don't worry though, it gets easier the more you play. You have to get your limbs used to making movements that are independent of each other. There is no quick way to do this. Just take your time and think about what you are doing. If you break it down into one beat at a time it makes things a lot easier.

, For quarter note triplets you must think in terms of half notes. Count 1-la-le evenly in the space of the half note. For eighth note triplets it's the same, but with three notes split in the space of a quarter note.


Triplets are not used that much in rock beats but you will find them in drum fills and used in percussion lines found in school bands. Basically a triplet is where you play 3 notes in the time you usually play 2. you can have quarter note triplets, 8th note triplets, 16th note triplets, 32nd note triplets.
We have a cool sounding beat with 8th note triplets. They are counted """" or any three syllable word. Play this along with the metronome each click on the metronome is a beat and each beat is subdivided.

, 16th notes are basically what you played earlier when you were learning to move your hands in opposite directions. These are counted """"


16th note triplets are counted , 32nd notes should be counted ""[4 e + a + e + a}


There are 32nd note triplets that require a lot of subdivision to count and are pretty much too fast to say out loud, but if you want to hear some 32nd notes and 32nd not triplets, then listen to the song ""Hey Joe"" by Jimi Hendrix. These notes are hard to play correctly because you need to be able to play them evenly, making the same sound on the drums with each hand and be able to move around the drum kit playing these notes in time with the rest of the song.

, Each click will be quarter beat and easy to keep time by the time you get to the higher subdivisions you will be counting faster or playing faster but the numbers you say will always land on the clicks of the metronome.

, Listen to some of your favorite songs and use a small subdivision such as the 8th or 16th note count and you will see that during a lot of the fills you will hear spaces where there is silence when you are counting. These are the rests.

, When you play an accented note with the right hand it should sound the same when you play with the left and when you make a normal stroke with the right it will sound the same as the left and vice versa and so on.


An accented stroke is when you strike the drum harder than the other strokes (usually on the rim of the drum, also known as a rimshot). Accents give a very dynamic effect to the music. In music notation, accents are shown by the mathematical ""greater than"" sign (>).

, The purpose of a drum fill is to add a little flair to a song. A guitar player plays a hot little lick and a singer might shout and dance about, and the drummer plays fills. These happen in time between the beats, usually on the toms and the cymbals. Listen to John Bonham to hear the master of drum fills.

, Play ""1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +"" and play as you did before with right hand on the hi-hat and left on the snare. Use the right foot on the kick. Repeat as you warm up. Now continue counting out loud and just play ""1 + 2 +"" and then stop playing with your limbs and just finish counting out loud ""3 + 4 +""repeat.


It should sound like ""Boom tic Pap tic"" now on the ""3 + 4 +"" do anything else for example start with moving every limb at the same time on the ""3 + 4 +"" you can hit the crash (if you have one) on the one on the following bar and you will have pulled off your first fill.

, Do every combination and variation on this basic theme, while counting the ""3 + 4 +"". Some will sound good to you some won't. Some basic ones can be all snare alternating hands. Two kick and then two snares. Two snares and two kicks. As long as you keep the time it doesn't matter what you pick as long as the time stays even.

, Continue to play the ""1 + 2 +"" as you did above. Now pick a couple subdivisions of the beat as written out between the brackets above for the ""3"" beat and the ""4"" beat"" such as ""[4 e + a} play note while counting out loud and use all limbs at the same time as you did above.


Now pick other subdivisions for the ""3"" and 4"" beat you can go """" or """" or """" or whatever. Is it starting to get easier yet? As long as the notes are played evenly and within the time you have lots and lots of possible combinations for the fills.
You don't have to just play the beat and beat as fills. You can play the whole bar as a fill picking any of the subdivisions for each beat and combining them such as """" or whatever you picked. Say the subdivisions out loud then play with all limbs and then play around with using different sounds and sound combinations for the subdivisions.

, Learn to hold back on fills, even if you're a killer drummer. AC/DC songs feature extremely simple fills or no fills at all, which fits in perfectly with their no-frills reputation as a band. It would sound ridiculous if ""Back in Black"" featured a drum solo.


You don't have to start a fill at the beginning of a beat. Count "" One and Two"" and play it like you did before with the right hand on the hi-hat and the left on the snare but when you get to the ""and three and four and"" play the fill starting on that and instead of waiting for the ""three"" beat.

Lay your drumsticks on the ground.,
Pick up your bachi.,
Hit a surface.,
Get to a drum or drum surface.,
Stand with your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.,
Place your arms in ready position.,
Strike - The tip of your bachi should roughly describe a circle, or an inverted teardrop, the narrow end being at the drumskin and the round end being the apex of your strike.,
Basic rhythms - There are three basic rhythms that I'll mention here: san doko, doko doko and don ko.",How to Play Taiko Drums," How you hold your stick (bachi) is very important: Your grip needs to be loose enough that the bachi can move, but firm enough that you don't drop it.;
, Pick them up again with your fingers together and your first finger and thumb forming a V. Grasp the bachi at about a quarter of the way up. Wrap your fingers around the bachi and push your first finger a little higher up the stick - this helps with your control. Always make sure the V is on top.


Some taiko players liken a bachi stroke motion to whipping a towel. When you whip a towel up and down properly, the end of the towel makes a nice '?' shape and comes down right over your shoulder. Your bachi should have a similar trajectory, looseness, and quickness when coming down to hit the drum.
It is important to relax your muscles and not ""force"" your hit. Try gripping your bachi tightly and air-drumming while tense--you will see it is very tiring! In order to play for a long time, you need to relax. Make sure your grip on your bachi is just tight enough that they will not fall out of your hand.

, Try a pillow, couch, actual drumhead, tire, trampoline top, or anything else that won't break when hit. You want a surface that is relatively tight, so that you can experience the bachi bouncing back after you hit. Hit any way you want, to make any sound you want. Pay attention to what you like, and what feels comfortable.


When you strike you should be able to hear the bachi hitting against your palm; don't make a fist.
You can hit many in succession or only a few. Practice loud and soft hits; big and small hits. Play around with it so that you have a better sense of what body motions translate into which sounds.

, If you do not have a taiko, you can use a PVC pipe, chair with an old tire on it, or any other surface that fits your height and size.

, Your knees should be bent to allow you to move about as you play. Keep your back straight and your shoulders relaxed and down: remember that they shouldn't rise when you strike.

, While you are holding your bachi, place the bachi tips onto the drum head as if you are ready to play. Your arms should follow a gentle curve with your bachi ending up resting above the centre of the drum. One analogy is holding a basket of rice. Finally, stand with a comfortable distance between you and the drum, not too much of a stretch and not too cramped. You should be just able to reach the middle.

, Your elbow should not go backwards and forwards at all, only up and down, with the circular movement coming only from your forearm.
As with many things, it's all in the wrist. Keep it loose as your bachi comes down, then tighten it quickly as you hit the drum. To use another analogy, it's like gently flicking paint off a paintbrush. Most of the energy used in striking the drum is in the form of lifting the bachi and the final flick at the end. Don't force the bachi down - let gravity do the work. You can then use the bounce off the drum to get the bachi back up for the next strike. By keeping this in mind, you use less energy and can drum for longer without getting too tired.
The final point to remember is don't leave the tip of your bachi on the drumskin after you hit. This deadens the sound, and then what's the point of playing great big drums?

,
These words are kuchi-showa, a phonetic system used to describe the sound made by the drum.San doko - This is the rhythm most commonly played on shime, a small drum used to count time. San is a crotchet beat, or quarter beat, and doko is two quavers, or eighth beats. In other words, there are two doko beats for one san beat. It is played as right right-left.Doko doko - Two quaver or eighth notes, played in progression.Don ko - A ""swung"" beat. The don is given heavier weighting than the ko. This is used for songs with a jazzier feel.
A good guide to understanding kuchi-showa is available here.

Exercise daily - you don't want to pull a muscle do you?,
Learn how to perform both the heel up and heel down techniques.,
Once you've figured out which way you like to play double bass ""Heel-up or Heel-down"" play 16th notes alternating right-left-right-left and gradually get faster (wait until you can play perfect 16th notes before increasing your speed!).,
Go on the Internet and find out the 25 Rudiments of drumming.,
Once you have the 16th notes down work on 32nd notes then 64ths then rolls.

,
Afterwards get a piece of music that you play in concert band and play the snare part on your feet.

,
Once you have completed this and you sound like a god at rolling on the bass then you must decide what type of music you would like to learn using the 25 rudiments of drumming and implementing them into your feet.

,
An essential thing that is often overlooked is tempo and consistent timing.,
Do not be surprised if you see no results after a month; there will probably be none.",How to Play Double Bass Drums," Make sure that you stretch before playing (One recommends doing 3 sets of 25 calf raises 30 seconds prior to playing).;
,

The heel down technique is simple, yet most drummers find it more difficult than heel up. Put both of your feet on the foot pedals so that they completely cover them. Then, just play a rhythm by following one beat after the other. Do not raise your foot off the pedal, you want your foot to stay in contact with the foot board so you will have better control of the entire motion of each hit. You may feel muscle strain in the front of your calf, that means that you are using the correct muscles, but don't overdo it!






The heel up technique - place your feet onto the pedal the same way as in Heel down technique, but lift your heel off the pedal. The ball of your foot should always stay in contact with the foot board so that you maintain control of the entire movement of each hit. Kick one beat after the other. Make sure that you rest the beater of the pedal on the bass drum between hits so that your muscles have a chance to relax. Instead of feeling muscle strain in your calf, you may feel it in the front of your thigh (quadriceps). Again, don't overdo it!







, Try the reverse: left-right-left-right. Try different patterns and repeat each many times. There is a book called ""Stick Control"" that has many different pattern suggestions.

, Such as: Single stroke rolls, Double stroke rolls, Paradiddles, Flams, Flamacue, Flamadiddle, and many more.

,,,, Use a metronome and start slow (60 or 70 bpm). Then slowly build up. Make sure your timing is 100% accurate.

, It takes much longer than that. Measure your progress every two months or so.

This should be done once Every 2 to 6 Months:;
,
Fill a bathtub with lukewarm water.,
Disassemble the trombone into its two main parts, the slide and the bell section.,
Place all the parts in the bathtub of lukewarm water and let them soak.,
Once the parts have soaked for five to ten minutes, stand the bell section up away from the other parts and gently rub the bell with the cotton rags on the outside and as much as you can on the inside.,
Take the outer slide and run the snake back and fourth through inside of it.,
Pick up the inner slide and using a clean cotton rag, wipe it firmly but gently up and down the outside.,
Use the snake to clean the inside of the tuning slide.,
Take the mouthpiece brush and push it back and forth into the shank (the part that fits into the trombone) of the mouthpiece.,
Finishing off.",How to Clean a Trombone,", Do not use hot water. It helps to place a dampened towel or cloth at the bottom of the bathtub to avoid dents or scratches. I repeat, WARNING: Do NOT use hot water under any circumstances!


Hot water can actually damage the lacquer. Lukewarm water will be just fine.

, Next, take the outer slide off the inner slide. You should now have three parts. Then remove the tuning slide (or both if you have a Bb/F trigger trombone).


Now you should have four (or five) parts in the water. Include the mouthpiece and you will have five (or six.)

, *Gently handle the parts at all times.

,


Rinse the bell with cold water.
Use the beach towel and dry the bell as much as possible. Set it aside in a safe place where it will not be knocked over and let it finish by air drying.

, Make sure the outer slide is filled with water. Do this for about 1 to 2 minutes on each side of the slide.


Often junk will come out into the water. That's good! Keep working at it for at least a minute on each side. Using a clean stream of cold water, rinse the inside and outside of the outer slide. Dry with a beach towel and let it air dry with the bell.

, Next, take the snake and clean the inside of the inner slide as before with the outer slide. Rinse and dry and place it with the other parts.

,


Often the tuning slide grease will eventually gum on the part of the tuning slide that fits into the bell section. To clean this, use a penetrating oil like WD-40. Spray the tuning slide with the penetrating oil and let it sit for a few minutes, before wiping away as much ""gunk"" as possible. If the horn has not been cleaned in a while, you may have to repeat this process several times.

, This will only take about 30 seconds or so. Rub the mouthpiece with a cotton rag, then dry it. If the mouthpiece gets gunk in the cup or shank, it will greatly disrupt the airflow when playing, so do not neglect your mouthpiece.

,


After the horn has completely ""air dried"" you will have a nice clean trombone. You will have to reapply a slide lubricant to the slide, then apply tuning slide grease to the tuning slides. Use both sparingly -- a little goes a long way.
Reinsert the tuning slide(s) into the bell section. Wipe any extra grease away with a clean cloth or cotton rag. Now your set to clean your trombone and remember clean well and clean often...  :)

Be familiar with the music you'll be playing.,
Decide which groove is most appropriate for each song.,
Consider your worship team's musical and physical environment.,
Keep impeccable timing.,
Focus on maintaining worship for the congregation.,
Consider using Drumtee mutes on the drums.,
Practice, practice, practice!

",How to Play Drums for a Church Band," This may involve popular contemporary worship artists such as Chris Tomlin and Hillsong. To gain experience in worship music, listen and practice to it on your own time.;
, You may feel that your band is strong enough to duplicate the song's original studio track and proceed to copy the official drum groove, or you may want to adjust or change it for the sake of your audience's worship experience.

, If you're playing with more professional musicians in a large church, for example, feel free to play louder and imitate the original song in your drumming - not only will the song feel more familiar to the other musicians and the congregation, but you'll look like a better drummer. If you're in a closer environment or a small youth group, for example, don't beat the drums too hard - perhaps only play what is necessary to keep the backbone for the guitarists, vocalists and other musicians who follow your lead.

, The drums are the ""backbone"" the musical body and hold everything together. While the pianist or vocalists may like to take the lead in worship music, make sure they're keeping up with you so that the whole band stays together.


Regardless of the original drum part, good church drummers typically restrain their playing to basic rock grooves with smooth fills and crash cymbals to distinct verses from choruses and so on, unless changing this style enhances the overall worship experience for the audience.

, Play what you're confident with, and don't put on too much of a show, as this draws away from the lyrics and worship atmosphere you're trying to provide the church.

, A Drumtee mute will quiet the drums without sacrificing the underlying tone of the drum. They are ideal for church settings.

Learn Basic Rudiments: Flams, Flam Accents, Flamacues, Paradiddles, Flamadiddles, Ruffs, Lesson 25's, and Dragadiddles.,
Flam: Flams are played with one stick high above the drum (about 8-12 inches) and one stick low (about 3 inches).,
Learn Flam Accents: Flam Accents are simply a flam followed by two taps.,
Learn Flamacues: Flamacues can be counted ""flam-bam-a-cue-flam"" or ""flam-left-right-left-flam"", but it's important to get a good, solid accent out of your left hand on that ""bam"" note.,
Learn Paradiddles: Paradiddles are played ""Right-Left-Right-Right Left-Right-Left-Left"".,
Learn Flamadiddles: flamadiddles are paradiddles that start with a flam.,
Learn Ruffs: ruffs are similar to flams, except the ""low"" stick makes two strokes or bounces.,
Learn Lesson 25's: Lesson 25's are similar to a flam accent, but for ruffs.,
Learn Dragadiddles: there are two kinds of dragadiddles, no.1 and no.2, but are both a type of paradiddle with ruffs.,
Learn Advanced Rudiments: flam taps, drags, sextuplets, and ratamacues.,
Learn Flam Taps: flam taps are played ""flam-right flam-left"".,
Learn Drags: drags are a form of ruff rudiment and can be single or double.,






,
Learn Sextuplets: Sextuplets are simply counted ""1-2-3-4-5-6-7"".,
Ratamacues: Ratamacues are similar to sextuplets but are only ""1-2-3-4"".,
Learn Double Stroke Rolls: these are also considered rudiments and there are several different kinds of them: 5's, 6s, 7's, 9's, 10's, 11's, 13's, 15's, and 17's.,
There are also several Swiss Rudiments, which aren't considered essential but can help improve your style and skills.",How to Play Drum Rudiments,",, The sticks should strike the drum head at the same time and actually produce a sound that resembles ""f-lam"".

The high stick should use an arm motion, which gives it speed and power. The low stick is a wrist motion, which helps to keep it low.
Beginners tend to loose focus of their ""low"" hand and allow it to steadily get higher. This affects the sound of the flam as well as technique, since flams should be alternated.
If you're having problems getting good sound or transitioning, you could try this exercise: focus on one hand at a time, doing a high hit and then a low hit back and forth to teach your hands how to make smoother transitions. Do the same on the other hand.
Music Notation:



 

flams are a quarter note with a grace note- you can think of the big note as the high stick and the small grace note as the low stick.

, These are also alternated: right handed flam left right; left handed flam right left.

It is important to play these steadily. First play ""1-2-3, 1-2-3"" (right left right, left right left). Only once this is a steady beat, without awkward pauses, add in the flams. Usually beginners play ""flam... left right... flam... right left"" because they need to think about this sticking. Thinking is fine, but work hard to get rid of those pauses.







,

The counting ""flam-bam-a-cue-flam"" does kind of get misleading when you try to speed it up. Your beats should come out evenly, ""1-2-3-4-5"".
Music Notation: flamacues are typically sixteenth notes, they start and end with a flam. The arrow over the second note indicates an accent.







, You can think of the ""para"" as meaning either ""right-left"" or ""left-right"" and ""diddle"" means ""right-right"" or ""left-left"".

Make sure your paradiddles stay even ""1-2-3-4 1-2-3-4"". There's a lot of temptation to rush the diddle because you can bounce your stick then.
Paradiddles can be made into double and triple paradiddles (played: ""para-para-diddle"" or ""para-para-para-diddle""). They can also be made into paradiddle-diddles.
Music Notation: are often written as sixteenth notes and usually the sticking is marked to show that they are a paradiddle.







, The ""flama"" indicates ""flam-left"" or ""flam-right"". Being able to alternate your flams well are important for good flamadiddles.





, The bounce will start just before the high stick reaches the drum head. There shouldn't be a pause between the two strokes.

Music Notation: looks similar to a flam, but has two grace notes.







, They are played ""ruff-Left-Right"", with the ""right"" being accented.

While most rudiments are alternated, many drummers chose to play Lesson 25's only on their right hand (a right handed ruff).
Music Notation: Is usually an eighth note-sixteenth note combination. The ruff is the first note and the last note is accented (shown by the arrow).







, No.1 is played ""right-ruff-left-right-right, left-ruff-right-left-left"" and no.2 is played ""right-ruff-ruff-left-right-right, left-ruff-ruff-right-left-left"".

For no.2, the ""right-ruff"" or ""left-ruff"" at the beginning is played at half the speed of the paradiddle portion.
If the dragadiddle is started with a right tap, the ruff is a right handed ruff (high stick = right).







,, If you're playing a right-handed flam, there should be a right-handed tap.

Practice these slowly for a long time, making sure to build up coordination and muscle memory before trying to speed them up. Bounce the high stick in the flam into the following tap to get even fast.







, A single drag is played ""right-ruff left-ruff"" and a double drag is played ""right-ruff-ruff left-ruff-ruff"", with each tap being accented.

The rhythm is a little tricky because there is the smallest of pauses between the tap and the following ruff(s), but no pause between the ruff(s) and next tap. ""right (pause) ruff ruff left (pause) ruff ruff"".







,, They are played quickly, with the ""1"" and the ""7"" being the downbeats (when your foot hits the ground while keeping beat).

Some people find it helpful to think of them as 2 quick triplets ""1-2-3 1-2-3 1"", this can give a slight accent on all of the ""1""s played.







, ""4"" should be accented.

The sticking is a bit weird: ""right-left-right-left left-right-left-right"". Because of this, there should be a pause between two ratamacues, which allows the stick to raise back up and prepare to start again.






Ratamacues can be complicated by adding in ruffs. A single ratamacue has a ruff at the beginning (ruff-left-right-left ruff-right-left-right). A double ratamacue adds 2 ruffs and a triple ratamacue adds 3.

If at all possible, get a qualified teacher.,
If you cannot find a suitable teacher, watch videos on learning to play the bass drum.",How to Play Bass Drum1," It is much easier to learn from a teacher, who will be able to correct your errors, ensure that you have good posture and that you are playing accurately. Your teacher will have many helpful tips to improve your learning.;
, Although not as good as a teacher, these will at least show you exactly how to hold the drum and play it correctly. Check out sites such as YouTube.

"
"
Get the correct posture:


Relax.,
Play the bass drum.,
Hit the drum correctly.,
Get the rhythm right.,
Don't practice ""above your head"".,
Memorize your music.,
Practice with the bassline to get your parts solid before going into a rehearsal with the rest of the drumline.,
On the practice field: Get your charts.,
Playing long splits: Playing split sextuplets can look really hard but just know where you come in and it should be fine.",How to Play Bass Drum2," Don't use any more muscles than necessary.
Maintain a strong fulcrum.
Hands, when not playing, should be at rest in the set position in order to look confident and professional.
Chops are the key to playing great – burning muscle pain is your friend.

, When playing a marching bass drum, play in the center of the head. Have the mallet striking at a right angle (check this by practicing in a mirror). The mallet must always contact the head with its full velocity, especially when playing low.


Play through the drum; when playing an orchestral bass drum, strike a bit off center––this will produce fuller overtones.
Be able to play the whole part with proper mallet heights before attempting to split it up with the bassline.

, Make sure it is always hitting the drum in the center of the head, this may be harder if you have a smaller drum. his will get a fuller sound. If you have rolls, make sure your pinkies don't fly out!

, Practice with a metronome or electronically quantized music.


Know where the downbeats are and be able to count all of the rhythms while marking time with your feet.
When playing splits, always stay with the full ensemble, don't adjust your timing to a previous error within the bassline.
Play aggressively.

, Take one step at a time (especially with tempos).

, However, get to know the whole part and not just yours. Knowing how the split flows will help you with your own part.

, Once you rehearse with the drumline, you will see how your parts fit in with the snares and tenors. This will help with cues and timing.

, When you set them up, make sure you know where your music starts and stops and how it fits in with the charts. Make sure your spacing in the bassline is even, as this will be very noticeable. Make sure the drumline's  arcs and lines are smooth (because you are probably on the end and you can tell if it is smooth, more than the snares).

, Also, don't crush them down. They should sound smooth and not choppy. The same rules apply to 32nd note splits, if they are at fast tempos they probably won’t sound choppy. Just make sure you are hitting all four notes and not just three. If you are used to playing sextuplet runs and then you have a 16th note run, make the switch in your head and play them smooth and even.

Play a 4/4 on the hi-hat.,
Throw in the bass.,
Add the snare.,
Play eight notes.",How to Play Basic Beats on a Drum Kit," All that means is to count 1-2-3-4 at an even pace and hit the high hat on every beat. This is the most basic part of the drum beat.;
, Every time you play 1 and 3, hit the hi-hat and bass drum at the same time. Be sure to hit the hi-hat too, not just the bass. Many drummers forget that.

, You have probably noticed that in between bass hits there's a gap. Fill the gap by hitting the hi-hat and snare at the same time on beats 2 and 4. Your beat should sound like this (keep in mind the hi-hat is played on every beat too), Bass-Snare-Bass-Snare.

, This is slightly harder than the first beat. Instead of counting 1-2-3-4 on the hi-hat, play 1&2&3&4&. This is called eight notes. Still hit the bass drum on beats 1 and 3 and still hit the snare drum on beats 2 and 4, there should be one hi-hat hit in between bass and snare hits.

"
"
Find an easy song.,
Grip your sticks between your thumb and forefinger, using your other fingers as support.,
Put your headphones on and press play on your CD or MP3 player.,
Clap along normally to the rhythm while keeping your bass-drum rhythm going.,
Add the hi-hat by playing every time the guitar is strummed.,
Play with all four limbs together through the entire song.,
Practice the rhythm as many times as you can, and always be aware of the four-beat cycle common to many pop and rock songs.",How to Play a Song on Drums," ""Yellow"" by Coldplay is a good, slow song to use as a starting point, but many other popular rock and pop songs follow the same basic pattern. Listen for the beat and count it in fours: 1, 2, 3, 4; 1, 2, 3, 4.;
, Use your left stick to play the snare drum. Cross your right arm over the top to access the hi-hat cymbal. Put your right foot on the bass-drum pedal and, for this song, keep your left foot off the hi-hat pedal.

, Wait until the vocal has started, and then start playing the bass drum. Play on the words ""Look,"" ""Stars,"" ""Look,"" ""Shine"" and ""You"" in the first line. You are now playing on beats one and three of the four-beat cycle. Keep this rhythm going.

, You should be clapping on beats two and four of the cycle. Then instead of clapping, play the snare drum with your left stick on beats two and four. Play on the words ""At,"" ""(no lyric),"" ""How"" and ""For.""

, Instead of playing on 1, 2, 3, 4, you play the hi-hat twice as often. So the hi-hat beat will be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Leave your foot off the hi-hat pedal.

, The beat changes somewhat throughout the song so after some practice, you'll be able to improvise and deviate from the set pattern above to copy exactly what the drummer does.

, Find another song you like with the same rhythm and apply what you've learned. Concentrate on the basic beat. Once you've mastered that, you'll be able to elaborate.

Treat a solo like a story, complete with characters, tension, and plot.,
Start slowly and rhythmically, often repeating the basic groove of the song.,
Keep time with either the hi-hats, bass drum(s), both, or none.,
Figure out 2-3 ""safe spots"" that you can always come back to if you get lost.,
Remember that more notes don't always equal a better solo.,
Consider common ""compositional ideas"" to start practicing with structure.,
End the solo by coming back in time, either softly or with a climactic bang.",How to Play a Good Drum Solo1," A good solo doesn't have to be blazing fast, technically showy, or immaculately planned -- it has to entertain the audience. Jazz instrumentalists have known for decades that a good solo, improvised or otherwise, is like a short story. It must grab the audience with a simple, recognizable groove, grow in suspense or intrigue, then explode with a triumphant climax. While this may seem silly, taking a holistic, story-telling mentality will do wonders for your work:


Think of each drum as a character. Which one is the protagonist, holding everything together? Most often than this is a snare, kick drum, or high-hat keeping time.
Like a good thriller or dramatic scene, how can you use silence to increase the tension? What about a burst of volume and power roaring in like a sudden plot twist?
Movies and stories get repetitive if they show the same scenes or conflicts over and over again -- how can you get off of your favorite drums and introduce a new ""character?"";
, Starting with your most impressive or fast stuff leaves you nowhere to go but down, so save the technical flash for the end. For starters, you want to help the audience get into the groove of the solo. Don't forget that, up until this point, you provided the entire rhythmic backbone of the song. Beginning with 1-2 bars of the basic groove establishes the rhythm for the audience and the fact that you're about to go it alone. It also is a simple starting ground, allowing everything after it to get more and more impressive.


Have the rest of the band drop out or stick to very basic rhythm duties. Drums solos get complex and don't mesh well if the rest of the band is trying to be impressive as well., Not all drum solos need to keep time throughout, and many will flicker in and out of keeping time. But for beginners keeping one hand or foot as a metronome is a great way to stay grounded while you explore the kit. It may be a good idea to use different foot patterns, tempos, and time signatures throughout your solo, but this can only happen once you've established the song's ""normal"" rhythm., Even advanced drummers can get caught up in a solo, taking them into strange patterns, tricks, and new ideas. But you still need to keep the basic groove of the song alive. A good way to do this is to memorize a few basic grooves that you can use to ""ground the solo."" You play 1 bar of the groove, then 2 bars of out-there improv. You can then come back to the groove for a bar, re-establishing the rhythm, before diving back off the deep end.


When practicing, master a few ""mini-solos"" or sections that you enjoy playing. If you're ever not sure what to play next in a solo you can fall back on these building blocks.

, Good solos are not all about speed, and too much speed may actively ruin a solo. Think of a roller coaster -- if they all started with the high-speed drop and never did anything else, then every ride would be the same and they'd get boring quickly. You want to build the suspense by varying speed, timing, and fun tricks so that each one feels more exciting than the last, which will guarantee the best response once you finally do show off your top speed.


Remember -- the goal is to entertain, not to show off your skills.

, A good place to start soloing is by mimicking other solos, finding common patterns and ideas shared by many drummers. You can, and should, try to imitate the solos you admire. Keep an ear out for the following forms, which can give your solos instant shape and structure:



Call and Response: Made famous by the blues, this is when you imagine two ""voices"" in the drums -- one that ""asks"" a question, the other that answers it. One voice might be your toms and the other a snare, or you can let the other instruments be the call while the drums respond.

Theme and Variation: You play one common lick or riff over and over again. However, with each bar you subtly change things, so that by the middle of the solo you're playing a completely different lick than when you started. You can then bring it full circle back to the original theme., If the song is going to continue after your solo, many drummers will use the last 3-4 bars to quiet down, signaling closure and helping the band hop back in time. Other songs need to end with your best stuff-- a triumphant finale that brings everything to a close.


Talk to your bandmates ahead of time and organize a ""cue"" for them to come back in. It could be a simple silence or a recognizable cymbal pattern -- anything to cue them that they need to play again."
"
Stay relaxed and loose, even during intense solos.,
Use dynamics, or changing volumes, to create tension.,
Drop into different time signatures, or no time signature at all.,
Practice to a metronome, especially if you want to play with ""off-time"" solos.,
Continue practicing your rudiments, rolls, and rhythmic consistency to build technical skill.,
Listen to soloists in any genre to pick up tips, tricks, and potential patterns.",How to Play a Good Drum Solo2," One of the keys to smooth, fluid solos is remembering to remain relaxed. Even as you're flying around the kit, remember to keep breathing. It sounds like a silly thing to remember, but many young drummers instinctively hold their breath when things get difficult, which freezes them up and slows down their muscles.Don't tense up your muscles to force yourself to move faster. Keep your joints loose and relaxed.

, Remember, your audience will be entertained if you take them on a journey. Creating soft, quiet moments will make the intense moments much more powerful, as they will be noticeably more forceful compared to the softer playing right before it.


Remember that you can use dynamics on every single piece of the kit, from floor toms to crash cymbals.
How smoothly can you ratchet up tension? Try playing a roll on a snare or cymbal, starting from almost silent and transitioning smoothly into the loudest you can play., Playing in an uncommon time signature (e.g. 7/8 or 3/2) sounds impressive in your drum solo, provided you know what you are doing. Feel free to switch time signatures abruptly in your solo to add a new feel, vibe, or spice to what you're playing. Mix it up and be creative -- just make sure you can get back to ""normal"" by the end.


This is a common jazz trick by artists from Buddy Rich to Dave Weckl, but even rock drummers use it. Check out Brian Setzer Orchestra's ""Rock This Town,"" for a swing-rock example., Even if you leave the strict ""1, 2, 3, 4"" count, you are still in charge of keeping time for the band. When the solo is over you need to slip back into rhythm or else the band will be in complete rhythmic disarray. The best way to practice this is to play to a metronome. You can leave the beat for a while, but make sure you land right back in time with the machine when you're done.

, While a great solo is within the reach of most drummers, you won't improve if all you do is beat and bash on the drums each day. To become a better soloist, you need to spend 15-30 minutes every day on the basic, boring technical skills that make up any good drummer's arsenal. Think of it this way -- even the best-planned solo will fall flat if the notes themselves are sloppy, inconsistent, or off time.


Search online for ""rudiments,"" which are small drum licks that are meant to be repeated over and over again to build technical skills.Practice to a metronome every day, even when you're not playing solos. Remember that, on stage, you need to be the rest of the band's metronome, too., Even if you're a heavy metal drummer, you can learn tons from famed jazz drummers like Art Blakey, Max Roach, and Buddy Rich. The inverse is true too, as even classic drummers can pick up pointers from the likes of John Bonham and Chad Smith. Each drummer has a unique way of approaching solos, and most famous drummers have trained or played in a variety of bands. Getting as good as these guys is about absorbing new techniques and new influences."

Start off with your dominant hand (the one that plays the ride cymbal) on the ride and your feet alternating.,
Once you can play this at a decent speed, add the snare drum.,
Begin getting it faster and faster and you are good to go!

,
If you only have single bass pedal, you're probably going to have more luck with the traditional method:

,
Hit the bass drum and high-hat together on each beat (right leg and right hand together).,
If you need even more speed then try hitting the bass pedal twice in rapid succession.",How to Play Blast Beats on the Drums," So whenever you hit your cymbal, one of your feet hits the bass drum.;
, So essentially you will be playing 16th notes with your hands and 8th notes with your feet. Just make sure your hand playing the ride is in unison with your feet and the snare should land in between.(Sounds a bit like a polka when played slowly.)

,,, Between these beats hit the snare. (Effectively you are alternating bass-snare very quickly. The high-hat gives the illusion of greater speed).

, This can be done using the heel-toe technique, although this technique works much better on a Long board pedal.

"
"
Before you can start, make sure you are comfortable with holding drum sticks (check out ""How to Hold Drum Sticks"") and own a practice pad or drum.,
Understanding the basics.,
Traditional Method.,
While that way is often seen as the more correct way of learning, it's also very slow and there is another way.,
Start by learning to make the stick bounce.,
Once each hand gets good at this, start alternating your ""bounces"".

,
Control your bounces.,
Speed up your double bounces.,
Clean up your rolls.,
Keep your rolls open, meaning let the bounces be higher off the drum head (1-3 inches).,
Double Stroke Rolls can be broken into smaller rolls: fours, fives, sixes, sevens, nines, tens, elevens, fifteens, seventeens being some of the more common ones.",How to Play a Double Stroke Roll,";
, Double Stroke Rolls, when done by more advanced drummers, will be two distinct strokes on each hand, steadily getting faster until a roll is produced. The better you are, the less bouncing is required to get that fast. As a beginner, there's almost no way you could just play a perfect double stroke roll.

, Some teachers have students begin to learn the Double Stroke Roll by starting with double strokes (right right, left left; also called ""pa-pa ma-ma""). In this method, you should start slow and get faster until your reach a breaking point (when you can no longer maintain speed or the correct sticking). You should practice your rolls slow and then fast, holding your speed just below your breaking point for a minute or so. Every time you practice, you should try to increase your speed and move past your breaking point.

, The benefits of this way usually allow you to start playing an effective (though messier) roll. This can be helpful if you want to start working on other songs while you're practicing. You'll also be practicing and improving your rolls in a practical way, rather than focusing solely on rolls and not at all on music.

, What is meant by ""bounce"" is that you hit the drum only once but the stick should produce several sounds. Often one hand is much better at this than the other.


It is difficult to get the hang of this at first. It requires finding a balance between pressing the stick down to keep it bouncing and releasing pressure to keep from ""crushing"" the stick into the drum.
In general, you want your stick to make between 2-5 hits and keep it about an inch off the drum. Closer than that, and it sounds too ""crushed"", kind of dead sounding. Much higher, and that means that you're probably not in a lot of control of what you're sticks are doing.

,, After a while, you'll be more comfortable with your bounces and it will start to feel more natural. At this point you want to learn how to stop the bounce after two hits (remember a double stroke roll should have only two hits per hand).


Tip: don't try to ""snatch"" your stick away to end the bounce quickly, simply add some pressure to stop the stick from moving.
When you practice this, make sure you're not manually making two hits, that would be defeating the purpose.

, Again, spend a lot of time getting used to this and getting your double bounces fast (really fast- to the point where there isn't a pause between each sound). At this point you could start learning different Double Stroke Rolls and should be able to effectively play them in songs. Remember, however, that until you learn to clean them up, they may not sound as crisp or as clean as you may want them.

, At this point, your wrists and hands will have loosened up and your muscles will have gained both muscle memory and endurance. This is when you can try the more ""standard"" way of learning double strokes.


Start by making two hits on each hand, starting slow and getting faster. Because you've been working on bouncing and developing your skills, you should be able to go much faster than you originally would have been able to. Despite your practice, you'll still hit a breaking point, however you can push through that breaking point by using bouncing.
Every time you practice, try to make your strokes go faster (get faster before resorting to bounces).

, It'll produce a cleaner sound.

,


There is a basic formula for knowing how many hand exchanges are needed for each roll.

Odd numbers: add 1, divide by 2 = hand exchanges. The last hand will make the end stroke.
Even numbers: divide by 2, add 1 = hand exchanges. The last two hands will make a stroke. (This end stroke is very quick).


All Double Strokes should end with an accented, definite stroke. If there are two or more rolls in a row, this is very important to make them distinct from each other.
You should raise your hands slightly before entering a roll- it will keep it from bleeding into the last thing you just played and will also force you to play into it more, making it crisper and cleaner.
Most double strokes should be alternated (one starting on the right hand, the next on the left hand). Even rolls are hard to alternate when played in a row, but you should be competent with them on both hands. Traditionally, however, sevens and sometimes fifteens are played only on the left hand (Ancient Fife and Drum, Civil War/Rev War/etc).

Design your drum kit.,
Decide what percussion you want.,
Decide if you want electronic pads.,
Buy the shells and hardware.,
Buy the necessary drum heads.,
Begin assembling the drums by attaching the lugs.,
Attach the remaining hardware.,
Fit the rims and heads onto each drum.,
Fit the snares onto the snare drum.,
Set up the drum kit according to your taste.",How to Make a Drum Kit," Before buying any parts or putting anything together, make a complete plan for your kit.


First, decide how many drums you want, along with the depth and diameter of each drum. At the least, you will want a snare drum and a bass drum, but adding a few toms will round out your kit.
You will also need to decide on the color of your drums' shells and hardware, and the wood used for the shells. Maple, birch, and beech are all common choices for drum shells.
You will need to decide on how any toms will be mounted; if you mount any toms to the bass drum, you will need the appropriate hardware to do so.;
, This means stuff like cowbells, agogo bells, wood blocks, jam blocks, temple blocks, wind chimes, triangles, orchestra bells, tubular bells, aux snares and hi-hats, special effects cymbals, etc.

, This can add a variety of sounds that you can't get from acoustic drums.

, There are several companies offering built-to-spec drum shells and hardware. When ordering, you will choose the wood and finish for each shell, and you can opt to have the holes pre-drilled for the hardware; this is a very good idea, because drilling a single hole in the wrong place can ruin a drum.


Each drum will need the following hardware: rims, tension rods with washers, and lugs. Toms will need mounts and arms, while bass drums will need spurs.
The snare drum will also need a strainer (also called a throw off), a butt, and a set of snares.
When buying shells, make sure that the bearing edges (the angled part where the rim meets the shell) are already planed. Planing them yourself would represent a major undertaking. The snare drum should also have the snare bed filed away.

, Before assembling the drums, you will need to have the heads ready. Make sure to buy 1 batter head (the top) and 1 resonant head (the bottom) for each drum.


Coated heads are ideal for snare drums, while clear heads work well for toms and bass drums.

, Position each lug against its pre-drilled hole and thread its bolt through both the lug and the drum shell. Fit the nut over the bolt on the inside of the shell and tighten it � do not over-tighten it, as this can cause the shell to crack. Repeat this process for each lug on every drum.

, The bass drum spurs, tom mounts, snare throw off, and snare butt will all attach in the same manner as the lugs � thread the bolt through and tighten it against the shell.

, Start by placing the drumhead over the shell. Lower the rim onto the head, and then fit each tension rod (with its washer) through the holes in the rim and into each lug. Tighten each tension rod as much as you can with only your fingers. From this point, tune the heads as you normally would, using a drum key.

, After the resonant head is fitted onto the drum, you can attach the snares. Loosen both the butt and the throw off with a drum key, and slide the ends of the snares into them (the ends will either be made from string or acetate). Tighten the butt and throw off, and then engage the throw off to position the snares against the resonant head. Adjust the tension as desired.

, Mount the toms appropriately, and place the snare drum in a stand.

"
"
Fill the bass drum with a pillow.,
Mute with plastic O-rings.,
Use mute pads.",How to Make a Drum Set Quieter1," Remove one of the bass drum heads and place a soft material such as a pillow or blanket inside the drum. The material must slightly touch both heads in order to achieve a muted sound. Once you've replaced the head you removed, re-tune the drum. The pillow will deaden many of the bass drum's overtones, resulting in a quieter, more muffled sound.


Music stores also sell specially designed muting pillows for bass drums. These pillows come in a variety of weights and sizes, allowing you to adjust the level of deadening in the drum.;
, Tom and snare drums can be deadened using plastic O-rings. These rings are placed along the top of the drums and help absorb some of the vibrations created when a drum is struck. As a result, the sound created by these drums will ring less, offering a more manageable sound.


Drum gel may also be used in a similar fashion to O-rings. These are small adhesive gel packs that can be placed on the toms and snare to mute the drum.
Other DIY options for muting the snare and toms include covering portions of the drum with fabric such as an old shirt, heavy duty tape (such as duct), or gum!, Mute pads are placed entirely over the top of the drums (or cymbals) and almost completely deaden the sound of the drums. This makes mute pads ideal for perfecting hand technique or rhythm, but not a great choice when you need to actually hear how the drum will sound.


Using mute pads also alters the rebound of the drum, causing your drumming to feel different."
"
Install sound insulation.,
Construct a room specifically for playing drums.,
Set a drum screen around your kit.",How to Make a Drum Set Quieter2," Acoustic panels or drywall padding can make the sound produced by drums far less likely to bleed through the room that houses the kit. However, sound insulation is expensive, and often requires a fair amount of work and restructuring of the room itself.Cheaper options for soundproofing your room include sound absorbing strips that can be placed along the ceiling, the bottom of doors, and walls.
If you can't afford acoustic foam, hang blankets or quilts on your walls. The fabric may not be ideal, but will help absorb the sound.

, Further sound insulation to a room requires more exhaustive changes to the structure of the room, such as decoupling the sheetrock from the wall framing. Contact a carpenter (and your landlord) if you plan on making such changes.


Make sure the doors and windows are sealed properly to keep sound from escaping.
Sound-isolated rooms built correctly are airtight, so ventilation is a must for such rooms. Makes sure you look for a ventilation system that doesn’t compromise your sound isolation., Drum screens, also called drum shields, redirect the sounds created by drums. The hinged plastic sheets can be angled to direct the sound exactly where you desire, such as away from your parents' bedroom. Drum screens are useful for practice, but note that the overall sound produced will be different than an open drum.


Remember that these screens redirect sound – often reverberating right back into your ears. Invest in some ear buds to save your hearing when using a shield.
Try coupling the shield with any sound absorbing material you’ve placed in your room. Aim the shield so that the sound is redirected into the material."
"
Purchase an electronic drum kit.,
Purchase a practice drum pad kit.,
Use drum brushes.,
Pick up some bundle sticks.",How to Make a Drum Set Quieter3," These sets can easily be equipped with headphones to allow the player to hear the drums while keeping overall noise to a minimum. This is a great option if you don’t mind trading sound quality for convenience.


Electric drum sets often come with additional features that make them a worthy choice, even if you already have an acoustic drum set, such as the ability to easily record your music.
Electronic drum sets also feature volume controls, allowing you to play them at a low volume, even without headphones., Practice drum pads are made of a rubber material and can be arranged in a fashion that resembles a full drum kit, bass drum included. Unlike an electronic drum kit, the practice drum pad is not capable of sound resembling a normal drum kit. However, the rubber construction allows drum sticks to rebound in a fashion very much like an actual drum set.


Drum pads are great if you have very little room to spare, but still wish to practice your hand technique. Set one up on a cymbal stand to practice, and buy a full kit when you have the room to spare., Drum brushes are drum sticks with heads consisting of nylon filaments. They are used for softer playing, as well as with certain drumming techniques. Note that these will have no effect on the volume of your bass drum.


Drum brushes don’t work particularly well on closed hi-hats, so plan your practice session ahead., Bundle sticks are similar to drum brushes, but made of wood or a similar harder material. They produce a louder sound than drum brushes, while retaining the feel and sound of standard drumsticks.


If bundle sticks are too loud, try coupling them with a mesh drum cover or other deadening method."

Assess your current cymbal setup.,
Match the new cymbal's tone to your existing cymbals.,
Decide on a cymbal size.,
Test cymbals in a retail environment if possible.",How to Choose a New Cymbal for Your Drums," Before buying a new cymbal, you need to take a look at your existing setup. This will help you determine what kind of cymbal would best fill in your setup. There are 2 aspects in particular you should examine: the types of cymbals you have, and their quality.


Begin by examining your cymbals' quality. If you have inexpensive sheet bronze cymbals - that is, cymbals that were punched from a sheet of metal - you may want to replace your existing cymbals with higher quality ones before expanding your setup. Cast bronze cymbals, which are made by pouring molten metal into a mold, are more expensive but sound much better and last longer. If you want to record your music, having high quality cymbals is a good idea.
Next, examine the types of cymbals that you have. The 2 most basic types are the hi-hats (actually consisting of 2 cymbals, top and bottom) and the ride cymbal. If you don't have either of these, choose this as your new cymbal. The next most useful cymbal is a crash, often of a versatile size such as 16 inches (40 cm). If you already have 1 or 2 crash cymbals, you can look at buying a more specialized cymbal like a splash or China cymbal.;
, Cymbal manufacturers such as Zildjian, Paiste, and Sabian produce cymbals in different series. Each series corresponds to a different general tonal quality, and it is best to match the tones of all the cymbals in your setup. For example, if your current cymbals are from the very dark ""K"" series from Zildjian, you should avoid buying a new cymbal from the very bright ""AAX"" series from Sabian.

, Cymbals are sized by their diameters, and larger sizes produce deeper pitches and louder, more sustained tones. In fact, the main thing that differentiates high-pitched, punchy splash cymbals from louder and lower crash cymbals is their size. If your drumming style is loud and aggressive, opt for larger sizes for crash, splash, and effects cymbals. If your style is tighter and cleaner, opt for smaller sizes.

, Of course, picking from a specific series and set of sizes is no substitute for actually hearing cymbals firsthand. Musical instrument stores often have many of the most popular models on display for testing. If you are seriously considering buying a particular model, ask if you can set it up with a drum set so that you can hear how it sounds in the context of real playing.

Remove excess glue.,
Sand the shells.,
Paint the shells (optional).,
Tape.,
Stain.,
Polyurethane.,
Powder coating (optional).,
Reassemble.,
Rock On!",How to Overhaul Your Drum Kit," The first part of re-doing your kit is to start taking it apart. Take off the rims and the skins with the drum key, leaving the shell of the drum with the hardware attached to it. With the Phillips head screwdriver, remove the screws on the inside of the drum – the drum lugs should fall right off leaving only the wood shell with the vinyl wrap on it. Make sure to put all of the hardware form each drum into its own bag. Stay organized so that when you re-assemble your drum it can be done easily.;
, This step requires some dexterity. The vinyl wrap on your drums has been glued on with adhesive, so ripping it off too quickly can leave gouges in your shell. To safely remove the vinyl, first find the seam where the vinyl wrap is glued together. Then, take a hair dryer, turn it up as hot as possible, and point it at the seam. The vinyl wrap should start to bubble up and fall off. IT WILL BE HOT, so use pliers to slowly pull the vinyl wrap away from the shell. Continue to use the hair dryer and pliers to heat up and pull off the entire vinyl shell.

, There will most likely be some gunk on the shell from the glue – especially where the seam was. Take the hair dryer and a paint scraper and melt/scrape away the glue.

, Sand the shells of the drums until they are completely smooth. Be sure to use 220 girt or lighter sandpaper, as anything heavier can damage the shell.

, Paint a cool design on the shells. It may be a good idea to use a stencil or to outline the design with chalk to before you paint.

, Tape up the bearing edges and the holes where the hardware was before you apply any stain or polyurethane.

, Take your preferred color of stain and stain the shell using a foam brush. The more you use, the darker it will be. Stain will run very quickly, so start out using small amounts!

, Apply a large amount of polyurethane. Using a foam brush (NOT the same one you used for the stain!), apply even strokes on the shell. Let the Polyurethane dry for about 4 hours, then take some light sandpaper and gently sand the dried polyurethane. Wipe the dust off, and apply a new layer. Repeat this step several times.

, Depending on what your stain/paint job looks like, you may want to get your hardware powder coated. This is a complex process that is usually best left to professionals. Find an instrument shop near you and bring in your drums to have them powder coated.

, Once the polyurethane has dried and the drums have been powder coated (if you chose to powder coat), put your hardware back on the drum shells and put the drum heads and the rims back on.

, Your drums are now refurbished and ready to be played!

, The drum head is the head that is not struck by the pedal. Use a razor blade and cut somewhere between the rim and the center of the drum. Use a bowl or coffee can to outline the cut. A bigger hole results in less resonance., Cut a strip of cloth about 4 inches (10 cm) wide. Secure the strip against the drum head by tightening the ends inside the tuning rim. The strip is usually set to the left or right side of the drum head, not in the center."

Master double bass synchronization.",How to Improve Your Drumming Skills," Practice and master basic drum rudiments like the single (RLRL LRLR) and double stroke rolls (RRLL LLRR).


Incorporate these in your practice routine, even if it feels monotonous because perfecting your basics is the key that helps you unlocks complex beats and play them with ease.
Many drummers, in their impatience to play complex rhythms fail to dedicate enough time to practicing the basics. Because of this they never get the technique right and often sound like amateurs even after years of playing.;
, Your practice time needs to be a focused, solo ritual that gives you the space and freedom to experiment with different beats and rhythms as well as with different playing styles. It allows you to work on and improvise your technique and practice the rudiments. A jam session on the other hand is an opportunity for you to apply the techniques that you have been working on in your practice sessions


Most drummers allocate enough time to jamming sessions but hardly reserve time for focused practice sessions. Thus schedule different times for practice and for jamming. And this will help you concentrate on developing your independent style, manage your speed and have better control on your feet and sticks., Having a catalogue of parameters to focus on will help you evaluate and track your progress. This was a famous tip given by Benny Gerb. When practicing a technique multiple times or a paradiddle for that matter, things can get extremely boring and you might find your concentration wavering, however if you constantly have a set of parameters that you can measure yourself against it will help you focus your attention and listen to the sound in order to master consistency.


Benny Greb in fact posed a few of the parameters to measure yourself with. For example-how much less muscle motion can you use to get the same effect? How is it, time-wise? Do you breathe enough? Are you able to focus long enough or do you dream away? What do you think about? Things like that. If you do all these things then it's the technique that I talk about it and it's much more than just moving your muscles., It is common for drummers to practice the same techniques, rudiments and grooves over and over without realizing. The lack of experimenting actually kills creativity as you become accustomed to and comfortable with a particular set of beats, which you automatically resort to.


The best way to avoid this is to record your practice sessions and maintain a progress journal. This will help you keep track of your problem areas and help you move from practicing what you already know to trying out different routines.
Remember your log book is also your personal music diary. It will help you identify your problem areas and chances are once you know these you will be able to overcome them more easily in your next practice sessions.

, Practicing on the drum set diligently and regularly is ideal but can get cumbersome and eventually lead to boredom. Introducing a temporary aid or a new method into existing routines would help keep things interesting and motivate further development.

, When first learning the swing beat, it is learnt in the basic triplet blues format. This may then be extended into its eighth note relative for the more classic rock ballad vibe. However, in order to understand the ‘feel’ of the swing, you should attempt to feel the swing in quarter note pulses. This may result in the changes becoming more difficult to discern and force you to make minute changes in time.


Master drummers are usually be able to manipulate this feel and play their groove slightly ahead of the pulse to make the song sound more driven or play it just behind the pulse for a lazy groovy rhythm. This technique requires solid foundation of your sense of time and practicing it helps a drummer incorporate a sense of groove and feel to support the song which even when played at blisteringly fast tempos, can help them keep the song in the pocket easily.

, This is one of the best kept secrets of the industry. It is said that both Thomas Lang and Virgil Donati practiced with ankle weights to develop their speed and control.


Try wearing weights as you practice the heels-up and heels-down. Once you remove them after 20-30 minutes of practice, besides the floating feeling in your feet, you will also be much faster and more at ease on the pedals.

, This lets you play doubles with ease, speed and precision that cannot be achieved without it.


Use it with two pedals to play double strokes , and on one pedal for quick hand to feet combinations., The secret of achieving single stroke speed on double pedals lies in finding the correct spot on both pedals. It's like a fulcrum point or the balance point on a drumstick which ensures least amount of effort.  It is important for both your feet to play the same balance point and not have one foot different than the other. Practicing this will ensure that you are able to synchronize your singles at high speed, which most drummers find very difficult to do due to lack of feet synchronization early on.

Place dampening gel on the batter head of your snare or tom drum.,
Put a drum ring on top of your snare or tom drum.,
Put a strip of duct tape on the batter head.",How to Dampen Drums2," A few companies offer these small gel pads, which stick to the drum head and offer light dampening. Put it in a spot where you will not hit it when you play.

Slowly run your thumb around the top of the drum in a circle, about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) from the rim, while striking the center of the drum. Take note of the position of your thumb when the drum muffles best - this is usually a good place to stick the gel.
Move the gel around and listen to the different timbres you create by placing the gel in certain spots. Add another gel pad or two if you want more muffling.
If you find the gel to dampen more than you'd like, most muffling gels can easily be ripped into smaller pieces.
In a scenario where the use of muffling gel is for a temporary function such as recording, be sure to put the gel back in its case, as it will dry out and lose its stickiness.

, Drum rings are usually about 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide, made of thin plastic, and rest around the diameter of the drum. Although these rings are available in music stores, you can make your own by cutting a circle from the outer edge of an old drum head with a razor blade., Experiment with different lengths of tape to find the right sound."

, Stick your tongue out slightly, just the tip, and scrape the paper off your tongue quickly and spit it away from your mouth. Your lips should catch each other, creating a sound similar to a 'raspberry'.

, After assembling it fully, inhale through your mouth, assume the proper lip position, put the instrument up to your lips, and vibrate using your lips, making the buzzing sound. Don't push any valves yet. You should feel your lips change tightness as they lock into a note. Don't push the valves yet!








, Note that valves are numbered one through three. Valve number one is closest to you, and valve number three is toward the bell of the horn. The note should be higher.









Congratulations! You've now played your first two notes on a trumpet!

, If you buzz into your mouthpiece correctly, you should be able to make a coherent sound. It may sound a lot like Donald Duck, but that is a good thing. If you sound like Donald, you're doing something right.








, A scale is an ascending or descending collection of pitches proceeding by a specified scheme of intervals.








, Go to http://www.musikit.com/Merchant2/SOUND/Midi/Bb3.mid. Play this note on your trumpet while pushing no valves down. That note is C.








, Play note D. If you can't play D, try barely tightening your lips.








, Tighten your lips a little more, and play note E: http://www.musikit.com/Merchant2/SOUND/Midi/D4.mid.








, Tighten your lips a little more, an http://www.musikit.com/Merchant2/SOUND/Midi/Eb4.mid .








, Instead, tighten your lips some more, and play note G: http://www.musikit.com/Merchant2/SOUND/Midi/F4.mid.








,, Tighten your lips a little more, and play note B: http://www.musikit.com/Merchant2/SOUND/Midi/A4.mid.








,, You just played your first C scale on a trumpet. This is also called the ""Concert B flat"" scale, but you will learn more about that when you get a music book.









Next it's a good idea to learn Concert E flat scale. This scale has higher notes, and may be harder at first. But with practice, persistence, and some help from a pro, you could get the high notes well. After you get the E flat scale, move on to higher-or lower-scales.

, Try to practice every day for at least 15 minutes, although it is recommended that you practice about an hour a day, once you have the stamina for it. When you start off, and especially when you only have one scale to play, fifteen minutes should be plenty.








, Follow its instructions beyond what you've learned here. What you've learned here is only one of twelve scales; the book should teach you at least one or two, and many songs, before you move on to another, or sheet music. Good luck! The trumpet is a great instrument that takes a whole lot of practice to play it well.


A great book to begin with is Rubank Elementary Methods for B flat Trumpet or Cornet, or a Getchell. Ask the store clerk for either of these.

Remove the mouthpiece of your cornet.,
Replace the mouthpiece on the cornet.,
Now that you have a hold on your cornet, put it back to your lips with the mouthpiece half on the upper lip as it was before.,
Press valves 1 and 3.,
Press valves 1 and 2 for an E. As before, tighten your lips even more for this note.,
Now let's go back down.,
Once you're comfortable playing the notes, you need to know how to ""tongue"".,
Now, perform steps 3-6 on the cornet again.",How to Play a Cornet," It should come out with a simple tug. Place the mouthpiece on your lips, half on the upper, half on the lower. Some argue that it should be two-thirds on the lower, but that does not matter at this stage. With the mouthpiece on your lips, ""buzz"" your lips. It should sound something similar to a swarm of bees.;
, Put your right hand on the keys so your pointer finger is on the first key, the middle finger is on the second key, and the ring finger is on the third key. The pinky will go in the ring and the thumb should grasp the casing of the first valve. Your left hand will also grasp the valve casings, but the pinky will go in the third valve slide ring.

, Buzz your lips with all valves up. Most likely, you just played the low C.

, Buzz again, but this time, tighten your lips a bit. That is a D.

, Press only valve 1 for F. For G, leave all valves up, but tighten your lips even more.

, Play G. Loosen your lips a little and play F. Loosen them some more and play E. Keep going to low C.

, The basic idea is to tap your tongue on the roof of your mouth while you're playing. Play a low C and hold it. Now, tongue as described. If it helps say ""TA"" or ""DA"" while you tongue.

, This time, however, tongue at the beginning of each note. Repeat until you are comfortable with it.

Get the right equipment.,
Join a jazz band.,
Dissect your time signature.,
Swing notes in traditional music.,
Syncopate your scales.,
Figure out improvisation.,
Pin down the basics of each jazz style.,
Listen to great jazz performers.,
Develop your own style.",How to Play Jazz Trumpet," Typically, trumpeters don’t jump straight into playing jazz music. It’s essential that you develop basic trumpet playing skills first. Take trumpet lessons or join a band to improve your basic skills. Trumpet instructors can provide you with all the basic trumpet playing methods and help you develop the necessary skills to play trumpet in general and jazz music in specific. No matter how you’re learning to play, practice every day.


It’s recommended that musicians serious about improving or maintaining their trumpeting skills practice at least one hour a day.
If you want to get better at playing jazz, you need to make jazz music part of your daily practice schedule.;
, This term is used to reference any song that’s considered necessary for every jazz musician’s repertoire. Many jazz musicians memorize these tunes, so if they’re ever given the opportunity to play with a band, they can “sit in” on a standard. Start by listening to some of the jazz standards performed by some of your favorite jazz trumpeters. Then, you can start playing standards yourself. The Fake Book or Real Book series are both popular with jazz musicians, and they include a number of jazz standards for a variety of skill levels. Incorporate some of your favorites into your daily practice routine.


Ask a trumpet instructor to help you with your style on some of your favorite jazz standards.
Keep listening to these standards performed by other trumpet players, and try to mimic their style. You can even buy jazz standards you can play along with., This skill is essential to excelling as a musician playing any instrument. Sight reading is playing a song through the first time you see it. This should be done on a regular basis to improve your skill, but sight-reading jazz music is particularly important. The faster you’re able to play the notes on the page, the faster you’ll be able to incorporate jazz techniques, improvise, and have fun playing any song.


Start by looking through key and time signatures and making note of where they change. Some players highlight or circle these changes in their music.
Next, take a few moments to practice fingering for any runs that may be particularly quick or difficult. Most likely, you’ll want to finger eight and sixteenth notes.
Finally, play through the song without stopping, no matter how much you mess up. Try to remember the areas where you struggled, and go back and play these individually., The vernacular of jazz is different than that of concert band, so if you’re used to these terms, you may need to add jazz terminology to your vocabulary. Basic slang terms include ""horns"" for wind instruments, ""rhythm"" for the drum and guitar sections, ""chart"" for song, ""lead"" for first parts, “improvisation” for solos, and “licks” for runs of notes, especially eight and sixteen note runs.


Like building other types of vocabulary, sitting down with a jazz dictionary and learning every term may not be effective. Instead, take time to ask an instructor or band mate or consult other resources as you come across words you’re unfamiliar with in your music.
You can also use online tools like Columbia University’s Jazz Glossary to find definitions of jazz terms you may see regularly., Once you begin to play jazz regularly, you’ll likely start to see notations in the music for special musical equipment. Jazz trumpet uses a wide array of tools such as plungers and a variety of mutes including Harmon, straight, cup, and bowler mutes. Talk to your local instrument shop, check online, and ask your trumpet instructor what types of specialty equipment you may need to play jazz trumpet., Possibly the fastest way to learn to play jazz music well is to play with a group of musicians. If you’re in school, you may be able to join your high school, college, or university jazz band. If you’re no longer a student, there may be opportunities for you to join a local jazz ensemble in your community. Playing in a jazz band gives you a built-in group of people to learn from, and who can provide feedback to help you improve more quickly than you can on your own.


You can find a jazz band to join by asking friends who are musicians, looking online for local groups, or you can form your own jazz band with a group of friends.
If you’re having trouble finding a band to join, consider posting advertisements through online forums or social media for local musicians who would like to start a jazz ensemble.

, The ability to mentally break down each measure of music into its component parts is essential to playing jazz music. You should especially train your ear to hear the up and down beats of the measure, as these are essential in order to “swing” notes in the standard jazz style. Early in your training, you should be instructed to keep time by tapping your toe, so up and down beats are probably fairly obvious to you. You tap your toe in eighth notes, and keep time by counting one and, two and, three and, etc., depending on time signature. The “one” is the up beat. The “and” is the down beat.


The best players don’t just hear this breakdown, but can also hear the sixteenth notes between the eighth notes, and learn to play these skillfully.
Triplets are commonly played in jazz music, and when performed properly give the trumpet line a waltz feel to it that can add texture to the music. Rather than splitting a quarter note in half as an eight note, triplets dissect the quarter notes into threes., This is the “do-wah” rhythm that characterizes jazz music. A great way to learn how to swing notes is to play a non-jazz song with swung notes. Typically, jazz standards call for swung eighth notes. To swing eighth notes, slightly elongate the first note and shorten the second.


In a non-jazz song you’re familiar with, swing all the eighth notes. You’ll elongate the note on the up beats (the “one/two/three” etc. of the count), and shorten the notes on the down beats (the dividing “and” note of the count)., In traditional music, unless otherwise noted, each note receives the same amount of emphasis. Syncopation creates musical interest by emphasizing the down beats of music. This is a natural progression from the swing style. You’ve already changed the count of eighth notes slightly. Then, you add extra emphasis on the shortened down beat to further enhance the unique swing sound. Practice syncopation by playing scales as syncopated eighth notes.


Adding extra air support to the syncopated note is the most common way to make it just slightly more intense than the un-syncopated up beat note.
You can also use plungers and mutes to create the syncopated sound. By inserting the mute or closing the plunger over your bell on the un-syncopated note and opening up the bell on the syncopated note, you’ll create emphasis., This is the most difficult part of jazz for beginning players. Learning to read the music and play the notes is simple. Creating your own music that fits within the song is much more difficult. When starting out, you may need to write out a solo in advance, but as you continue to develop your improvisational skills, the notes will come more quickly and naturally.


An easy starting point for jazz improvisation is to play the same note within the key of the solo. Rather than changing notes, change the rhythm.
Determine the number of measures you’ll need to play, and count the measures so you’ll know when the solo has ended.
Be flexible. Even if you write out the notes of your solo before hand, allow yourself to make changes where necessary., You need to understand the different forms of jazz. Most jazz songs will note their style at the top of the page. Look for something like swing, blues, Latin, or funk below the title. If you’re not sure what style the music should be played in, try to find a recording of the song. If you’re playing as a member of band or jazz ensemble, it’s likely your director or other band member who chose the song will have input about the basic style.The sound that differentiates jazz from other types of music is the swing rhythm that creates the characteristic “do-wah” sound of jazz. Swing also calls for the syncopation of eighth notes with an emphasis on the down beats.
Latin or Afro-Cuban jazz is another common style. Latin jazz was developed in the 1950s, and is a culmination of various cultural sounds. Usually much faster than traditional jazz, Latin jazz is characterized by bright tones, and un-syncopated eighth notes.
Other common forms of jazz include funk and rock. There are also many derivatives of these styles, such as swung rock or funky Latin., Get some recordings of jazz players and study how they play. The best way to learn the styles of jazz is to listen to them performed by the masters. Then, take what you hear and incorporate it into your own performance.


Louis Armstrong offers examples of traditional jazz trumpet playing.
Dizzy Gillespie is an icon of Latin and more progressive jazz.
Wynton Marsalis offers a range of performance styles, and is a master of improvisation and high note range., Jazz music, possibly more than any other style, has always been about expressing individual personality and ability. Once you’ve studied and listened to the various existing jazz styles, the logical next step is to make one that is all your own. For many players, this happens naturally as part of improvisation while soloing. Others consciously make choices to play darker notes, wail on the upper register, or mix jazz styles to create their own personal fusion.


This is not something even the best trumpet instructor can teach you. You just have to invest the time to practice and find the right sound.
Don’t hesitate to mimic the jazz trumpeters you enjoy listening to, but don’t shy away from taking their sound somewhere new and different."

After you pick up the horn, take about three deep trumpet breaths, then place your mouthpiece at your mouth.,
Using a piano if your ear is not good enough, play one note on the mouthpiece only, followed by the note one step above it.,
Play three notes up, 5 notes up, and back down and try to play a scale.,
Place the mouthpiece in the horn now.

,
Blow through the horn for about 1 minute without playing any notes.,
Begin playing with some major scales, using long tones.,
Begin playing arpeggios (1-3-5-8).,
By this time you should be quite warm.,
Start by playing the G (concert F) right above the staff.,
Work on expanding your range through lip slurs.,
Repeat!,
When you get to the highest note that you can play, just tongue and play it over and over and over again.,
Try buzzing your lips together to mimic the sound of a trumpet.,
Try breathing in 4 beats and releasing air in 4.,
Try breathing in for 2 beats and releasing for as long as you can.",How to Play High Notes on the Trumpet," Blow through the mouthpiece until you get a buzz going using the least amount of air and energy.;
, Continue this for a maximum of two minutes.

, You may also want to do a siren, where you are going from the middle of your range to the bottom, to the top, back to the middle. Try to do this without any breaks. Don't force it. If you can't play the higher notes, don't work too hard. They will come with practice.

,, Make sure you're taking deep breaths and exhaling with ease. Use warm air. Also be sure to keep the airflow constant. Don't pause after the inhale.

, Start with the C (concert Bb) scale, working your way up to the next major scale. Do this for 5-10 minutes.

, Again start at C (concert Bb) and work your way up. Perform this for 2-5 minutes.

, If not, do some lip slurs, going no higher than E (concert D) at the top of the staff.

, If you have a metronome, set it at 60 beats per minute. Hold that note for 4 beats (equivalent to 4 seconds) and then proceed up a half step every 2 beats until you reach high C (concert Bb). Do this for 2-5 minutes. If this is too much, keep practicing up to this part until your chops have gotten strong enough to move on.

, Start on C (concert Bb) and slur up and down from there while keeping the same fingering. Keep your slur slow so you can center each note as it's played. Gradually work up the scale, by half-step, as high as you're able to play.

, One time isn't good enough. This takes consistent practice. You will begin to lose strength if you rest for more than two days. Persistence is crucial while expanding your range.

, This is very tedious work, but the payoff is excellent, you will build the muscles needed to play that note every time you play it, so, make a little rhythm, whatever you need to make it, just a little interesting.

, Get tighter until you reach the highest pitch buzz that you can make. Keep that same embouchure and put the line in between your lips at the lowest playable section of your mouthpiece (screamers and shallow mouthpieces help a lot). Now blow some good, fast air and hear how high you can play.

, Then 3 beats of air inhaled and 4 beats of releasing air. 2 beats of air inhaled and 4 beats of releasing air. Lastly, 1 beats of air inhaled and 4 beats of releasing air.

, Use a stopwatch to time how long you can release.

Consider the way in which you'll be using the drum set.,
Assess the feel of the set's pads.,
Determine whether the drum kit is multi-zone or single-zone.,
Check to make sure the drum module has a built-in amplifier and headphone jack.,
Assess the functionality of the drum module.,
Purchase your electronic drum set.",How to Buy an Electronic Drum Set," If you just need the drum set for home practice, you can chiefly concern yourself with how the set feels and plays rather than how sophisticated its electronic module is. To use drums for recording or performance, you will need to pay more careful attention to the degree of control you have over the module. Check the module for various connections, including a MIDI output and a USB output. Check the drum set specs to see if the module allows each pad to be mapped individually to a separate sound, which will give you more complete control over your drum set's sound.;
, Electronic drum sets typically have pads made from either rubber, mesh, or a cheaper material like plastic. Rubber pads are very durable, but don't provide a very realistic response due to the high amount of stick rebound. Mesh pads perform better, but are more expensive. Cheaper plastic pads should be avoided.

, Single-zone kits only have 1 sensor (or ""trigger"") per pad. Therefore, a single-zone crash cymbal will produce the same tone whether you play it on its edge or on the bell. These kits are cheaper, but don't provide the more realistic response of a multi-zone kit. At the least, you should ensure that the snare drum pad is dual-zone, so that it can produce both regular strikes and rim shots.

, While you may want to use an external amplifier for recording applications, you still want to make sure you have a way to quickly plug in a set of headphones and hear yourself play. This option is crucial for silent practice as well.

, The module is the part of the electronic drum set that actually handles the signals and turns them into sounds. A cheap practice set will not need anything other than the most basic functions. However, for recording applications, make sure that the module will work well with your recording software or digital audio workstation (DAW). This means offering the right connections and offering flexibility over each drum pad's sensor. Being able to individually adjust the volume, sensitivity, and sound of each sensor is crucial to recording high-quality audio.

, After considering what is important to you, you can browse drum sets at music retailers or online stores. Some of the top manufacturers of electronic drums are Roland, Pintech, and Yamaha. Make sure to read the specifications carefully for each set to make sure it has the features you want.

Choose a valve oil.,
Avoid silicone-based oils.,
Do not use home-based oils.,
Position your trumpet.,
Oil the valves one at a time.,
Add drops of oil.,
Coat the valve with oil.,
Place the valve into its correct position.,
Replace the valve cap.,
Check the air flow.,
Oil the valves frequently.",How to Oil Trumpet Valves," Valve oil helps clean and lubricate the trumpet, which will help you play your trumpet more efficiently, and can be purchased at most music stores or at various online retailers.There are two types of oils that are recommended to use for brass instruments: synthetic-based oils and petroleum-based oils. Deciding between the two is often a matter of personal preference and determining which works better with your instrument.


Petroleum-based oil works best with brand new trumpets. Petroleum oil is lighter and won’t be as effective on worn-in trumpets. You may have to reapply this oil more often if you use it on an older instrument.Synthetic oils are typically more expensive, but they are better able to reduce friction in tighter valves. In addition, these oils do not evaporate as quickly, so you may not need to oil your valves as regularly with this type of lubricant.Try various types and brands of valve oil to see which you prefer. Each person’s experience will be different, and the oil will react differently to each person’s saliva!Be sure not to mix the synthetic oils and petroleum-based oils together.;
, Some valve oils have added silicone or grease. These should be avoided. These oils can promote moisture build-up, which can cause corrosion on the trumpet’s pistons, casings, and slides.If an oil label states “shake well before use,” this could indicate that it is a silicone-based oil. Be sure to read the labels before buying a valve oil.

, Using WD-40, mineral oil, olive oil, or other oils found in your home are not recommended for oiling trumpet valves. Although it may be tempting to use these since they are typically easily accessible, it is wise to wait until you can buy proper valve oil. These home-remedies can severely damage a brass instrument., To begin, you may wish to place the trumpet on a flat surface to oil the valves, or you can hold the trumpet with one hand with your fingers wrapped around the valve casing. Whether you place it on a flat surface or hold it, be sure that the trumpet is secure so that you do not drop it and cause damage to the instrument. It is recommended that you oil the valves in a quiet place where there is not a lot of activity so the instrument won’t be accidentally knocked over., Unscrew the valve cap counter-clockwise, and place it to the side where you can easily access it later. With the cap successfully removed, slide the valve upward. Be sure the valve is up far enough so that you can see it, but do not completely remove the it from the instrument. Placing valves back into the instrument can be tricky if they are fully removed. , While you have the valve partially out of the casing, place a generous amount of oil at the bottom of the valve on the shaft. Do not worry about adding too much oil to the instrument. Although some do not like to over oil their trumpet, there has been no evidence to suggest that it will damage the instrument.Just be sure that the oil does not get in the holes and inside the trumpet.The valves may seem sticky after oiling if debris collects on the oil. To fix this, gently remove the valve and wipe it with a clean cloth. Be sure to re-oil the valve before inserting it back in the trumpet., After adding the oil to the valve, gently slide the valve up and down within its casing several times. This motion will help ensure that the valve and the valve casing are both adequately coated with oil. With sufficient and even lubrication, the valve action on the trumpet will be faster and smoother, making it easier and more enjoyable to play the instrument.

, Slide the valve down into the casing. Twist the valve clockwise until you hear the valve guide click back into place. After hearing the click, press the valve a few times to be sure that it works properly, is moving with easy, and that it is securely in place., With the valve securely back into place, return the valve cap and twist it clockwise so that it fits snuggly. The valve cap should be placed on the thread straight on. Make sure the cap is not at an angle while fastening it back into place. An angled cap can damage the threading and make it impossible to properly secure the cap during future oiling sessions.

, Blow into the trumpet to ensure that the air is correctly blowing through the instrument. If the valves are not placed back into their casings properly, the instrument will be impossible to play. If the air is not flowing through the trumpet, then the valves have most likely been secured incorrectly. Check the valves one at a time to see that they have been properly placed back into their respective slots.

, You do not need to oil the valves each time you play, but it is important to oil them 2-3 times each week or whenever the valves are not moving as efficiently as possible. This will help keep your instrument clean, improve the instrument's longevity, and help prevent corrosion. Not to mention, it will help make playing your instrument easier and more enjoyable!

Go to your local music dealer and ask about student rentals.,
While you're at the music store, you might also want to invest in a beginner's method book.,
Don't immediately open up the case and start noodling around.,
Take out your mouthpiece and buzz into there.,
Insert the mouthpiece into the trumpet.,
Rest the fingers of your right hand on the valves (which are numbered one, two and three, one being closest to you and three closest to the bell), and keep your right pinky either in the air or on top of the hook near the third valve.,
It's time to learn your first scale, the concert Bb (B flat) major scale, also called the C major scale.,
Gradually tighten up your mouth and use more air as you climb up the scale, as you can see that different notes are played with the same finger pattern.

,
Start looking in your method book and work on some easier songs, such as Hot Cross Buns and London Bridge.,
Seek a private instructor if you want extra help.,
Practice for at least 15 minutes a day for at least five days a week.",How to Play the Trumpet in a Day," Make sure the instrument is not dented and the slides and valves move freely. It may come from a nameless brand, but that's fine for starters. Make sure it's a ""B flat major"" trumpet, the most common kind and therefore, easiest to learn.;
, Those books normally come with accompaniment CDs, and also include scales, techniques for playing, and many beginner's pieces.

, Instead, close your mouth and press your lips together, crease the corners of your mouth and blow, making a buzzing sound. This is the embouchure, the way you form your mouth and lips.

, Do this every time you practice, as it gets you ready for playing and also improves your tone quality.

, Buzz into the mouthpiece again, but don't press any of the valves yet. Do that for a little while until you have the buzzing technique pretty much mastered.

, Hold the three valve casings with your left hand.

, You'll learn more about these in your method book. The fingerings, in order are:


Low C--No valves (often written as a zero)
D--Valves one and three
E--Valves one and two
F--Valve one
G--No valves
A--Valves one and two
B--Valve two
High C--No valves

,, Eventually, you will improve at playing. Also look in the back for a fingering chart, a glossary and also additional scales (there are twelve in total).

, Ask at a music shop or go online to see if there are any instructors in your area who give lessons.

, Begin with a warm up (buzzing in the mouthpiece, blowing warm air through the instrument, scales)and then work on the things that are hardest for you. Practice short lines of music at a time.

Whistle to learn how to control airflow in the higher registers.,
Use your diaphragm to move air.,
Support your breathing.",How to Improve High Range on Trumpet1," Many new trumpet players confuse blowing harder with blowing air faster. Blowing harder puts more air into the instrument and creates a louder sound. Faster air produces higher notes. One way to tell the difference is to whistle. Changing from a lower note to a higher note when whistling, you adjust the shape of the inside of your mouth and position of the tongue to direct the air more quickly. Mimicking this mouth and tongue position while playing trumpet will allow you to hit higher notes.Another method of practicing to hit high notes is to make an “ee” sound and feel the shape and position of the tongue in the mouth. This is also a position that will allow you to reach higher notes.;
, In addition to controlling air in the mouth, you also need to learn how to control your airflow from the lungs. For this, you’ll use the diaphragm, a flat muscle below your lungs. When you inhale, the diaphragm contracts to make room for the lungs. When you exhale, the diaphragm expands pushing the air out. Learning to control the movement of your diaphragm will make controlling the amount and speed of airflow much easier.Practice inhaling and exhaling slowly. Count to ten as you breathe in and feel your lungs fully expand and the diaphragm contract. Then, exhale for the same amount of time, paying special attention to the tightening of the diaphragm.
Without worrying about the quality of sound, inhale slowly and play a long note as you exhale. Inhale again, and this time, change the speed and quantity of air flow and note how it changes the pitch or quality of sound., The final step in controlling airflow is to make sure you are supporting the air. Players who are not effectively supporting airflow will play notes that waver or have poor tonal quality. You can practice air support by holding a piece of paper in front of your face. Then, you will blow on the paper. With proper air support, the paper should move outward at a consistent angle. Without air support, the paper, like the trumpet’s tone, will waver."

Understand the role your lips play.,
Stop your body from stiffening.,
Avoid pressing your lips too hard against the mouthpiece.,
Relax the upper lip.,
Learn the basic embouchure.,
Practice the Stevens embouchure.,
Try the Super Chops embouchure.",How to Improve High Range on Trumpet2," Embouchure, the position of the mouth while playing, is a key component to hitting and holding high notes. Your lips vibrate on the surface as you push air past them. This creates necessary resistance to direct the stream through the trumpet and make sound. Most players position their lower lip just under the upper lip, creating a seal. This seal prevents the lips from parting when players “buzz” their lips to play a note. This is especially important for high notes, where the fast air increases the risk that the seal will break and the note will crack or drop., Many trumpet players squeeze their lips more tightly together and tense their stomach muscles to hit high notes. This method may work once or twice, but the notes you produce will likely be of poor tonal quality, either flat or sharp. You need to learn to relax your mouth and body while playing high notes in order to achieve a clear high note tone., This can cause damage to your lips that may prevent you from practicing for a while, or it may even lead to irreversible damage. Like tensing up when you play, pressing your lips into the mouthpiece can allow you to play a higher note once or twice, but you will not be able to play notes consistently using this method., It’s especially important to stop yourself from stiffening the upper lip. This is the most often tensed part of the embouchure, and when you do this, you actually make it more difficult to reach high notes. The fast air moving between your lips causes vibration, but when you tense the mouth, the air is unable to move the lip and achieve the pitch you’re aiming for., Starting out, most trumpeters are taught the Farkas embouchure. You may remember early trumpet lessons where you were instructed to tighten the corners of your mouth, pinch lips together, and blow air through creating a buzzing sound. This is the Farkas method, and it is popular because it works. However, for higher notes, it may actually put too much strain on the lip muscles because the fast moving air wants to force the lips apart. Instead, you may want to consider adjusting to the Stevens or Super Chops embouchures.

, This method requires you to roll in either the upper or lower lip. This creates a tighter seal because one of your lips will slightly overlap the other, making it easier to keep lips together while increasing air speed to hit high notes.

, This method also overlaps the lips similarly to the Stevens embouchure. Instead of rolling the lip to accomplish this, the bottom lip remains flat and slides over the top teeth and under the top lip to create a seal."

Practice high notes every day.,
Play lip slurs.,
Adjust to stay on pitch.,
Ask fellow musicians for help.",How to Improve High Range on Trumpet3," You need to spend at least an hour each day playing the trumpet, but you shouldn’t dedicate more than ten percent of your playing time to high notes. That means if you practice for an hour a day, only six minutes of your practice should be devoted to improving your range. That’s because being able to effortlessly play notes in the mid range actually improves your high range. It’s twice as hard to play a C above the scale as it is to play the middle C tuning note. The easier it is for you to hit middle C, the easier it will be to play high C., Practicing lip slurs helps to develop your lip strength, and it is the key to learning and being able to maintain high notes. You can find lip slur exercises online, or you can do something as simple as slurring up and down a chromatic scale. In fact, slurring the chromatic scale is a great way to train your ear to hear sharpness and flatness on higher notes. Because you are playing a series of notes each just half a step apart, you should hear if one of the notes isn’t in tune., Playing high notes is a challenge, but playing high notes in tune can be even more difficult. When you’re working on your range, keep an electric tuner on your stand, and make adjustments to lip, tongue, and mouth position as well as airflow, if you notice your pitch becomes flat or sharp on high notes.


A good way to start is to slur up and down a chromatic scale. Because you are not tonguing to change the note, you really have to concentrate on adjusting the mouth and airflow to hit the notes.
You may also want to try playing a melody you’re familiar with up one or more octaves. Because your ear is already trained to recognize the melody, you are more likely to hear when the pitch goes sharp or flat.
You can also try out some trumpet standards that have high notes such as ""Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy"" or Chuck Mangione's classic ""Feels so Good."", When you're learning a new skill or sharpening skills you possess, it’s important to find a support system of other trumpet players. It’s sometimes difficult to assess your own skill level, especially as you’re learning, so ask a friend who plays trumpet to sit in and listen to you play. If there’s a band mate who seems to really excel at playing high notes, approach them and ask if they would consider working with you on your technique.


You may also want to consider hiring a professional trumpet instructor to take lessons, if you don’t already do so. These professionals offer essential advice and practice tips to help you improve every aspect of your trumpet playing ability including your range. Additionally, lessons help you stay accountable to investing time to practice every day.

Push your jaw forward to line up your lips.,
Leave about ¼” (6 mm) between your teeth.,
Keep your tongue low in your mouth.,
Press your lips together loosely.,
Set your lips lightly against the mouthpiece.,
Keep your lips moist.,
Adjust your embouchure for different notes.,
Maintain upright posture.,
Practice buzzing your lips everyday.,
Watch instructional videos.,
Ask an instructor for tips.",How to Develop Embouchure on Trumpet," Most people naturally have an overbite, which means their lips are not lined up on top of each other. Moving your jaw forward situates your bottom lip directly under your top lip. Be sure not to push your jaw too far forward. The right spot aligns your top and bottom teeth straight up and down.Practice moving your jaw forward and backward while you buzz your lips to hear how this affects the buzz. You can also feel how it directs the airflow either down to your chin or up to your nose.
Aligning your teeth directs the airflow straight forward into the mouthpiece for maximum airflow.;
, Do not clamp your teeth together as this will hinder the airflow. Your teeth should be at least ¼” (6 mm) and at most ½” (12 mm) apart. Your jaw should feel like it is hanging loosely.Get the feel for this placement by putting the narrow end of the mouthpiece between your teeth. You can also use a pen or pencil, or a straw, which can help you test your airflow.

, Proper embouchure allows just the right amount of air to pass through your lips. If your tongue is on the roof of your mouth or moving around your mouth, it will block the airflow.Your tongue will move and tap your lips as you play the notes, but when you aren’t tonguing notes, it should rest low in your mouth.

, The buzz you need to make only happens if your lips are touching. Lips that are too loose will let the air pass through without making a buzz sound. If your lips are pressed too tightly air can’t escape at all. Keep the corners of your mouth wide and firm.To learn the right tightness of the lips, practice making them too tight and too loose. You’ll learn to feel what the balanced middle point is.
Buzz your lips when they are tight and when they are loose and listen to the difference in sound.

, To buzz your lips properly, they need to be fully against the rim of the mouthpiece. Do not press them too tightly against the mouthpiece as this will stop them from buzzing. Align the center of your lips with the center of the mouthpiece.


Practice this with the mouthpiece and without the horn. Press your lips firmly against the mouthpiece and notice how you can’t buzz your lips. Pull your lips away so they barely touch and notice how the buzz doesn’t transfer through the mouthpiece.
Using this practice technique will help you find the right amount of pressure to produce a buzz.

, Wet lips help your lips buzz while you play. Find the balance between too dry and too wet. Learn the right moistness that creates sound but doesn’t cause your lips to slip off of the mouthpiece.Dry lips will keep you from making a full buzz sound. Overly wet lips will cause your mouth to slip off of the mouthpiece.

, The buttons and valves on the trumpet have the largest impact on changing notes, but your embouchure is important too. Tighten your embouchure when playing high notes and loosen it when playing low notes.Without your mouthpiece or trumpet, practice tightening and loosening your embouchure and notice how the pitch of the buzz changes. This effect is amplified when blown through the horn.
Next, practice with just the mouthpiece and notice the siren-like sound you can make by changing the embouchure shape.

, Your embouchure is not effective when you don’t have enough air. Sitting up straight keeps your airways open so that you can blow with enough force to produce the full scale of notes. Good posture also keeps your trumpet raised.Slump down in your chair and notice how you can’t breathe as deeply as when you are sitting upright. Practice good posture when you aren’t playing so you get used to sitting up straight.

, Your lips will get tired easily when you are first learning your embouchure. Practice holding it for a few minutes. Then practice buzzing for a few minutes. Add a little bit of time each day so you can build up your endurance.


Since many musical pieces are five to ten minutes or longer, it’s important that you can buzz your lips for a long time without getting tired.

, If you are having trouble with a particular part of the embouchure, look for videos that describe that part or the whole process. Watching someone form the embouchure may give you a better idea than reading about it. Ask a teacher or mentor if they have any videos you could borrow, or search online for videos.


You’ll also be able to see the way players hold the trumpet and sit.

, If you are in a band class at school, or take lessons with a mentor, ask them to look at your embouchure or listen as you play to see what you are doing wrong. They will be able to help you with specific problems you are facing with your embouchure.


If you don’t have anyone to ask, find a local instructor who would be willing to help you out. You may be able to get some quick tips without taking a full, paid lesson.

Start every practice session with 10-15 minutes of scales.,
Practice with consistent rhythm and speed, avoiding mistakes.,
Skip strings as you play to build speed up and down the neck.,
Play with triplets and quarter-note sets.,
Try ""down and backs"" to learn to change direction quickly.,
Skip notes, but make sure you only play notes in the scale.,
Improvise solos in your favorite scales.",How to Practice Guitar Scales1," Scales are an incredible way to warm up, and they are essential to becoming a good guitarist. You need to make scales a priority in your practice time, so put aside a set amount of time to practice them each day. Turn on a timer and work through every scale you know, playing them each on multiple sections of the guitar.Baseball players hit batting practice every day on a variety of pitches, artists doodle in a sketchbook, and writers free-write. Scales are the basic skill behind guitar theory and playing, and you need to devote time to practicing them.;
, Do not rush through your scales, hitting 1-2 bum notes or missing a string here and there, just because you want to get faster. Speed means nothing if you're not hitting notes cleanly, so always practice with an ear for perfection. Once you've got the scales and exercises down at a certain tempo, then you can gradually increase your speed. It may be frustrating now, but it will make you a better guitarist in the long run.It is highly recommended that you play with a metronome for the best practice sessions.

, Once you have the scales memorized up and down, it's time to kick your practice into the next level. Very rarely do you play a scale straight up and down, so you shouldn't always practice like that. Try the following string skipping exercises to master any scale.


Play all the normal notes on your scale. Start with the 6th string (your thickest string), then skip to the 4th. Play the notes on the 4th string, then come back up to the 5th. Skip to the 3rd string, then come back to the 4th, moving up and down like this until you can hit them all in rhythm
Skip from top to bottom, playing the 6th string, then the 1st. Then play the 5th string, followed by the 2nd, etc.
After each string, return to the 6th string again so that you repeat the root note after every string. Once you've gone up and down like this, start repeating the 5th string, then the 4th, etc., This is a fantastic way to increase your speed both up and down the neck, and to add a bit of spice to your normal scale runs. Basically, you play the first note in a scale, then the next three in quick succession. You then return to the 2nd note in the scale and play the next three in quick succession. From there, you repeat the pattern all the way down, until you've done a set starting with every note in the scale.


Try to string this together rhythmically -- not worrying about speed just yet.
While you'd never play a full solo like this, you can adapt parts of this lick into your playing once you get better., This simple little exercise is a great way to comfortable speeding up and down the fretboard during solos. To do it, simply play your scale like normal. However, once you hit the fifth note, turn around and re-play the last three notes you played. Work through the whole scale like this -- five notes down, three notes up, and then reverse it once you hit the bottom.


As you get comfortable, adjust the numbers. Try going four down, two up. How small can you make the intervals and still move comfortably through the scale?
For an added challenge, try it with repeating notes. Once you get to the fifth note, play it twice, then move only two notes back. Repeat this note as well. This is a good way to work on your picking speed., Start playing your scales randomly, to the rhythm. Set a metronome to a comfortable pace, then hit a note on every single beat. Pick notes at random, but make sure they are all on the scale.


As you get better, move up and down the neck. How many unique notes can you play before messing up? This is invaluable practice for improvisation because it teaches you to find the right note anywhere on the guitar at the drop of a hat., Not all practice has to be rote. Once you've worked through the technical exercises, bring it all together by improvising a few solos with your scales. You can search for practice tracks online by typing ""Key + Your Scale + Instrumental Track,"" Such as ""A Minor Dorian Scale Instrumental."" You can also train your ear by putting on your favorite songs, then finding the key and scale by yourself. Ultimately, all the scale practice in the world means nothing if you can't use them in a song, so have some fun and start jamming.


Though jams are more free-form, you should still be focusing on technique. Challenge yourself, but don't sacrifice quality of play for a few faster, sloppier notes.

Learn the major scale, minor scale, and pentatonic scale when you first start playing.,
Memorize the scale by playing it up and down slowly.,
Slowly pick up speed by practicing with a metronome.,
Learn the scale across the guitar, not just in one place.,
Expand your scales across the neck once you have the basics memorized.,
Look up new scales once you have the basics down.",How to Practice Guitar Scales2," These three scales are, far and away, the most useful scales you can learn, and they are the easiest. Almost every other scale is some variation on these three scales, and the pentatonic scale -- the most common rock and blues guitar scale -- is itself just a variation on the minor scale. The following diagrams in the key of A, and are written in guitar tab. This means that the number represents the fret you need to play, and the line represents each string.



Minor Pentatonic Scale: If you're playing modern music, the pentatonic scale will almost always suffice. If you want to start soloing quickly, this is the one to get down.

e|---------------------5-8-------------|
|B|-----------------5-8-----------------
G|-------------5-7---------------------|
D|---------5-7-------------------------|
A|-----5-7-----------------------------|
E|-5-8---------------------------------|Major Scale: This is the basis of all major chords. It is bright and happy, and absolutely essential to know for music theory, but it is usually adapted when used in solos or leads:

e|---------------------------4-5-|
B|-----------------------5-7-----|
G|-----------------4-6-7---------|
D|-----------4-6-7---------------|
A|-----4-5-7---------------------|
E|-5-7---------------------------|



Minor Scale: The basis for all minor chords, it has a darker, sadder feel. Like the major scale, most players adapt it for solos, but it is still essential for a guitarist to know:

e|-----------------------------5-7-8-|
B|-----------------------5-6-8-------|
G|-----------------4-5-7-------------|
D|-------------5-7-------------------|
A|-------5-7-8-----------------------|
E|-5-7-8-----------------------------, Start off with the basic pentatonic scale. Play each one at the pace where you can play all the notes without mistakes, and slowly speed up the pace once you get better. Always play the scale backward after playing it forwards. Don't try and create any variations now, just get used to playing all the notes, in order, front to back.


You want to play slowly enough that you don't make mistakes. You don't want to reinforce bad habits when you first start learning.

, To really crush your scales, you need to be able to play them to a beat. A simple metronome is a great way to keep you on time and to measure your progress. Do not, however, speed the machine up until you can comfortably play the scale up and down without mistakes.


You can get free metronome apps on your phone, or find them online.
Remember -- practicing scales is about technique. It may feel boring now, but you'll notice the benefits once you start using the scales for solos and licks.

, Almost all the scales that you learn are actually ""scale forms."" This means that, without any extra movement, you can move them up and down the neck to put the scale in a new key. For example, the most common pentatonic scale to learn is A-Minor, where you start on the third fret. But, if the song is in E-Minor, all you have to do is make the first note an E, then play the same basic structure.


Learning the notes of the guitar is essential to becoming a great soloist.
Play the scales across the neck, not just in the same place.
For guidance, check out this tab of every single major scale along with the corresponding key., Whenever you watch great guitarists, you'll notice that they rarely stay in the same place on the guitar the entire time they solo. They move up and down, and while it seems to be at random, they know exactly where to go. This is because they understand the ""intervals,"" which are the distances between two notes. While one could delve into interval theory for months, one basic pattern will help you expand your scale on every string across the whole neck:



Step Theory: Starting on your root note (the A in an A-Minor), you could play the whole scale on one string. Simply remember W-H-W-W-H-W-W. This is the distance between notes: W stands for whole-step (2 frets) and H stands for half-step (1 fret).

Try playing the whole minor scale on one string like this. Every note you play on this string could be used in a solo.


As you get better, test out new notes to the left and right of your scale. Can you play a whole ""solo"" without touching your normal scale?, Scales can be found on websites such as All Guitar Chords, or Guitar Scales. You should remember, however, that it is better to master 2-3 scales then to know 30 scales in pieces. Before moving on, make sure you can play the three basics scales outlined above across the entire guitar. It not only helps you play over almost anything, it will make learning new scales easier.Modes are variations, adding and subtracting notes, on the major and minor scale. They follow a series of rules that makes them coherent and pleasing to the ear.
To learn how to figure our modes by yourself, check out Wikihow's Learn Guitar Scales.

Cushioned stools made specifically for guitar playing are common at guitar shops, which you might peruse if you're interested, but regular kitchen chairs are appropriate as well.


Try not to use a chair that has arms, because it will give you very little space for your guitar, and can force you to hold the guitar awkwardly, leading to bad habits. Don't sit on the couch, a beanbag, or anything that'll suck you down into it. Posture is important for proper fundamentals.;
, If you're right handed, hold the guitar so your right hand falls about halfway between the sound hole and the bridge of the guitar, and support the neck of the guitar with your left hand.


With the guitar tight in to your body, orient the guitar so the the smallest string is pointed toward the ground and the thickest string toward the ceiling. Hold the back of the guitar so it touches your stomach and chest and rests on the leg of your strumming/picking hand. The neck should be aimed up, at about a 45 degree angle.
With your left hand, hold the neck in the V created by your thumb and forefinger. You should be able to smoothly move your left hand up and down the neck without having to hold it up, letting your leg and your right elbow cradle the guitar comfortably. If you're having to use your left hand to support the guitar up, you're holding the guitar incorrectly.

, Start every practice session by tuning your guitar. Playing an out-of-tune guitar can make practice sessions frustrating and counterproductive, making it important that you learn how to tune your guitar yourself as soon as possible. The ability to get your guitar in tune quickly will make practicing a lot smoother and more fun.



To tune with an electric tuner, hold the tuner close to the sound hole of an acoustic guitar, or plug an electric guitar directly into the tuner with quarter-inch cable. The tuner will indicate whether or not each string is flat (too low) or sharp (too high), and you can turn the corresponding tuning peg until the tone is correct. On many electric tuners, the light will turn green when the tone is correct.

To tune the guitar to itself, hold the low E string at the fifth fret to play an A, which should match to the 5th string. Tune the A string until the tones match, then hold the A string at the fifth fret and do the same thing with the D string. The only variation is the G string, which you'll hold at the 4th fret to match to the B string. This might not get you in perfect pitch, but it's fine for practice, as long as the guitar is tuned relative to itself.

Free online tuners, are also available to produce the proper tones and match them. Visit a free online tuner by clicking here here.

, The pick, also called the plectrum, can be a source of frustration for beginning players. To make sure you build the right skills and comfortability with your instrument, you need to practice holding the pick correctly.


To hold the pick correctly, turn your picking hand (your dominant, or writing hand) with your palm parallel to your stomach. Curl all your fingers in toward your palm and place the pick with the skinny point facing directly at you on top of your pointer finger. Hold it in place with your thumb.
There should be no more than about two centimeters of pick sticking out of your hand. Holding the pick at the end will result in lots of drops and bad habits. To learn to pick and strum correctly, hold the pick with very little sticking out.

, Practice forming chords properly and playing clean chords, without striking any dead strings. Practice chords until each note rings out evenly, no louder or quieter than any other note in the chord. Practice switching between chords to make your transitions as smooth and as fluid as possible.


Start by forming first-position chords. First-position chords are played between the first and third fret, generally incorporating a lot of open strings. You can play most pop, country, and rock songs on a few basic first-position chords.
Common first-position chords for beginners to learn include the G chord, D chord, Am chord, C chord, E chord, A chord, and F chord.

, Barre chords, also called power chords, are all made from the same finger-positioning at different frets on the guitar. You can form a G chord in first position, or by forming a barre chord at the third fret, for example. They tend to be somewhat difficult for the beginner, because they require a wide fingering, but are great for playing rock and punk songs.

, One of the most commonly overlooked and essential things to becoming a good guitar player is to play in time. It's great if you can play the solo from ""Black Dog"" at a million miles an hour, but can you play it slowly, with feeling? Practicing to a beat forces you to play the notes you see, not the notes you can play. Developing a sense of rhythm in your playing will make you a better guitar player.

, If you're taking lessons, you'll likely be provided with scale sheets, while if you're learning from a book it'll be up to you to find the scales and practice them yourself. Mel Bay books and other resources have been teaching guitar players to pick for decades, while online sheet music and exercises are also available.


The pentatonic scale is a common rock key for guitar players to learn. Made up of five notes in each scale, the pentatonic scale, also often called ""the blues scale"" is the basis for many different types of music. Practice it in each key.
Learning different scales and modes is a great way of improving your playing, allowing you to maneuver around the guitar, but it's not the most fun exercise. Take a scale and attempt to turn it into a guitar solo. To make scales more fun, try to make them swing, playing them at different tempos, once you've got the basics down.

, Pick a few songs that you'd like to learn and start picking out the different parts, with the aid of sheet music, tablature, or listening by ear. try to learn songs all the way through, not just a single lick or chord progression. Practice chaining together the different parts of a song to get all the way through, and you'll be teaching yourself about composition and learn to play with stamina. It's harder than it looks.



For the beginner, folk and country songs are often the easiest to learn. Try to play the chords to ""Folsom Prison Blues"" by Johnny Cash, which is a fun and easy place to start. Other popular beginner songs that are good to practice include ""Tom Dooley,"" ""Long Black Veil,"" or even ""Mary Had a Little Lamb."" Pick a simple children's song to learn. It's likely it won't involve more than three chords: G, C, and D major.

For the intermediate player, start picking songs that introduce uncommon chords or unusual rhythm playing to learn more complex styles. Try learning songs that are outside of your listening range, to force yourself into unexplored regions. If you like classical, try learning ""Lithium"" by Nirvana, for it's surprisingly complex chord voicing and melodic structure. Rock players might try to learn ""Fur Elise"" by Beethoven, to learn a new style. All players should learn to play all of ""Stairway to Heaven,"" so you can say you've arrived as a guitar player.

For the advanced player, choose compositionally difficult material that with force you to learn new techniques in your desired genre of music. Metal players should master the complex harmonics of Opeth leads, while country players should study Merle Travis's patented picking style, and rock players could spend a lifetime dissecting Jerry Garcia's psychedelic explorations.

, Strike a deal with yourself: learn a new song, or riff, for every new scale you tackle, or page of your practice book you pass during lessons. It's also a good idea to talk to your teacher, if you have one, about songs that you'd like to learn, so you don't spend all your time mastering Nirvana songs you don't have any interest in learning. Most guitar teachers are happy to teach you what you want to learn.

, Many of the greatest guitar players learned to play by listening repeatedly to the same song over and over again, their ear to the radio, slowly picking out the different parts on their own. Learning to play by ear is an equally-effective and important way of learning to play guitar. Listen to your favorite tunes until you can pick up the tricks and techniques the guitar players are using.

, To build up your guitar playing stamina and to retain the muscle memory that you're working to build, you need to practice somewhere in the neighborhood of 30 minutes a day.


As you become more proficient and build callouses on your fingers that'll make playing more comfortable, you'll be able to practice more in a day, but in the beginning it's good to aim for a happy medium. 30 minutes is long enough to improve and work on a considerable amount of material, but not so long as to wear you out.

, Because building callouses and dexterity is such an important part of playing guitar, it's very important to practice consistently, several times a week, or you'll end up back at square one every time you pick up the instrument.


Try setting a practice time each day, maybe right after you get done with work or school, or right after dinner. Start making it a habit to pick up the guitar at that same time every day and putting in your 30 or 40 minutes.
If you rarely practice guitar, that will lead to pain in the finger tips all over again. It will be so much easier to play guitar if you practice a lot because of no pain in your finger tips and because you will be used to playing and reading notes and tablature.

, Each time you pick up the guitar, sit in your practice chair, holding the guitar and the pick correctly, and do some exercises for at least 3 or 5 minutes to get your fingers warmed up for your session. Picking even quarter-notes on each of the first four frets of each string, from low E to high E is a common warm-up exercise.


Common warm up exercises usually involve picking a particular pattern up and down the neck of the guitar, not necessarily the most tuneful pattern, but one that'll get your fingers loose. You can develop your own or learn one from a guitar teacher you like.
Anything repetitive can be appropriate for a warm-up. Running up and down a new scale you're learning, or playing your favorite Clapton lick. Whatever you like to play, play it up and down a few times until your fingers feel loose and comfortable. Then you're ready for practice.

, In each practice session, it's important to give equal weight to the things you want to do and the things you have to do. Want to practice the ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" solo? Go for it, but make yourself earn it by running through your scale sheet first. Weight the latter half of each practice session with fun activities to give yourself something to look forward to.

, It's possible to reach plateaus in your guitar-playing ability and start to level off. In fact, many guitar players aren't much better after five years of playing than after the first five months, because of these plateaus. To practice effectively, you need to learn to embrace the challenge of learning a new song, mastering a new style, or adding complexity to the skills you've already learned, so you can avoid the flat-line.Nailed the solo from ""Black Dog"" by Zeppelin? Write a new one in mixolydian mode, or try to play it backwards. Play the whole solo without ever playing the root note. Give yourself little challenges to force yourself to improvise and improve.

, It's very difficult to learn an instrument completely on your own. While it's not necessarily critical to pay for private lessons, there's no substitute from playing with other people and learning things first hand. It's an excellent way to practice.


Look for open jam sessions in your town, at which you can hang out and learn the tricks of the trade from more experienced players. You might even get a band out of it.
Embrace YouTube tutorials. Learning to play guitar has never been easier, since we've got the ability to see close-up footage of long-dead greats like Mississippi John Hurt, or Rev. Gary Davis picking their compositions close up. Where guitar players once had to listen, not you can see where the fingers of the great ones went, and learn from their styles.

, One of the toughest parts of practice and learning to stick with the guitar is the finger pain in your fretting hand. Pushing on the steel or nylon strings is painful at first, no doubt about it, and it'll take a while of negotiating that pain before you build up callouses that'll make it more comfortable.


Practice more, but for shorter sessions, if the pain is too strong. If you find yourself unable to play for 30 or 40 minutes without uncomfortable finger pain, take a break until your fingers feel better. Shake your wrist and move it around to increase the blood flow and give your finger tips a break., You can make sure you're not pushing the strings too hard, causing unnecessary pain, by finding the string's ""buzz point."" Push on a string like you normally do, then gradually let up on the string as you pick it. Find the point at which the string starts playing dead, or buzzing, because you're not pushing it hard enough. The best pressure to use is just past the buzz point, light enough to be comfortable, but hard enough to avoid the buzz., No, guitar playing may not be a sport, but stretching out your arms and your back quickly before and after your practice sessions can make you a lot more comfortable.



To stretch your hands, wiggle your fingers, waving your fingers like seaweed fluttering in the water. It's also a good idea to do some quick finger push-ups, pressing into the top of a desk or table with your fingertips, then letting your hand fall and push it back up.

To stretch your arms and shoulders, wrap each arm around your chest, one at a time, as if you were giving yourself a hug. With the other arm, pull gently but firmly on your elbow to loosen the muscles in your arms and shoulders. Do this with each arm for a slow count of 15.

To stretch out your back, reach your arms up toward the sky as high as you can for a count of 15, then hold a push-up position, as straight as possible, for another 15. You're ready to practice.

, Holding your breath is especially common when you start playing on stage, or performing in front of a teacher or other listener. It can even happen when you practice, creating tightness in your upper chest and giving you a tendency to play irregularly and rush through your phrases. Practice with as light a grip on your instrument as possible, and breathe comfortably and deeply, especially when you're concentrating.


If and when you notice yourself holding your breath, stop for a second and reposition yourself. Make sure you're sitting upright and take a few deep breaths before continuing. Especially if you're getting frustrated trying to practice a particular song or scale, give yourself a breath. It can make a big difference.

, Whether you're trying out your first jazz chords, switching from an electric to a classical acoustic guitar, or trying to speed up your finger exercises, it's important to start slow, learn the part correctly, and allow yourself the time to acclimate to the new way of playing.


Since guitars have all different variety of neck sizes, string sizes, and fret gaps, it's important to alter your practice sessions with a new instrument slightly. It might not be possible for you to play particular songs or scales as quickly as you once did. Give yourself the time to acclimate to the new instrument, and give your fingers a chance to stretch in the new ways. You've got to retrain your muscle memory, if the frets are just a little different., A popular guitar players adage goes, ""Those who can't play well play fast. Those who can't play fast play loud."" Point being, don't develop a bad habit of rushing through each lick to prove how fast you can shred. The best guitar players aren't the fastest guitar players, they're the once who play correctly. Learn to practice in time, then speed up to increase your dexterity when you've got it down.

Decide on a budget.,
Understand what to look for when picking out the beginner trumpet.,
Check the slides and valves.,
Get a feel for the trumpet.,
Ask about a warranty on the trumpets you are considering.,
Check for leaks, dents or corrosion.,
Choose a mouthpiece.,
Check the horn's compression.",How to Buy a Beginner Trumpet,"


New beginner trumpets (sometimes also called student trumpets) can retail for $700 or more. If you are on a tight budget, consider purchasing a used horn. Many music stores offer used trumpets and can assist you in choosing the right fit for your or your child. Trumpets are often available through private sellers, but when you buy a used horn from a music store, all the repairs to the trumpet's valves, pads and slides will usually have been done before the horn was put up for sale.;
,


There is a big difference between beginner, intermediate and professional trumpets. While beginner trumpets play well, they are of lesser craftsmanship and have fewer features than intermediate or professional horns. Many student trumpets have a two-piece rather than a one-piece bell, which does affect sound quality. Be sure to specify that you want a beginner trumpet.

,


The valves and slides on a beginner trumpet should have a looser tolerance than intermediate and pro models. Be sure the parts of the beginner trumpet you are considering move freely. Push the valves down quickly and be sure they spring back up quickly and easily.

,


Although it may be convenient and sometimes even less expensive to buy your trumpet online, it is best to go to a shop where you can actually look at and handle the horns. Different brands of trumpets have slightly different weights, so they will each feel different in your hands. Try out several before you make your decision.

,


Whether the trumpet you decide to buy is new or used, inquire about a warranty. Make sure the terms are spelled out clearly. It should include a time frame for returns or exchanges. It should also outline exactly what repairs will be made to the trumpet and for what period of time before charges would be incurred.

,


If there are pink or red spots on the horn, this is a sign of internal corrosion. New horns should not have any dents or scratches; dents or dings can affect not only the operation of the horn, but also the sound. Feel the felts on the valves and the corks on the water keys to make sure they are present, that they look to be in good condition and do not need to be replaced.

,


A C-cup mouthpiece, which has a small rim, is the typical choice for a beginner. As you or your child become more skilled, you may consider moving up to a 5C or 1C mouthpiece.

,


Be sure all the trumpet's valves and slides are in place, then push down and release all the valves. Then pull out the slides one at a time and listen for a pronounced pop. If you don't hear one, the horn has an air leak and thus shouldn't be the one you buy.

Tuning: There are several models of Strumsticks on the market, but we'll just focus on the two most popular; the Basic and Grand Strumstick.,
Strumming: Always use the neck strap and adjust it so the Strumstick is hanging close to your chest.,
Now, try strumming up on all three strings.,
Take as much time as you need, then try strumming on the down and upstroke.,
Now, it's time to play some notes.,
Move your finger to another fret, and strum again.,
Try sliding you finger to another fret while strumming.,
Playing songs: The frets are numbered, starting with the first fret as #1.",How to Play the Strumstick," The Basic is tuned to G, D, G. The Grand to D, A, D. Now, don't worry if you don't know how to read music. The best way is to buy a cheap electric tuner. The tuner will hear what key a single string is tuned to, and will have a read-out of where you are on the scale. It's just a matter of plucking the top string, and loosening or tightening the string to get the right key. In the case of the Basic strumstick, that would be G. Now, pluck the middle string, and tune it to the key of D, and so on to the bottom string, to the key of G again. There is a way to tune your Strumstick manually; which I will provide a link too at the end of this article.;
, Take a guitar pick, and just strum down all three strings. Wow! Sounds good. Just keep strumming down on the strings for awhile, and just get a feel for it.

, Take your time, and really feel how you become more loose and comfortable with each stroke.

, Now you're strumming. Don't worry about your other hand yet. Just strum.

, Place your index or middle finger, whichever one is the most comfortable for you, on the bottom string. This will also be the thinnest string. Press your finger in between two frets, and now strum. Make sure you're only pressing on the bottom string. Listen to how different it sounds, than when you were strumming without holding down the string.

, It sounds different again. Hey! You're starting to play notes. Keep strumming and move your finger to other frets, and listen to how it all sounds good. There are no wrong notes!

, Just keep playing until you're comfortable with strumming. If you become frustrated, just go back to practicing strumming without using your other hand.

, The sheet music for the Strumstick has this in mind. It will have a number that corresponds with what fret your finger should be on. I will provide a link too some songs. You can also purchase music books for the Mountain Dulcimer, as long as the songs are in the same key.

Relax your wrist, gripping the neck of the guitar in the ""C"" formed between thumb and fingers.,
Curl your fingers whenever you're playing a note.,
Keep your fingers close to the fretboard to improve speed and precision.,
Use your thumb pushing on the back of the neck to provide power and stability.,
Roll or rotate your wrist to help get up and down the fretboard.",How to Position Your Fingers on Guitar Strings1," Your wrist should feel relaxed and free to move. Many guitarists angle their fingers slightly towards their body, instead of trying to hold their wrist at a rigid 90-degree angle. All of your fingers should be able to easily hit a fret on every string.









If your hands are too small for this reach at first, that is okay. They make smaller guitars for smaller hands, but you'll also learn to pivot your wrist to make all the frets accessible.;
, You want to be able to press down on a fret with your fingertips. So set yourself up so you can effectively bend your fingers to keep unplayed strings exposed. You want your fingertip on the string, leaving the rest of your finger curling away from the strings. This is essential for effective chords, as well as a lot of lead playing.

, While inadvertent, many beginners let their fingers relax away from the neck when they aren't using them. But watch a professional guitarist and you see that their fingers, even ones they aren't using, are always nice and close to the strings, ready to fret. This is a habit worth training early on.








, You don't want to be clamping down too hard on the neck, but you also don't want to leave it loose. A firm grip allowing you to ""pinch"" the strings down on the neck will help you hold notes, chords, and manipulate the strings for bends and slides.








, As you play, your thumb will be sliding up and down, almost hooking over the top of the neck when you're on the low strings and sliding down as you reach up for the top strings. If your keep your wrist relaxed and mobile you'll find finger positioning much, much easier.







"
"
Angle your fingertips in towards the fret to position precisely.,
Always position your finger as close to the fret as possible.,
Use your non-fretting fingers to dampen or mute unused strings.,
Experiment with different heights for your barring fingers.,
Practice shifting back and forth between two chords to practice quick positioning.",How to Position Your Fingers on Guitar Strings2," The hard little part of your fingertip, just to the sides of the nail, is a small, precise location to fret with. The fleshy part of your finger will work, but it will be harder to get a clean note and it is much easier to accidentally mute other strings. Angle your hand and fingers slightly so this hard part of your fingertips is hitting the strings.








, If you're playing a note on the 3rd fret, get your finger as close to the 3rd fret as you possibly can. This allows the cleanest, sharpest tone. You don't want to be on the actual fret, just right behind it.









Remember, if you're playing the 3rd fret you want to be between the 2nd and 3rd frets, you finger as close to the 3rd as possible.

, This is a slightly more advanced technique, but is a key way to position your fingers. You can minimize mistakes by letting unused fingers rest lightly on the strings, which prevents them from sounding out if they accidentally get picked. Frequently this involves lightly draping your index finger behind the frets you're using.

, When playing a barre chord, when one finger covers multiple strings and frets, is often the bane of new players. If some of the notes in your bar won't stay down, and always buzz when played, adjust how high you set your finger. Most people start with the tip of their finger on the top string of the barre. But this doesn't always work. Place your bar so that your finger joints don't leave any strings exposed.








, If there is a chord you struggle to fret with speed, work on shifting to it from a chord you are already comfortable with. Slowly, waiting until you can comfortably play each chord with no bum notes, strum along and switch back and forth between the two chords to build up finger strength, speed, and precision.

",How to Play the Guitar and Sing at the Same Time2,",,


Your brain uses alpha waves and beta waves (conscious/sub-conscious). You use alpha waves when you concentrate and focus on something and use beta waves when you can just ""do it"" without ""thinking about it"". Once you have the song down to this point, you're ready for the final step.

, Now sing the song and let the playing fall to the background. Your conscious will be concentrating on the singing, but your sub-conscious will be playing the song. This can feel a little like an out of body experience where half your brain is actually playing the guitar and the singer in you is using the other half. It's weird at first, but very exciting and fun once you got it down.


Finally, you will be able, with practice, to change roles back and forth (did I hit that chord right? yes, OK the next vocal line goes like...).
Note: it is quite rare for guitar solos and singing parts to occur at the same time (that is by design) don't try to change that when you go to write a song(easier on you anyway).

You will also need two long towels to lay the horn on, a wash cloth, and a polishing cloth to dry the horn with without scuffing the finish. Some dish soap, brushes, including a snake brush and pipe cleaner, will be used to clean your trumpet. Finally, you will need valve oil and slide grease to properly oil your trumpet when you reassemble it.You can usually find the oil and grease at an instrument or music store. If you aren't sure what type of grease and oil to buy, ask one of the workers what they would use for their instrument. You can also purchase kits online that are specifically created to clean trumpets and bass instruments.
If you don't have a polishing cloth, you can use a microfiber cloth or an old cotton t-shirt. If using a shirt, make sure it is one that has been washed a lot and doesn't have any text on it. You want to avoid scuffing your instrument at all cost. Never use a regular towel to dry off your instrument.;
,(Hold your valves when putting it back in) To wash your trumpet, you will want to disassemble it so you can effectively clean all areas of your instrument.Take apart all pieces of your instrument, but once you twist and unscrew the springs and felt pads that are inside the valves, set them aside. You will not clean these as they can get damaged if wet. Be careful not to dent any of the pieces as you take apart your trumpet.Make sure you keep track of how the pieces fit together as you take apart your trumpet.
If your valves get wet it can affect their shape and hinder the valves' performance. If the springs get wet it can lead to deterioration.
Sometimes if your valves are not properly oiled, they can get stuck in your trumpet. Removing these parts and the slides should not require much force, so if you are finding it difficult to take them apart, they may be stuck. Don't force them out as this can damage your trumpet. Take your trumpet to a professional so that they can dissemble your trumpet without damaging it., Fill up your bathtub about halfway with lukewarm water. As the water is filling the tub, squirt a few drops of dish soap into the water. Make sure you plug up the drain in the bath tub so the water doesn't run out.Using hot water can damage the trumpets finish, so make sure that the water is warm to touch. Cold water won't damage your trumpet necessarily, but it also won't give your trumpet the most effective soaking.If you don't have a tub, you can use a large bucket and fill it with water. Make sure the bucket is long and deep enough that you can lay your trumpet flat in the water.

, When you place your trumpet in the tub, you don't want it to dent on the hard surface. Placing a towel down will give it some padding and prevent it from getting banged up while you are cleaning it. Take one of your long towels and set it at the bottom of the tub, spreading it out so it fully covers the bottom of the tub., Once the tub is halfway full, stop the water flow. Then, set the trumpet and its parts down into the water on the towel.(If you wash you're valves it could ruin the felt) Space them out so that they don't bump up against each other in the water. Allow them to soak for 20 minutes or so, letting the dish soap effectively clean them.(The mouthpiece should be in hot water to clean better) , After your trumpet has soaked for some time you can begin to clean it out. Using your snake brush and pipe cleaners, clean out the insides of your slides. Run your brushes through the valve casings a few times. Spend some time cleaning out the area closest to the mouth piece. This area usually gets a lot of build up and bacteria, so you'll want to clean it out thoroughly., Leave your trumpet soaking in the water. Then, take a washcloth and dip it in the tub, getting it soaking wet. Then, gently rub the exterior of your trumpet with the washcloth, cleaning any dirt or dust off your trumpet. Make sure you don't brush roughly as this can create scuff marks., After you have thoroughly cleaned and scrubbed all of your pieces, unplug the drain in the tub. As the water begins to drain, turn the faucet back on and rinse out your pieces under lukewarm water. Place a towel down on the floor outside of the tub. After you have rinsed out a piece, place it on the towel., You want to avoid creating scuff marks on your trumpet at all cost, so make sure you are using a cloth that will not scratch your trumpet. Gently take the cloth and wipe down your instruments, removing the excess water. Then, set them back down on the towel and allow them to air dry the rest of the way.Air drying them will take longer, but it creates the least amount of risk of scuffing your instrument. You can place them in a sunny area for faster drying, or give it a few more hours if you want them to dry inside.
Make sure you have thoroughly dried out your valves. When the felt pads touch the valves, you do not want them to get wet as this will cause them to lose their shock-absorbing ability. Wipe down the inside and outside of the vales until completely dry, and then allow them to air dry even more., After your trumpet has dried completely, you can put it back together (it's okay if the mouthpiece is still a little wet as brass instruments are used to a little moisture). As you put your trumpet back together, grease the first and third slides and oil the valves modestly. Make sure you don't cake the oil and grease on as this can create build up and hinder the performance of your instrument. Put just enough that the slides and valves can effectively be put back together.
When you put the valve back into its casing, try not to rotate it as this can cause excessive wear. Carefully insert it into its casing until you hear a ""click."", Brass instruments dent easily and when they are dented it makes the instrument more difficult to play. Be careful with your instrument, placing it back in its case or on your lap when you can. Denting your instrument can cause valves or slides to stick. If this happens to your instrument, take it to a repair store so they can fix it professionally.

, This should be done every day or two. Remove the valves from their casing, paying attention to how they fit so you can properly insert them back in. Then, put three to five drops of oil on each valve. Gently place it back in its casing and repeat a few times a week, or when your valves are sticking., To keep excessive dirt and grime from building up on your trumpet, try to wipe it down daily with a polishing or microfiber cloth. Wipe down all sides of the instrument, especially the areas where you hold the trumpet. This will help keep the trumpet relatively clean between washes.Try to wash the cloth about once a month. Because it will soak up oils and grease from your instrument, it needs to be cleaned along with your trumpet. You don't want to use a dirty cloth, because it won't get the job done.

, While you want to consistently wipe down your instrument when using it, every month or so it will still need a good, deep cleaning. Give your trumpet a ""bath"" once a month, or once every other month depending on how often you use it. This will keep it in the best condition and allow the trumpet to perform at its best."

Get your guitar and your metronome and switch your head into practice mode.,
Start in 2nd position (1st finger 2nd fret) - most people know their notes better there - Each finger covers a fret, and a one fret stretch in either direction is allowed.,
Set the metronome at a comfortable tempo.

,Play scale of C major and extend it past the root note in both directions to encompass all notes in range of given position (you will get as low as F 1st fret low E string)

,
When you hit low F, come back up F major (1b) without losing time if you can help it.

,
The next scale will be Bb (we're moving round the cycle of fifths - if you don't know loads of info on the web on this).,
Continue in this way around the cycle - C,F,Bb,Eb,Ab,Db,Gb,B,E,A,D,G - in time.

Start your lick with a big, thumping root note by hitting the open 6th string.,
Slide into a triad on the bottom three strings.,
Strum this little triad six times, in total.,
Slide out of the triad into an open 3rd string G. Slide back towards the head, releasing your fingers as you hit the 2nd fret (as indicated in the tab by the ""4/2"") and strumming an open G string.,
End the first bar with a return to the root note.,
Walk your way through the final measure to turn the progression around.,
Put the whole thing together in a real song.",How to Play Turnaround Blues Licks1," The following lick is for blues in the key of E. So the open 6th string, an E, is a great note to anchor your turnaround. Starting with the root note of the song is perhaps the most common way to begin a turnaround lick.









A blues turnaround is only two measures, each with only one chord. In the key of E, your first chord of the turnaround is an E the second is a B. You then move back to E to restart the progression.;
, This mini-chord, known as a triad, has your ring finger on the 2rd string, 3rd fret, and 3rd string, 4th fret, with the bottom string left open. Start with your fingers on the 2nd and 3rd frets, respectively, and simultaneously strum and slid to the right frets. These little high-pitched triads are a key feature of many turnarounds.








, Have some fun here, funking it up with a loose, relaxed rhythm. It always helps to play along with an instrumental track, using YouTube or Google to find a ""E-blues jam track.""








, Don't worry too much about the slide-- you're doing it for a little accent, so you can slide it as far or short as you want for unique effect.








, This time, however, you can ""walk"" up to an octave of the root note by playing the 4th string, 2nd fret -- another E. After the slide up to the open G, ending here gives your measure a cool ""down and back"" feel to it.








, The V chord of the 12-bar blues is only played twice in the whole progression, and one of those key moments is the very end. Your lick needs to both get back to the B and set the song up to return to the E and the beginning of the progression. The easiest way to do that? A simple walk down the blues scale to your nearest B (in bold).









e|--------------------------------------|
B|--------------------------------------|
G|--------------------------------------|
D|--------------------------------------|
A|------0-1-2---------------------------|
E|-0-3---------------------------------|

, Practice the riff, on it's own, until you feel confident in your ability to play it. Then pull up a blues song in E and get ready to fit it into the turnaround. Many players have a cache of memorized turnaround licks in their head, since the moment is so short you need to think quickly to play it. Focus on getting to these notes in time, right where the belong in the progression, to become a real blues player.









Remember, these are the last two measures. Right before them are two more quick chord changes -- the last four measures in E are B-A-E-B.

Kick things off with a dark, moody E power chord.,
Use your index and middle finger to fret the 4th fret of the 1st and 3rd strings.,
Pick the 1st and 3rd strings with the pinky and ring finger of your strumming hand.,
Use your pinky to reach up and play the 6th fret of the 4th string, then hit the double notes again.,
Slide the whole form up to the 3rd fret, then repeat.,
Slide up again one fret, to the 2nd, then repeat.,
Pluck the high-E string, and the note on the 1st fret of the 3rd string, as the chords return to B.,
Walk down to the B note to turn the song around.,
Alternatively, turn to a big B7 chord to bring the song full circle.",How to Play Turnaround Blues Licks2," To play it, simply put your finger on the 2nd fret of the A string and strum the top two strings. Like in the previous lick, starting with the root note (an E for the key of E) is a powerful way to signal the turnaround. Playing the power chord is simply a stronger, louder version than the open E string used above.









Want a little more power? Add in the 4th string, 2nd fret as well. This note is an octave of E, and will make your sound much bigger, louder, and brasher.

, You'll have one string in between that is not fretted. More likely than not, you'll accidentally mute this string with another one when trying to avoid it -- this is a good thing! You won't need this unfretted string.








, This is called ""hybrid picking,"" where you use your fingers to quickly get across other notes. After picking the power chord, use your fingers to pluck the two notes you've fretted on the 4th fret.









You can also use your pick, if it is easier. But you will have to use your strumming hand to mute the middle string, draping your index finger lightly on the string to keep it from sounding out.

, This is the form of the whole lick -- you pluck the two lower strings, then hit the 4th string note two frets down. Reaching up with your pinky is not easy for beginners, but big-handed players might be able to reach up with their ring finger.








, Slide your index and middle finger up one fret to the 3rd fret. Pluck the two strings, then hit the 5th fret of the 4th string. Pluck the two strings one more time.








, Move up a fret, pluck the two strings on the 2nd fret, then hit the 4th fret note on the 4th string. Return to pluck the doubled strings again. This is the end of your first measure.









Practice this first measure to play it fluidly. How can you adjust the exact same notes (doubling some, omitting others, strumming differently) to get a completely different turnaround?

, As the chords circle back, slide your two fingered form over to the 1st fret, then remove your bottom finger. Pluck this like the other two-fingered note sets.








, This is almost identical to the earlier turnaround. Simply play the three notes on the A-string, the open string, the 1st fret, and finally the 2nd fret (which is a B) to get everything back to the beginning.









Sliding or bending into this final two is a slick, bluesy way to get around the scale.

, Using chords in soloing isn't easy, but you can use chord shapes to give you new notes worth playing. Take, for example, the following chord -- s B7 used in the E blues turnaround. A common, killer way to turn the song around is to pick the notes of the V chord individually, hinting at the chord while staying in ""solo"" mode. Strum through the following chord slowly for your last measure, hitting each note.

Learn jazz chords and fingerings.,
Learn to read music.,
Learn arpeggios and scales.,
Learn tunes.,
Go out, listen, and play.",How to Play Jazz Guitar Like the Greats," The chords for jazz guitar are much more complex than the open chords acoustic players use. For one, you probably won't use many open strings, and for another, you'll be playing different notes. At a minimum, start with 7 chords (minor, major, and dominant), augmented, and diminished chords (+ and -, respectively). Once you've got the basics down you can learn to add extensions.;
, Yes, there are plenty of guitarists who learned to play by ear, but if you can read you'll be at a huge advantage. Start with learning to read chord changes, because as a guitarist you'll be doing that more often, but don't be stumped when you're called on to play a melody. The best way to learn is with a method book (William Leavitt's Modern Method for Guitar is excellent).

, Most solos can be based on either the major or minor pentatonic or blues scales, but you should learn your arpeggios (which are even simpler than pentatonic scales) and your full major and minor scales. Work on the chromatic scale too- it might be easy to finger but learning to apply it is one of the skills that distinguishes the best from the rest.

, Jazz is one of those genres where there are certain songs everybody knows how to play, and you'll be expected to know them. Get yourself a copy of The Real Book from Hal Leonard. Volume One has plenty of standards to start with, and Volume Four has a lot of other older standards (there are other good books out there but Hal Leonard is the one that's on most bandstands, so you'll never get into a fight with the trumpets about the chords). The most important chord progressions are blues (Blue Monk and Straight No Chaser are good first tunes to learn) and rhythm changes (I've Got Rhythm is the original, and Oleo gets called almost every night at a jam somewhere).

, Don't step up to the bandstand the first time you attend a jam session. Listen to what's going on, but when you're ready, get up and play. You can't become a great player if you only ever play in the woodshed by yourself! As a corollary, don't spend too much time on the stand when you're up. Play one or two songs, and don't solo for too long- two or three choruses is appropriate for blues, one for something longer, and on a slow ballad, you might even limit yourself to half a chorus and let somebody else trade off with you. There are probably other players who want to play too, so don't overstay your welcome.

Use the 12-bar blues chord progression as the backing of any blues song.,
Alternate a big downstroke and a quick upstroke when strumming for a ""shuffle"" feel.,
Play an open E, the I chord, for four measures.,
Play open A (the IV chord) for two measures, return to then E for two measures.,
Play B-A-E-B, each for one measure to end the progression.,
Repeat ad nauseum.,
Substitute 7 chords for a bluesy feel.",How to Play the Blues on Guitar1," This form is simply a guide for when to play certain chords. Each bar (or count of ""1,2,3,4, 1,2,3,4, 1..."") is assigned a chord, and together they form the melodic backbone of 95% of blues songs. To make it, you simply take the first (I), fourth (IV), and fifth (V) chords of the major scale and make them into chords. Once you know the form in one key, like ""E,"" you can then easily transpose the song into any key you want. For the key of E, your chords are E, A, and B.









While the following article uses easy to form power chords, you can also uses seventh chords, minor chords, or minor sevenths.

Before beginning, make sure you review the major and minor scales for guitar.

The blues are in simple 4/4 time, like almost all radio songs. If this is a struggle, review rhythm and time signatures.
;
, Use a ""swung"", chugging rhythm to give the song a blues feel — your strums should sound like ""dun da-dun da-dun da-dun..."" It can help to listen to early blues recordings like Robert Johnson's ""I Believe I'll Dust My Broom"" to get this rhythm down.br>









If you count out, like ""1 and, 2 and, etc,"" think of a big strum down on the number, then a quick upstroke for ""and.""
If this is difficult at first, start with a strumming pattern that works for you until you get the progression down.

, The first chord you play is going to be the key of the song. So, if you start with an E, your songs will be a twelve bar blues in the key of E. You'll hold this E for four full bars.









It always helps to practice with a metronome to ensure you play each measure the correct number of times.

, Next, in a 12-bar blues, you play the fourth of the starting chord for two measures before returning to the starting chord. Since A is three notes above an E in the major scale, it's the IV chord in the key of E.








, The last four bars of a 12-bar blues are called ""the turnaround."" In the turnaround, you play the fifth, the fourth, the starting chord, and then repeat the fifth one more time. B is the fifth of E since it is one note above A, the fourth, so we play B, then A, then E, then B again.








, That's all there is to a basic 12-bar blues — just play E-E-E-E-A-A-E-E-B-A-E-B until the song's over (note that, when they're performed live, most 12-bars have a special ending that will vary from song to song.) To get the full 12-bar experience, try getting a friend who's more experienced at guitar to solo over your chords — with a little practice, you should soon get the hang of this simple but important blues progression.









To play in a different key, simply pick a different starting chord and shift the fourth and fifth accordingly. For instance, if you want to play in the key of C, you'll use C as your starting chord, F for the fourth, and G for the fifth. You can find a good guide for playing the 12-bar in different keys here.
Looking to spice up your progression? Check out Wikihow's ways to spice up your riff.


, Real blues musicians often use a special kind of chord called a ""7"" chord (or a ""dominant 7th chord"") to make the song sound a little ""bluesier."" These chords are the same as major chords, but with one note different. For a quick rundown of how to finger the most common 7 chords, click here.









You have two options when you substitute 7 chords into a 12-bar blues: you can either change the fifth to a 7 chord (for instance, in the key of A, E would become E7), or you can change every chord to a 7 chord (in the key of A, A would become A7, D would become D7, and E would become E7.) Different options sound better for different songs, so try experimenting to find the chords you like."

If you don't know it, then it can't hurt to review, but the rest of the article will continue as if you've never played it before.









The following scale is for the E-minor blues, meaning it will fit the chord progression played earlier.

, The beauty of playing in E is that you can use all of the open notes as part of your scale, meaning you don't have to fret six of the notes in the scale. This can make hammer-ons, pull-offs, and quick multi-string playing a lot of fun with a lot less effort.








, These are the first two notes of your scale. Play the root note, here the E on the open sixth string, then move down three frets. Most people play this second note with their ring finger or pinky.


Remember that the pentatonic scale is a ""shape."" You can move this to start on any note on the 6th string. The first note of the scale will be the song's key.

, These three notes are where the blues scale differs from the pentatonic, which ignores the first fret. This note, however, is the ""flat fifth"" in music theory that makes a song sound bluesy. You will play three notes total on the A string.


The flat fifth is an accent -- it is best played quickly, not lingered on.

, Note how a box-like pattern is forming. The open strings form a constant ""line"" of notes in the scale, while your ring finger frets a box either 2-3 frets down. Here, you simply play the open string and the second fret.

, This third fret is actually a reoccurring flat fifth -- it is the octave of the note you played earlier. Theory aside, this means the 3rd fret, usually played with your pinky, is another bluesy accent note.

, The last two strings are identical to the first string. Simply create this little box between the open string and the third frets on both the high-E and B strings.

, You can play the exact same scale starting from a different E. Simply move the whole form down to the 12th fret, since the 6th string 12th fret note is another E. Now, instead of playing open notes, you simply fret every string on the 12th fret when you get to it. Everything else stays in place.


Now that you know the scale, practice getting up and down it as smoothly and quickly as possible, in multiple locations across the fret board.

Imitate the reggae masters.",How to Play Reggae Guitar," For most guitarists, the easiest way to do this is with a guitar tuner. These devices are available at most music stores. Set your tuner according to the string you are tuning, play that string, and the tuner will indicate whether you are sharp or flat. Adjust the tuning peg by twisting it to raise flat notes and lower sharp notes until your tuner indicates the note is in tune.


You can also use a tuning fork, a pitch pipe, or some other instrument that is already in tune to tune your guitar. Play the instrument of each string and tune the strings one at a time until they are perfectly in tune with the note played by the tuning fork, pitch pipe, or tuned instrument.;
, In reggae, the strumming generally is on the offbeat. The offbeat is on the ""and"" that occurs in between the beats of a 4:4 time signature song. So if you're counting the beats ""1... 2... 3... 4,"" imagine an ""and"" in between each main beat. This is the offbeat.


A simple reggae strum pattern uses a down-strum on the ""and"" like ""1 (and) 2 (and) 3 (and) 4 (and) 1..."" Your first strum should be a down-strum.There are some exceptions to the ""play on the offbeat"" rule. Music is largely about conveying a sense of feeling or getting into a groove.
The strumming of the strings is referred to by many different names in reggae. Some call it a ""chop,"" ""skank,"" or ""bang."", This is the second most common strum pattern in reggae music. Once you down-strum on the offbeat, draw your hand back across the strings upwards in an up-strum.


Once you are more experienced with reggae, you may be able to alternate between playing down-strums and down-up strums, but while learning it may be easiest to stick with one at a time.
Another common strum pattern is to single strum on the first offbeat and then do a down-up strum on the second offbeat., Use firm pressure with your left hand on the fretboard to lessen the sound produced in the strings while strumming. This will create a quality of sound that's called ""chicken scratch"" in funk music.By muting the strings and focusing on the strum pattern, it's likely you'll pick up the groove of reggae music more quickly.

, Pick one of your favorite reggae songs and listen to it to get a feel for the rhythm. Then play the song a second time, only this time strum in time with the chords that are played in the recording. Don't worry if you don't know the chords that are being played. This exercise is just to help you get a feel for the rhythm.Again, you may find it easiest to strum along with the song you have chosen by muting the strings with firm pressure in your left hand across the fretboard. This way, you won't be distracted by the sound and can focus on matching the rhythm.

, Now that you've gotten the hang of the basic strum patters reggae, you can start working on getting the right sound out of your strings. This requires the right amount of pressure on the strings on the fretboard with your left hand. To get a feel for the effect your left hand pressure has on the sound of your guitar, play chords in reggae rhythm and adjust the pressure in your left hand as you play.Try playing chords with while using extremely light pressure, moderate pressure, heavy pressure with your left hand on the strings.
Your left hand affects the sound of the strum of your chords not just by pressure on the strings but also duration.
While using different levels of pressure, experiment with pressure duration. For example, you might use moderate pressure at the onset followed by the release of your left hand.

, Staccato is a musical term that means notes are played in a clipped, detached fashion from other notes. This quality can be produced by applying quick pressure to the strings with your left hand followed immediately by a sudden release., In reggae, the stuck line is the guitar part that follows along with the bass guitar. This part is generally muted to give a mellow tone to the acoustic accompaniment of the bass.Use moderate pressure with your left hand on your fretboard when playing the stuck line.

Finger pick the notes of the stuck line to create a distinct sound in the notes.

, Try to do this especially with bar chords that extend across the entire fret, like A major. Bar chords are where your finger covers the entire fret. Keep your playing arm loose and swing it down to strum your hand over all strings, from the first to the last.Many times, beginning guitarists will approach the strings on an angle with their right hand. This kind of technique can lead to missed strings in the strum.
You can play reggae with a three or four string strum, but using all five is recommended. This will give you a fuller sound in your playing.
The rhythm of the music is more important than hitting all the strings. As the rhythm becomes easier, you can shift your focus to hitting all the strings., If you play your guitar stiffly, you'll probably notice the sound of your guitar reflect this, causing your guitar to sound too mechanical and stiff for reggae. Try to get into the groove of the music by swaying gently or bobbing along with the rhythm.Your guitar should bounce slightly with your left hand as you push the sound out by drawing your right hand across the strings.

, You can use both major and minor chords as you practice. You should choose chords and chord progressions that fit with the song you are trying to play. For example, you might try a 3-chord progression of the main chords of the song you are practicing.At first, look through the music and pick chords that come easy to you and sound the best together. Then try linking these with more difficult chords.
Take your time connecting the chords together slowly and fluidly. This is a good opportunity for you to practice and learn the song inside and out.
Once you are more comfortable, choose more complex chords and variations to put your own flavor on the sound.

, Some well known reggae musicians you might want to listen to include Bob Marley and the Wailers, Prince Buster, and Jackie Mittoo. Note how these performers play their songs and try to emulate it.


You can look up the chords or the tabs for many of the songs played by professional musicians online. This way you don't have to guess at which chord is being played.

When you are comfortable switching chords, it's time to give it the 'mojo'. Let the palm of your hand - the fleshy part on the side of your pinky rest lightly on the 3 bass strings (E;A;D)
This will give you a thumping sound that imitates a string bass.


, While you are thumping merrily along

",How to Play Dust in the Wind on the Guitar," It is essential that you know the song in and out to understand the rhythm, the flow of the guitar before you begin tackling it yourself. Learn how the song sounds so you know what to shoot for.;
, The tablature is as follows:


e:---------------------|
B:-0---------0--------|
G:--------0---------0-|
D:------0---------0---|
A:-0----------0-------|
E:---------------------|
This style of picking is called Travis Picking, and you use your fingers rather than a pick. The first two zeros on the B and A strings you pick at the same time. Pick the A string with your thumb and pick the B string with your middle finger. Following that, pick the D string with your thumb, followed by picking the G string with your middle finger. Practice this rhythm many times until you can play it with ease.

, This can easily be considered the hardest part. This song has certain groups of chords that are played together, and it is easy to transition between them when you know the pattern. The first pattern concerns the open C chord:


e:-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
B:--x--|-----|-----|-----|-----|
G:-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
D:-----|--x--|-----|-----|-----|
A:-----|-----|--x--|-----|-----|
E:-----|-----|-----|-----|-----| DO NOT PLAY
Make this chord with your fretting hand and play the Travis Picking with your picking hand. Sound familiar? To change to the next chord in the sequence, remove your finger from the B string on the neck to create a new chord, Cmaj7:
e:-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
B:-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
G:-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
D:-----|--x--|-----|-----|-----|
A:-----|-----|--x--|-----|-----|
E:-----|-----|-----|-----|-----| DO NOT PLAY
When Travis Picked, this is the second part of the song. The next chord in the sequence is formed by putting your pinky on the 3rd fret of the B string. By doing this, you form Cadd9:
e:-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
B:-----|-----|--x--|-----|-----|
G:-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
D:-----|--x--|-----|-----|-----|
A:-----|-----|--x--|-----|-----|
E:-----|-----|-----|-----|-----| DO NOT PLAY
These chords may take a while to get the hang of, as you've probably never worked with them before. Practice changing between them before you use the Travis Picking on them.
The next set of chords concerns the open Am chord:
e:-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
B:--x--|-----|-----|-----|-----|
G:-----|--x--|-----|-----|-----|
D:-----|--x--|-----|-----|-----|
A:-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
E:-----|-----|-----|-----|-----| DO NOT PLAY
If you know basic chords, you have probably dealt with this chord before. This shouldn't be much of a problem. The changes to this chord that form the next in the set is very similar to what you did to the open C chord. Here's the next chord, Asus2:
e:-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
B:-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
G:-----|--x--|-----|-----|-----|
D:-----|--x--|-----|-----|-----|
A:-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
E:-----|-----|-----|-----|-----| DO NOT PLAY
Easy enough, right? The next chord may be a little trickier for you. Use your pinky to hit that 3rd fret on the B string. Asus4:
e:-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
B:-----|-----|--x--|-----|-----|
G:-----|--x--|-----|-----|-----|
D:-----|--x--|-----|-----|-----|
A:-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
E:-----|-----|-----|-----|-----| DO NOT PLAY
After learning and practicing all of these chords, you are ready to form the intro.

, Everything that you have learned and practiced as of now is going to help you form the intro of the song. Here is the order of the chords used in the intro. For every chord written, Travis Pick it twice.


C | Cmaj7 | Cadd9 | C | Asus2 | Asus4 | A | Asus2
Cadd9 | C | Cmaj7 | Cadd9 | A | Asus2 | Asus4(Pick only once) | G/A(Pick only once)

, Now that you have the intro and Travis picking down, you want to start focusing on the verses. The Travis picking stays basically the same, save a few exceptions. Here's the key to reading the following chord tablature: (EADGBe). The chords are as follows:


C - Fingering: (x3201x) Use the same Travis picking pattern.
G/B - Fingering: (x2003x)
Am - Fingering: (x0221x)
G - Fingering: (3x000x) Do the same Travis picking pattern, except move your picking thumb down for the low G.
Dm7 - Fingering: (xx0211) Same Travis picking pattern, just move your picking fingers up to play the notes.
D/F# - Fingering: (2x023x)
Am/G - Fingering: (3x221x) This one can be tricky at first. Keep practicing, you'll get it.
Let's piece it all together. This is how you play the verse. For every time you see a chord name, Travis pick it twice.
C | G/B | Am | Am | G | Dm7 | Am | G/B
C | G/B | Am | Am | G | Dm7 | Am | Am
D/F# | G | Am | Am/G | D/F# | G
These chords are the same for verses 1 and 2. In verse three, there is an extra line added:
Am | Am/G | D/F# | G | Am | Am/G | D/F# | G

, At this point, you should have mastered Travis picking and all of the chords up to this point. If not, keep practicing before you move on to this part. Just as a note, the guitar doesn't sound especially pretty without the violin accompaniment. If you're going to play this song on your own, you may wish to play the intro a couple times as a substitute.


There are a couple more chords you must learn to play the interlude. They are as follows:
F#11/A - Fingering: (x0350x)
F6#11/A - Fingering: (x0353x)
Each time you see a chord name, Travis pick it twice. The solo is played as follows:
Asus2 | Asus2 | G/A | G/A | F#11/A | F#11/A | F6#11/A | F6#11/A
Asus2 | Asus2 | G/A | G/A | F#11/A | F#11/A | F6#11/A | F6#11/A
Asus2 | Asus2 | G/A | G/A | F#11/A | F#11/A | F6#11/A | F6#11/A
C | Cmaj7 | Cadd9 | C | Asus2 | Asus4 | A | Asus2
Cadd9 | C | Cmaj7 | Cadd9 | A | Asus2 | Asus4(Pick only once) | G/A(Pick only once)

, Now that you know the individual pieces, it's time to make them into one song. Here is the order:

Acoustic kits. This is the most common type of kit in a band and you usually see this one more often. It is much louder than an electronic drum kit and will require soundproofing or some sort of isolated room to keep everyone from getting annoyed with you. An acoustic kit also takes up more room.
Electronic drum kits. These are better for beginners. They are smaller, quieter and are easier to use as you don't have to worry about tuning or anything. An electronic drum kit is recommended for beginners who can barely play. You do not need to soundproof a room to use on of these as you could just turn the volume down.;
, Figure out what you are willing to spend.

, Decide how large (# of drums) you want your drum set to be. This should be based on the size of the room where your drum set will be and how skilled you are as a drummer. 4-piece sets (1-bass, 1-snare, 1-floor tom, and 1-rack tom) are typically the minimum; still, the most common drum set is the 5-piece set (1-bass, 1-snare, 1-floor tom, and 2-rack toms). Of course you can go larger and can even venture into having 2 bass drums; however, I would only recommend a 2 bass drum set for advanced double bass players. Do not forget that you can buy a small drum set and add onto it later.

, Decide how serious or skilled you are regarding drumming. The more serious and skilled you are the higher quality drum set you should get. NOTE: Your price range and skill will affect the size of your set.

, Decide the type of sound you are looking for. Different types of wood will provide a different sound. I have provided some basic information on drum wood below.

, Look in local stores or online for information on specific drum set brands. The best websites for finding brands are guitarcenter.com and musiciansfriend.com. You should pick 2 or 3 brands that you are interested in. These picks should be based on quality of the brand, the prices of their drum sets, guarantees, etc. After picking your brands, visit their website and other websites to find what professionals and fellow drummers say about these brands.

, Once you have decided what brands you want, go to local stores or online and look for their different drum set models. Make sure that the models within your price range offer what you want. The best websites when looking to buy an instrument are guitarcenter.com and musiciansfriend.com. They have a great variety of drum sets and will always offer the lowest price and will beat any other offered prices.

, Go to a store and play the drum sets they have. Some local stores will provide the drum sets you want; however, Guitar Center stores offer the greatest variety and highest quality of try out drums. If you cannot find your set in a local store, go online and try to find sample sound clips of the set.

, After looking through and playing all the drum sets, pick around 4-6 and read reviews on those sets. Read reviews from both professionals and fellow drummers.

, Pick 2-3 final sets and go back to the store and play them. Re-read reviews. Decide the advantages and disadvantages of each set (price, quality, brand, included items…)

, Talk to the people there and tell them that you are interested in drumming. Don't feel pressured to buy on your first day, in fact, don't even bring money. Tell the people there that you are not looking to buy straight away, you just want to have a look. Test both the electronic kit and the acoustic kit if they let you.

,


An electronic kit. If you've chosen an electronic kit, look into some good brands. Some shops are very expensive, so don't feel that an £800 drum kit is always better than a £300 one. Having said that, more expensive kits are usually your best bet. You need to spend at least £100, £200 if you can.
An acoustic kit. If you've chosen an acoustic kit, look into some good brands, kits and soundproofing if necessary. You can soundproof cheaply, research some of these methods too. Again, you will need to spend at least £100 but most of the time, an electronic kit is more expensive so there's no need to spend over £200 on your first kit.

, Go to the store and choose your kit. Be sure to play around on it first to make sure it's the right one for you. If it isn't, repeat the last step.

Browse for used drum sets.,
Inspect the drum shells.,
Inspect the hardware of each drum.,
Assess the condition of the cymbals, if applicable.,
Inspect any included hardware.,
Play the drum set if possible.,
Know what to pay.",How to Buy a Used Drum Set," There are several places to look for used sets; begin your search by browsing online classifieds sites like Craigslist. These sites have the advantage of being hosted locally, which allows you to inspect the drum set in person before buying. Auction sites like eBay are also a good option, but if you are having the kit shipped make sure to request detailed photos so you can inspect it. Pawn shops and local music supply stores may also sell used drum sets.;
, When buying a used set, you can't guarantee that the set has been well taken care of. The first area to inspect is the shell of each drum - the cylindrical wood body. Shells should be completely free from cracks, and should present with minimal to no scratches or scuffs. They should be almost perfectly circular, which can be observed via the gap between the shell and the rim. This gap should be consistent all the way around the shell.


Damaged shells cannot be replaced for less than the cost of buying a new drum, so do not purchase a kit with cracked or warped shells.






Shells can sustain damage through improper handling (such as being dropped or banged against things) or subjection to extreme temperatures or humidity.







, A drum's hardware consists of 2 rims that hold the heads on, tension rods that secure the rims, and lugs that accept the tension rods. Make sure none of these parts are missing or bent. Use a drum key to tighten each tension rod, making sure that the threads are not stripped. Note that small parts like tension rods and washers can be replaced easily and economically if necessary.

, If the drum set is being sold with cymbals, check their condition as well. Look for cracks along each cymbal's edge, and check for chipping (called ""key-holing"") around the center hole. Dull, discolored cymbals can be cleaned easily, but cracked cymbals cannot be repaired. Note that inexpensive starter cymbal packs are not meant to last very long, and you can always elect to purchase new cymbals.

, Necessary drum hardware includes the throne (seat), the bass drum pedal, and the cymbal stands. These parts, if included in the sale, should be free from dents. All moving parts should operate smoothly, and threaded assemblies should be checked for stripping.

, Playing the drum set will tell you what a close inspection cannot - whether or not the drums sound good. If you are new to drums, consider bringing an experienced drummer along to the purchase to play the drums for you.

, Once you find a set that is in good condition, you still need to avoid overpaying for it. Look up the model online and see what it sells for new. If the exact model is no longer produced, look at other sets produced by the manufacturer. Ideally, you want to purchase the used set at a significantly lower price than a new one, with additional deductions made if the kit is damaged.

Get enough plywood to build your cajon.,
Cut out the required sheets of plywood.,
Trace a 12cm diameter hole on the rear piece.,
Fashion your snares.,
Glue the basic frame.,
Apply pressure.,
Attach the snares before gluing on the tapa.,
Glue on the tapa and the back piece.,
Cut out feet from leftover pieces of wood and screw them to the bottom.,
Round the top side corners to make it more comfortable to sit on.,
Give it some flair.",How to Build a Cajon," Generally, a cajon is made of two different thicknesses of wood, thinner for the striking surface and slightly thicker for the rest of the instrument.








Use 1/8 inch plywood for the tapa. The tapa is the striking surface of the instrument, and you'll generally use a piece sized 13 inch by 19 inch for most cajons.
For the other sides of the instrument, use 1/2 inch plywood.;
, Prepare the body of the cajon by cutting the correct measurements to form the basic box. Make sure the cuts are very straight by clamping a metal ruler to the sheet of plywood and using a jigsaw or circular saw.









The top and bottom pieces should be 13 inch by 13 inch
The single rear piece should be 13 inch by 18 inch
The sides should be 12 1/2 inch by 18 inch

, Drill a hole towards the edge of the marked sound hole, and use that as a starting point to cut out the sound hole with a jigsaw.









Round and sand the edges to create an even and clean edge.

, One of the distinctive things about the sound of the cajon is the snare-drum-like rattle made when hitting the tapa. This comes from attaching several strings of snares you can either make yourself, salvage from an old snare drum, or use new snares and attach to the inside of the drum.








A snare is basically a string or wire stretched to tension and outfitted with something that rattles. If you wanted to make your own, using old guitar strings, fishing line, or other wire would be perfectly appropriate for a homemade cajon. For rattles, try paperclips, sinkers, or other tiny metal salvaged materials that make a good rattling sound.

, Start with the base and one of the side pieces, applying a liberal amount of wood glue. Next, glue the other side piece and the top to create the basic frame.









Have a helper steady the pieces as you add the glue and keep them as straight as possible, or cut guide pieces to keep inside the box and ensure straight angles.

, Big carpentry clamps would be ideal, but luggage straps will do in a pinch. Strap ample pressure to the piece while the wood glue dries. Let it sit for several hours before adding the back, tapa, and snares.









Wipe off any excess glue with a wet cloth and read the instructions for the particular variety of wood glue you purchase for advice about pressure and drying time.

, Depending on what you're using for snares, you can do this in a variety of different ways. Ideally, you might purchase some tuning pegs from the music store to be able to ""tune"" the snares periodically.









Stretch the snares diagonally from the top corners of the side that will be the tapa, roughly 3 inches from each corner on the top and on the side. Screw them in with wood screws, or attach them to tuning pegs for more control over the sound.

, Apply the front and back piece as before and apply pressure for the same length of time. Orient the back piece so that the sound hole is at the base of the instrument, and the snares are at the top. You might also consider applying wood screws for added stability in your instrument. You're going to be sitting on it, so it's worth putting some extra strength into it.








, Rubber or cork can also be used. It's ideal to have a somewhat cushioning surface to set the box on, since it's going to be holding up your weight as well. Putting plywood on the ground can scratch some surfaces.








, Use sandpaper and take some time smoothing out the edges and the surfaces. Sand your cajon with progressively finer sanding paper, then finish to your liking.








, Decorate the instrument with your own personal style. Finish it will wood stain for a professional and classy look, or hook it up with psychedelic Neptunes and polar bears for a wild hippy look. Have fun with it.

Assess your requirements and constraints regarding the bass drum.,
Decide what size bass drum you want.,
Determine what kind of wood you want your bass drum constructed from.,
Purchase your bass drum.",How to Buy a Bass Drum," The bass drum's tone and volume are 2 things that you should consider, keeping your desired use of the drum in mind.


If the bass drum will be used primarily in a practice setting, it may be important to keep the volume to a minimum to avoid disturbing neighbors and housemates. This can generally be accomplished through a smaller drum size with a thinner shell.
If the drum will be used in a performance setting, you should consider the tone and volume appropriate for the style of music and size of venues played. A large, thundering bass drum would be inappropriate for use in a jazz combo, for example.;
, The dimensions of the bass drum--both diameter and depth--influence the drum's volume, pitch, and ease of use. Larger drums produce loud, low-pitched tones; they can also be difficult to play due to the excessive movement of the drumhead. Smaller bass drums produce a punchier, more articulate sound, and tend to be quieter.


By far the most common diameters are 20 inches (50 cm) and 22 inches (55 cm). The 20 inch bass drum is well-suited to jazz, pop, and other general applications, while the 22 inch drum works well for louder rock playing.
Smaller bass drums, with diameters of 16 inches (40 cm) or 18 inches (45 cm), produce a high-pitched, controlled, punchy sound. They are ideal for very quiet performances in small venues.
Larger bass drums, with diameters of 24 inches (60 cm) and above, produce a huge, thundering sound that works well for loud rock music.
The depth of most bass drums will be 14 inches (35 cm) or 16 inches (40 cm). Longer depths will deepen the pitch of the drum, while shorter depths will raise it.

, There are many types of wood used in drum construction, each with their own tonal characteristics. Maple, by far the most common wood used, lends a balanced tone to the drum. Birch drums have a bright, punchy sound, while mahogany drums have a warm, vintage character. Poplar and falcata are 2 low-cost woods used in budget drums.

, After deciding on the characteristics that are important to you, you can purchase a bass drum from a music store or an online retailer. Searching online allows you to narrow your search based on the characteristics you want in a bass drum.

Determine the size of your completed drum and the number of tones you wish to produce.,
Calculate an inch and a quarter wide section of lid for each tone.,
Construct a solid wood box from straight grained hardwood.,
Carefully glue, screw, and corner block all edges to form a box that is solid and airtight.

Using a Drill press, drill out the ends of each cut line.

,
Use a saber saw or skill saw to cut the lines for your tongues.

,

,
Adjust the length(s) of your striking tongue(s) to tune your drum.",How to Build an Eight Tone Drum,";
, (1 inch tongue, with a quarter inch spacing on either side for cutting and sanding) A two tone drum could be as narrow as 3 inches (7.6 cm) if you placed the tongues end to end with their striking ends in the center.

, The sides and bottom should be a minimum of half an inch thick, with larger boxes having thicker walls.

Learn to play variety of styles.,
Hone your style.,
Practice drumming on a pillow.",How to Become a Professional Drummer1," Speed up your tempo only after you are comfortable playing rudiments at a slower pace.;
, Because keeping solid time is so integral to playing drums, a metronome is a necessary component to at least a portion of any practice session.

, Listening to music you are unfamiliar with can also help ease you into a new style.

, Most professional drummers who get hired for studio work have a ""toolbox"" of drumming styles that they can draw from, which might include jazz, rock, funk, bossa nova, rockabilly, salsa, samba, or blues beats.

, Instead of jumping ahead to learn new drumbeats every week, work through the styles you already know and practice them to perfection. Practice every song or beat until you can play it comfortably and confidently.

, The lack of bounce you feel when you strike a pillow with a drumstick forces your wrists to work harder, which will benefit you when you play on an actual drum.

, A CD showcasing your abilities is a simple method of letting potential employers or band mates know what you can do.


Record a few solid tracks that highlight your drumming skills. It should be strong representation of your ability, and it should include some versatility in musical genres.

, Carefully listen to all of the tracks you can find from the artist for whom you are auditioning. Practice the songs you are going to be playing by continuously running through them before the gig.

, Knowing how to sight read a drum chart will impress during an audition, and it often can make a studio session run much more smoothly.

, Tune your drums before a gig or audition. Replace old, worn out drumheads.

, If an audition or performance goes badly, try to pinpoint what went wrong and straighten it out for the next time. Use your shortcomings to motivate you to improve your craft.

, Playing live is vastly different than playing in the studio, and musicians are often judged by whether their live performance is up to par.

Before even attempting this, make sure you are ready break a few strings (mainly GBe) and practice, practice, practice.,
Start off by stretching out your finger place your index finger on the first fret (any string will do) and stretch your pinky to place it on the fifth fret.,
Now to get down to actually playing start off by picking a single string at 4-5 notes a second (yes start off slow we all did), then start doing this and changing notes on this same string (playing one note repeatedly, then switching to another note and doing the same).,
The saying practice makes perfect definitely applies here.,
Learn DragonForce rhythm guitar for songs.,
Get some technical music and learn to play these songs by ear or from tab.,
Once you have mastered some songs that require technicality, look up the chords and finger positions used in the songs and get used to them (e.g.,

, Next do the same except with the finger next to your pinky and you should be able to fit 1.5 to 2.5 frets in between your first and third finger. Finally do the same with your middle finger one fret spacing will be just fine. WARNING: Do this at the bottom of the fretboard (where the frets are larger) or you defeat the purpose of this exercise.

, This will build character in your hands, fingers and skill. Just like the next step.

, To train your fingers and to exercise your hands so they have the endurance and strength to play that fast you have practice and soon you will have the speed to pick a string as fast as 11-18 notes a second while placing your fingers accurately on frets you can and improvising your own solo.

, Its good to learn by tab but if, eventually, you can learn by ear that is even better.

, Bands such as Necrophagist, Zyklon, Arch Enemy and Children Of Bodom have some good songs to learn and get your skill up. Learning to play Jimi Hendrix songs faster than usual is definitely a help. Please note that this step takes a lot of time and devotion so do not rush it.

Do your research!,
Consider the limits of the sound quality produced by the equipment being purchased.,
Purchase the correct guitar.,
Purchase the accessories for the guitar.",How to Play Guitar Like Jimi Hendrix1," If you are truly striving for classic rock'n'roll sound, it takes research. Lots of research. There are a lot of resources on the internet that can tell you exactly what equipment was used and because of today's high technology, there are pedals and computer programs that can take a music file and process it to sound like the original riff.


To find out about guitars from the experts, go to a guitar show. Most cities have one (or even two) each year. You can have all of your questions answered there and see and test out hundreds of types of guitars to find the best fit for you.
When you really want a sound from before the 1980s, remember the equipment was different. Sound systems were not as clear and amps had tubes in the brain. Modern technology has advantages over old equipment by reliability and reduced weight, but the sound is sacrificed. You can come pretty close with the use of pedals and a great sound man, so you don't need a wall of amps or full band anymore.;
, Guitar legends depend on their amps and equipment, as much as their guitar, for their sound. Face it, you're not gonna get The Who's wall of sound from a single small portable amp. There is a very small battery powered amp that clips to your belt so you can walk around playing through headsets.

, You will need a guitar, but not just any guitar. Get a guitar within a price range of $100 and $500. Anything less than that will produce poor sound and make playing difficult. Guitars like these are destined to collect dust in the corners of a kid's room. Go to a place such as Sam Ash or Guitar Center, where they will let you play their guitars until you find one that's perfect for you.


Hendrix himself played a Fender Stratocaster. If you want to sound similar to him, purchase the guitar of that brand.

, Although Hendrix was most often known for the right-handed Fender Stratocaster played upside-down, 100-watt Marshalls, and lots of pedals, it is not at all necessary for one to clone this set-up. If one has played electric for any time at all, they should have learned that one's sound is everything from the type of picks, strings, pick-ups, cords, petals, amps, tubes, speakers, and cabinets, any one of which can have a profound impact on getting you where you want to be.


Find the correct tuner. There are a lot to choose from and they are easy to use. For about $10 a clip on will be everything you'll ever need. They are small and easy to take along with you. A tuner saves a lot of time and gets you playing fast. With a clip on, leave it clipped to the top of the guitar. You'll use it every time you play. No, it won't hurt the guitar neck.
Get a guitar stand that is easy to fold up, carry around and set up. Take it everywhere.
Shop around to find the most comfortable guitar strap (maybe two, they're cheap!) These should wide enough to distribute the weight of the guitar across your shoulders.
Get a case. One with a hard shell is great but a soft knit bag is fine. The guitar will be dry, cool, and it keeps dents and scratches to a minimum. Remember, every scratch will be there forever.

Guitar picks are optional . The best advice is to find the weight pick that's comfortable in your hand and get a whole bunch. Not sure what feels right? Go to a guitar show and people will give you lots of free picks. Experiment and keep the ones you like. Give away the ones you don't and other players will think you're a nice guy! You don't always have to play with a pick, but have 'em around just in case.
Get a good Marshall amp head with two speakers (cabinets) underneath it. This is referred to as a 'Marshall Full Stack'. Getting an old Marshall that uses tubes will sound most like Jimi's, but they cost more. If you can't afford a Marshall, any other amp will be good enough. Or just get a good cheaper amp, maybe a Fender.
Get a Wah Pedaland a Distortion Pedal which are required if learning Voodoo Chile (Slight Return)' is desired. This can be purchased later as your playing skill become advanced.

Take some lessons in guitar playing.,
Start learning the basic guitar chords and scales.,
Practice and improvise constantly!",How to Play Guitar Like Jimi Hendrix2," Before you master a legend like Hendrix you must be well acquainted with some basic guitar skills. This will make it easier to go along. Rather you are holding a guitar for the very first time or a seasoned pro. Lessons and practice are always a great way to get started or refreshed on the proper techniques and new technology and advances of this interest or hobby. Different people learn things better in different formats. Some learn better with a book and chart, others learn better with visuals like videos on the web and DVDs. Still others learn better enrolling in a class with an actual instructor. Find the learning format that best suits you.


Make sure the courses or materials you get involved in or purchase for the lessons are relevant and accurate. Some ""courses"" are actually non-existing and may be scam. Not all up to date books on guitars are really accurate and are just repeats of older books.This also applies to web sites and Youtube videos be careful.
It really doesn't matter if the person on the video is a music legend or not. As long as the music note lessons are correct and the sound is equal to Jimi Hendrix.
Make sure you also get chord charts that are available in many music stores or download them from websites. These are really handy for memorizing chords and notes.

, This will give you basic knowledge of the instrument. An instructor could help too, but Jimi didn't have one (but then again, at first he didn't have a real guitar either). Whenever starting a new craft or interest it's always a great idea to learn the rules and basics first. Once you know the rules you can break and bend them as many artists do after learning them.

, This is how Jimi got his solos. Make sure you learn blues scales to improvise on. Elvis, B.B. King, and Muddy Waters were Jimi's influences. So listen to these and other styles of music as well. It's going to feel frustrating, but if Jimi taught us one thing, it's to never give up.

Take hints from the truly great guitar players of years past.,
Inspire yourself with the life story of Jimi Hendrix himself.,
Think of the crafty Robert Johnson who combined different playing styles into an original style all his own.,
Motivate yourself with the story of Jimmy Page as inspiration when you get bored of learning basic notes and chords.",How to Play Guitar Like Jimi Hendrix3," Yes, they learned a few things from other players, maybe took a few lessons, but the greats broke away from the herd and took music into their own hands. When you think about many artist using any media or art form in one way or another somehow got inspired by another artist who did the same thing. Read or watch biographies about artists that interest you. You don't have to just stick to Hendrix.

, Hendrix began playing guitar at 15, played music around Tennessee but found fame playing in England. He only played electric guitar and experimented with the sound. Before him, even though electric guitars had been around since 1931, they were played the same as an acoustic. Where most musicians simply amplified what they played, Hendrix used feedback, bending strings and percussion noises on the solid body guitar during his performances to distort and enhance the usual string sound. Every time he played live, the sound was different. His career spanned only four years, but he is still considered the most influential electric guitarist in the history of rock music.

, This guy is the legendary guitarist who people say sold his soul at the crossroads to the devil for the special guitar licks that no one can duplicate. The story goes that he learned a few things from other players, disappeared for a while, then suddenly reappeared playing a one of a kind style. He recorded 29 songs in a room at the Baker Hotel in Dallas, TX, in 1937, and every rock and roll (and blues) song is an extension of his work.

, He started off learning a few chords by a friend, got bored and taught himself to play by listening to records. He began live performances at 13, did studio session work for years, was a member of The Yardbirds, and by 26 had formed Led Zeppelin. Most of the recorded guitar solos from 1960 to 1968 in England were played by him, including work with The Who, The Kinks, Herman's Hermits and The Rolling Stones.

Remember Hendrix had a unique anatomy that allowed him play the guitar in a very unique way.,
Learn Jimi Hendrix unique ""guitaristic"" move.,
Practice learning the notes while learning the Hendrix Chords.",How to Play Guitar Like Jimi Hendrix4," He had extremely large hands with long fingers. This allowed him to do some things that just cannot be imitated by all (example: he could wrap his right thumb {he was left hand dominant, so his right hand played the fret board} around the top of the neck and play the two low strings such as low E and A two frets below his first finger. This allowed him to play dominant 7 barre (or bar-) chords with a 7th and 3rd in the bass (as opposed to the typical 1 and 5, or ""power chord"" .


Look at a more Conventional Barre Chord. Use the photographs to compare the Conventional Barre Chord to A La Jimi Chord. The first photo is the Conventional Chord which is a Barre Chord that most guitarists first learn.
Now examine the A La Jimi Chord. This second photo is the Hendrix aka A La Jimi Hendrix Chord was a not a Conventional Barre Chord. Notice the different hand and finger positions.
A note on left-hand technique: normally it would be terrible technique for the wrist to be collapsed against the neck like this. Frankly doing it too often or in an unrelaxed manner is a great way to get carpal tunnel syndrome. But call this is an ‘advanced technique,’ and Hendrix himself had huge hands with long fingers. One does not need to play the 'Hendrix way' to sound very very close to the real thing. In general the wrist should be straight, with the thumb gently against the neck allowing you to squeeze and also one rotates on the thumb like it’s a lever when doing vibrato.

, He invented his own unique, highly ""guitaristic"" move whereby he placed his first finger on the first fret of the 2nd string, third finger on third fret of the 4th, and fourth finger on the third fret of the 1st string, then played these, along with the open 3rd string, and rapidly slide this finger formation up and down. This can be heard in parts of 'Watchtower,' 'Castles Made of Sand,' among other places. (Whole move with variations could be diagrammed with tablature).

, Use tablature or whatever means, and than play them the best you can according to your own gifts. Familiarizing oneself in the blues, esp. delta (Robert Johnson) and Chicago (Muddy Waters, Buddy Guy, Magic Sam) styles, can help too.

Learn the characteristics of the "" Hendrix Chord"" which really refers to a couple things.,
Learn the E7#9 Chord.,
Learn the other Jimi Chord which Hendrix also played Purple Haze another way.This is sometimes called “The Jimi Hendrix Chord:”E-major in root position.",How to Play Guitar Like Jimi Hendrix5," Primarily it's a dominant 7 with a #9 in a particular shape - and in particular the E7#9 which among other places is featured heavily in ‘Purple Haze’ (the other 2 chords of the song being the bars as above on 3rd and 5th frets (G and A)).

, Notice the two E-strings are played open, resulting in a very ‘guitaristic’ sound. 1st finger fourth string 6th fret; 2nd finger fifth string 7th fret; 3rd finger third string 7th fret; 4th finger second string 8th fret.

, Refer to the photograph.


The 5th string is not strummed. Notice the pinky poised.
Then add the 7 and 9 to the chord:
This is simply an E-major triad, with ‘bluesy' ornaments added in a pinky-finger barre (optional, use the 3rd and 4th finger for each note) on the 1st and 2nd strings. The 7 of an E-chord is the D-note (3rd fret second string), the 9 is the G-note (3rd fret first string).
This formation and ornament can be played anywhere up the neck, but as a bar-chord (see above). Again, in Purple Haze Jimi would wrap his thumb around for the bass on the 6th string (functioning as the nut does in open position) while muffling or not strumming the 5th string.
Another chord and sound particularly associated with Hendrix which some call ’the Hendrix chord’ - featured very prominently in the sliding chords which open and close ‘Castles Made of Sand.’
As in ‘Castles,’ the first chord is a Gadd9 (also called ‘Gsus2' in poor rock and roll music theory) at the 3th fret (actual first chord is debatable because the maneuver is faded in, but the home key is G): 1st finger second string 3th fret; 3rd finger fourth string 5th fret; 4th finger first string 5th fret; note: second finger does not feature here (some people online think otherwise), and the third string is played open, requiring the 3rd finger to be rather arched.
Jimi slides this formation up and down the neck, always with the 3rd string remaining open. This provides a drone effect which, along with the interval of a 5th in the two highest strings, can be considered alternatively ’psychedelic’ or, in musicological terms, East Indian in flavor (the Beatles’ encounter with Indian music and spirituality made this a popular thing at the time).

Choose your preferred brand.,
Try out the drumsticks.",How to Choose Drumsticks," Drumsticks are usually made of either maple, hickory, or a Japanese white oak. Laminated birch has also recently regained popularity. Each has a slightly different feel. The feel has to do with how the stick transmits or absorbs vibration and how much it flexes.Hickory is a common, well rounded wood for drumsticks. Hickory is favored for its flexibility and impact resistance.
Maple is much lighter than hickory, allowing for a larger diameter feel without the weight. Maple is softer and stiffer than maple, which negative impacts the sticks durability. Maple sounds sweeter and brighter on drums and cymbals.
Oak is dense and heavy, but transmits vibrations more. It tends to be more durable, but will split with little warning. The increased weight gives drums a bigger, darker sound and yields a very big, but brash cymbal sound.
Laminated Birch is made from a high quality birch plywood. These sticks are very heavy and durable. They generate very deep sounds from drums and cymbals.
There are smaller companies specializing in exotic woods and Vic Firth is currently making a carbon fiber stick. Also, companies like Ahead make sticks out of nylon.;
, Tips come in wood, nylon, or delrin. Nylon tips sound brighter on cymbals and hold up longer without chipping or developing soft spots. They don't typically change the sound of the drums, though the lighter tip weight can create a fast rebound, allowing the drum to speak easier. Delrin is used by some companies in place or nylon since it is supposedly more durable.


Wooden tips have a darker contact sound and a less articulate sound on cymbals.

, Tips come in a wide variety of shapes, each with its on sound. Common tip shapes are barrel, acorn, ball, and oval. Each shape has a particular sound. Each shape also comes in multiple sizes. Smaller creates a more articulate sound while larger tips create bigger and deeper sounds. Some companies shape their nylon tips like wood tips; others do not.


Barrel tips have a wide, flat contact surface. This creates a dark, but strong contact sound.
Acorn tips have the largest contact surface. This dampens the contact sound significantly, creating a full, but dark cymbal sound.
Ball tips have a very small contact surface, creating a very bright contact sound.
Oval tips are between barrel and ball tips.

, The thickness also changes the sound. There are two ways to know the thickness of a stick. The first is by model number. A's are thinner than B's, which are thinner than S's. Higher numbers represent thinner sticks. So, a 7A is thinner than a 5A, which is in turn smaller than a 5B. This system has become unreliable with the wide range of manufacturers each with a large catalog of sticks.


The other way to know the thickness of a stick is to find its diameter. This is usually measured in inches and displayed as a three digit decimal. .500 is a half inch thick, for example. 7As are thinner and lighter. These will sound sweeter on drums and cymbals and are best for lower volume playing.
5As are slightly thicker than the 7A. These are generally considered to be the most generic and versatile stick.
5Bs are thicker, more intense drumsticks and are often used by rock and metal drummers due to their weight.
There are many other models and each company has its own idiosyncrasies. For example, Promark has a thinner 5A than most. Vic Firth's 7A is shorter than most while their 8D is more like everyone's 7A.

,


Hold the stick as you would while playing. Let it slide through your fingers.
Different manufacturers use different coatings that affect grip. Vic Firth favors a thin lacquer while Regal Tip favors a heavy lacquer, making their sticks a bit slicker and more resistant to skin oils and moisture. Promark favors a special finish that becomes tacky as your hands heat it up. Promark also offers many sticks finished only by sanding. Zildjian and Vic Firth also offer many sticks with a rubber coating offer the butt end of the stick.
The only way to know what you like is to play with the sticks.

, There are many brands of good drumsticks to compare, maybe you could think about your favorite artist's preference in sticks when choosing your own. Here are the top brands with some of their endorsers.


Ahead (Lars Ulrich, Rick Allen) - Ahead is favored by metal drummers due to the durability and weight of their sticks. However, many complain that the sticks hurt their hands.






ProMark (Joey Jordison, Mike Portnoy, Glenn Kotche, Benny Greb) - Promark lacks diversity in tip shapes, but offers some great finish options.






Vater (Chad Smith, David Silvera) - Vater is creates a product much like Vic Firths, but with different shapes.






Vic Firth (John Dolmayan, Vinnie Paul, Mark Guiliana) - Vic Firth offers probably the widest selection of sticks. They favor a light lacquer finish and many of their sticks are painted. ]
Zildjian (Dave Grohl, Travis Barker)







, Especially if you're choosing a new kind of drumstick or a brand or size you haven't used before, ask if you can try them. Try them gently on a practice pad so that if you choose something else, the store can still sell them, but try them enough to get a feel for their weight, springiness, and balance.

Purchase a bongo based on your skill level.,
Choose between a wood drum or a fiberglass drum.,
Select whether you would like synthetic or rawhide heads.,
Select the style of head you want: flat or pre-fitted.,
Pick the size of bongo that suits you.",How to Buy a Bongo Drum," Different drums are available for beginner players and for more advanced drummers.


A beginner bongo is smaller and does not weigh as much as drums made for more skilled players.
A bongo for an advanced drummer is typically more expensive due to better quality heads and rims and more ornate design.;
, The difference between the 2 materials is the tone of the sound of the drum. When it is played, a fiberglass drum offers a bright pop, while a wooden drum sends out an earthly, hollow sound.

,


When deciding on a rawhide skin to purchase, hold it up to the light. Look for an evenly colored skin, which indicates a skin of uniform thickness. Color variations can suggest the skin is not the same thickness all the way across, which affects the sound quality of the particular skin. Since weather affects rawhide heads, expect changes in tone as the weather changes, and plan on spending more time tuning the head. Warmer weather tightens the head and produces a higher pitch.
Synthetic heads are mass produced of man-made materials and provide a consistent and smooth playing surface. Changes in weather do not affect synthetic heads. Synthetic heads offer a convenience above rawhide heads in that they come already stretched and tucked onto a frame and are ready to mount to the drum and play.

,


Synthetic heads are typically pre-fitted. Pre-fitted heads are convenient to replace quickly. They are not affected by humidity, altering the tuning and sound of the head, as rawhide heads are.
Flat heads give you the decision power of the exact rawhide you want for your drum and the satisfaction of tucking it on your own. If you use flat heads, you will have to learn how to tuck heads, and then each time you tuck one, you will have to wait to play the bongo until the head dries.

,


The size of the drummer can direct you to the size of bongo you purchase. A smaller drum set better accommodating a person of smaller stature.
Sound preference can be instrumental in determining the size of your bongos. Smaller drums offer a higher pitched sound, while the sound of drums with larger heads is deeper.

Listen to music that has great drumming.,
Reproduce the song.,
Search well-known drummers to better understand how many types of drumming are out there.

,
Learn how to keep a steady rhythm, nothing fancy, unless a solo.,
Use metronomes.,
Get into drum solos.,
Follow a measure.,
Have Fun.,
Relax.,
Try practicing single stroke rolls into a pillow.",How to Become a Drummer," This will help you understand what you have the potential to be.;
, It will give you a place to start and help you get better at learning beats, as well as what is essential to making your own beats.

,, This is important if you are looking to be in a band, a steady beat is what everyone loves in a drummer. You may also want to brush on solo skills. Sometimes a solo may be just a new improved kick beat. It could be Neal Peart's YYZ or another marching solo.

, They will save your life. As more and more bands follow metronomes, you will need it more. If you can play along with a metronome, even if it is only a simple beat, that will get you farther than you can imagine.

, These are also important because it gives you a chance to show your skills and gain Rep. You would want to make these simple, but not too simple. Solos need to be fast but do not give the impression that you are just hitting drums without structure. A good place to start is to alternate hitting the toms back and forth while hitting the bass drum. Also, try loosely holding the sticks when you hit the snare a high-hat. When hitting the high-hat in a solo take your foot off the pedal in coalition with your foot hitting the bass pedal. If loosely follow these rules and be creative you will be amazed of what you can accomplish.

, In a four-beat measure try hitting any cymbal for all four beats, then hit the snare on any beat you want, you can even hit the snare twice in the same measure, also try to incorporate the bass drum on all, two, three, or even one, and try changing the bass beat from one measure to another. The possibilities are endless.

, Just let your creativity flow.

, Always remember to be relaxed, but not too relaxed, behind the metronome, but not late. Take it easy on your joints - stretch before drumming.

, It will improve your speed a lot. Practice with a metronome.

Innovate.,
Hendrix was a ""stylist"" in every sense of the word.,
Examine how other artist like Jimi Hendrix use innovation to overcome obstacles.",How to Play Guitar Like Jimi Hendrix6," Jimi used studio tools to great effect. He was constantly innovating because, as he put it, the ""sounds in his head"" could not be reproduced until he or his friends came up with a new technique. Many now standard electric guitar effects can be traced back to Jimi: e.g. wah-wah (foot pedal allowing rapid extreme alterations in tone). The famous slide guitar with heavy echo/reverb solo from 'All Along the Watchtower' was created by Jimi using a Zippo cigarette lighter on its side.


He also experimented and tried new techniques with different models of guitars as well. Firstly, he was left handed but he took a right handed guitar and turned it upside down after re-stringing the guitar from the low to high e-string. Right handed guitarist can do this by getting a voodoo Stratocaster or re-stringing like Hendrix. Also, play around with the setting on your amp. Look around for other effects he used on his guitar. Finally, Hendrix usually thumbs his bass note whilst using hiss other fingers for the rhythm, slides his thumb along the string and heavily uses his whammy bar.

, He started out learning his licks from the players that he admired, then strived to reach into his soul and apply these lessons to create a sound that was Jimi.


Jimi Hendrix never used to play that cleanly, he would just kinda ""Get it done"" quite a lazy, but very very talented and unique player. Also, he used a lot of finger picking/ physical picking combination. As in he would pick some strings with his pick, while finger picking some other strings to get more noise at once that he liked.
Technically: To learn his licks, there are a number of playback devices available that allow you to slow down any particular musical passage, making it easier to find the individual notes that were played. Please note that Hendrix oftentimes would ""slurry"" a number of notes together, making it difficult to identify individual notes, but not impossible.
Aesthetically: Once you've found the notes and chords, play along with some of his tunes, to get the feel of them.....then play the tunes on your own. In my opinion, if you can play a smooth, soulful rendition of ""Little Wing"", you are well on your way.

, Who knows you might learn to play the exact songs as Hendrix with the same notes but in a different technique that better suits your individual circumstances. Aerosmith and Van Halen tune their guitars down 1/2 step. This makes the strings looser and changes the sound. Also, a cappo bar changes the tuning by raising all the strings the same step but doesn't make the strings tighter.


Mark Knopfler (formerly of Dire Straits) likes to cap up on the 2nd fret, it raises the bass line and changes the vocals.
Dolly Parton has massive fingernails but still plays guitar -- her guitar is tuned to a G chord so all she has to do is play bar-chords up and down the neck to make a song.

Start learning the more advanced Hendrix after you mastered the easier ones.",How to Play Guitar Like Jimi Hendrix7," Keep these available for reference as you learn to play Hendrix songs and make corrections, innovations, and edits as you go. Often seeking a Jimi Hendrix albums will lead to more discoveries. Some versions of the same song can be harder than other versions. Many sites when your downloading or viewing a video also have notes available in .pdf or Ebook format for downloading.

, Review the steps above to make sure you are doing everything right. It's always a good idea right before playing to review the notes, chords and techniques to make sure you know the right notes and right positions of the fingers. Reviewing the materials will make sure you have all the right accessories ready to go and in good condition.


Have your guitar ready! Inspiration can strike anytime or anywhere. It should be sitting on the stand with the tuner clipped on top. Throw the guitar strap over your shoulder, do a quick tune, strum some chords. Have a guitar chord chart where you can do a quick reference -- back of a bedroom door, inside a cabinet door, inside a closet door, on the back of the front door. A glance can teach you something new.

, Break out! Sit around with your guitar and experiment. Have a recording device turned on so you can remember what you did. Record everything! Call out what you're doing -- changing tuning, changing equipment, chord names, where your hands are. It will make it easy to duplicate something that sounded good. Otherwise, it could be lost forever. Don't forget to jot things done with pen and paper and to have back up files for song samples just in case the originals get destroyed.


Take breaks often. It's also good to have a drink of water or juice on hand as guitar playing can be strenuous at times like an workout exercise routine. If you fell yourself getting angry and anxious put down the guitar and walk away for a few hours.

, Foxy Lady/Fire are short easy to play. Voodoo Chile (Slight Return),Changes and Purple Haze are the next step requiring the use of the Wah Pedal. These will be pretty easy once you get techniques of the Wah Pedal. Little Wing and Hey Joe have strangely arranged notes. Also these songs are longer and in some parts very fast. All Along The Watchtower is a cover of Bob Dylan which is also pretty easy to learn.

, One song If 6 was 9 is pretty easy until the solo starts. Another one Machine Gun is like 20 minutes or more long!

Point your index finger forward.,
Curl your index finger in.,
Place your drumstick under your index finger.,
Find the balance point.,
Place your thumb on the side of the drumstick.,
Curl the last three fingers onto the drumstick.,
Repeat the steps above for the other hand.,
Strike with a wrist and finger motion.",How to Hold a Drumstick1," For novices, the easiest grip style to begin with is usually American grip. This style is versatile, fairly easy to learn, and offers a good mix of power and control, making it a good choice for almost every drummer and almost every style of music. To begin, raise one hand and turn your wrist so that its palm is facing down and its index finger is pointed out straight ahead, parallel with the floor









For this grip (and the styles below), you'll want your hands to be about an inch (2.5cm) or two above the snare drum head (assuming that you're playing at an ordinary drum set). However, if this isn't comfortable for you, feel free to move your hands to a position that is.;
, Next, bend your index finger at its second and third knuckles so that its tip is more or less aligned with the edge of your palm. This will form a small ""pocket"" that will act as a fulcrum for the drumstick as well as its primary point of support.








, Slide the drumstick into the curled-up pocket formed by your index finger. Your index finger should comfortably wrap around the drumstick as if it's pulling a trigger.








, When you play the drums, you want your sticks to have a little ""spring"" or ""bounce"" when they hit the drum head — they should rebound from the drum head and fall back onto it several times with no effort from you. Experiment by sliding your drumstick up and down in its ""pocket"" until you find the stick placement that gets the most rebounds off the snare drum. You should get about 6-8 bounces when you find the correct balance point.









Though all sticks will be weighted slightly differently, normally, the balance point will be about two-thirds of the way back from the stick tip.

, When you've found the balance point, turn your wrist so that your palm is facing toward the floor once again. Lay your thumb along the side of the drumstick. Keep it on the side — don't turn your palms towards each other to position it on top of the stick (this is what you would do for French Grip).









You don't need to apply much pressure with your thumb, — its job is to simply hold the stick in place and provide a little extra control when playing.

, Wrap your middle, ring, and little finger around underneath the drumstick. Don't grip tightly with these fingers— they should provide good support, but shouldn't prevent the stick from bouncing back from the drum head when you hit it. Eventually, if you study advanced finger control techniques, you'll learn to subtly use these fingers to play with delicate finesse.








, The grip you use should be more or less the same for both hands. Because your grips for each hand match, this type of grip is called a ""matched grip"".









American grip isn't the only kind of matched grip — below, you'll learn several more which offer their own advantages and disadvantages.

, When you're ready to play, hit the drum by flexing your wrist to move the drumstick up and down. Keep your palms facing downward so that they're nearly parallel to the floor. This should ensure that the largest part of your wrist is doing most of the bending. Adjust the tightness of your thumb and supporting fingers to give the stick more or less bounce as needed. Keep your shoulders, forearms and elbows loose, but avoid moving them while you drum unless you need to move to a different drum or cymbal. The drumming motion should come almost entirely from your wrists and fingers.









American grip is highly versatile. Because it offers great control and respectable power while playing, it's a viable choice for anything from swing and jazz drumming to rock and roll to funk and even classical music!

Examine your guitar.,
Take it to the shop.,
Test the connection.,
Listen for the whammy.",How to Use a Guitar Whammy Bar1," Some guitars do not have the capability to mount a whammy bar. Take a look at the bridge of your guitar. The bridge is near the bottom of the body and is where the strings’ ends are held. You should see a small hole, if your guitar is able to hold a whammy bar.Some guitars come with a permanent whammy bar that cannot be removed.;
, If you have a Fender Telecaster or Stratocaster, you’ll be better off letting the music store fit the whammy bar. Many whammy bars look the same, but come in different sizes and fits. Les Paul guitars require you install a tailpiece onto the bridge and body to hold the whammy bar.


The two main types of whammy bars are the detachable ones (Floyd Rose and Fender style) and whammy bars that require a tailpiece (Bigsby).All guitars are different and the method for installing a tailpiece could be different. For example, a Les Paul might look the same as a Gretsch model, but installing a whammy bar is different for the two.

, Make sure you have your whammy bar set up correctly. A whammy bar that is not set up correctly can lead to issues with your bridge. Some whammy bars don’t require to be screwed on to the bridge. For these bars, you simply insert them into the slot and you're ready to rock.


If you have a whammy bar that screws in, make it tight, but not too tight. Some guitarists like their whammy bars looser than others.For tailpiece whammy bars, you’ll need to make sure your bridge and tailpiece are firm. Be careful not to misplace any screws from your bridge, if you install it on your own.
Talk to someone at the music shop before you install a tailpiece. Be sure you purchase the right type of system for your guitar. Music shops won't charge too much for a job like this, and you're guaranteed quality work.

, Study how the whammy bar works by listening to a range of music. This will help you understand what you can do yourself with the whammy bar. You can use whammy in the minimal surf guitar style or the shredding chaos of heavy metal.


There are other types of music that use whammy bars for sound textures and tonal depth like Sonic Youth and My Bloody Valentine."

Connect the power cable of the amp.,
Set up a separate cabinet and head if necessary.,
Plug your guitar into the amp.,
Power the amp on.",How to Use a Guitar Amp1," All guitar and bass amps use the same power cable. Most power cables can be detached from the amp itself. If your cable is detached, plug the female end into the amp. The female side has holes instead of prongs extending outward. Then connect the male end of the cable into a power outlet.To protect your amplifier, use a surge protector. Surge protectors also become useful once you begin to build your tone and experiment with effects pedals.
Be sure the power socket is grounded. A grounded socket means it has three prongs. If you don’t, you risk electrocuting yourself.;
, Many amps you purchase are actually a combination of an amplified and a speaker in one ""box"". These are called ""combo amps"" and are very common. If on the other hand you are working with a separate amplifier component, your setup will require a set of speakers, typically in the form of a cabinet. Run a quarter inch cable from the back of the head into the cab.


A cabinet of speakers (or cab) is a container that holds one or more speakers. The guitar amplified typically powers those speakers.
Most combo amps also allow you the option to use the built-in speaker or to run to a larger speaker cabinet.

, To plug your guitar in, run a quarter-inch (6 mm) audio cable from your guitar's output jack to the input jack on the amp. Always plug into the amp with the amp turned off, and avoid turning the amp on when nothing is plugged in. This can damage the amp’s components.


Some amps may have more than 1 input jack representing different ""channel"" options for you to play out of, for example, channel 1 is clean and channel 2 is more distorted or has reverb., There are two types of amps: solid state amps and tube amps. Solid state amps will have a simple button or flip-switch to power them on. Amps using tube circuitry, however, will often have 2 switches: 1 labeled ""Power"" and another labeled ""Standby."" Turn on both switches for the tube amp to make sound.


Tube amps will take longer to produce sound because it takes a few moments for the tubes to warm up. The standby switch is useful keeping the amplifier warmed up and ready to go during short breaks in playing.
The power is sometimes on the front of the amp and clearly labeled. Sometimes the power switch is located on top of the amp or even behind the amp.
If you’re having trouble locating the power switches on your amp, inspect the front and back of the amp in a well lit area.
If you are playing a gig and load in your equipment on stage before the show, turn on the power switch only. This will make the tubes on your amp warm before showtime. When you’re ready to play, flip on the standby switch.

Pull the strap to tighten the tension on a toggle capo.",How to Use a Guitar Capo1," If you're using tabs or sheet music, you may also notice that it tells you to barre or capo a particular fret. Slide your capo over the desired fret and close it down. It should hold down all six or twelve strings on your guitar and act the same way your index finger acts when using barre chords.

When starting off, it's a good idea to use your capo on the first to third fret, just to get an idea of how it affects your guitar's tone.
Keep in mind how the capo will change the key, tone, and notes that you'll be playing.;
, Tightening your capo in the middle of a fret can cause tension to be distributed unevenly across the neck. This can result in a buzzing or muted sound when trying to play your guitar. To prevent this from happening, make sure to tighten your capo as close to the edge of the fret on the side that's closest to the body of your guitar.

, Screw capos are a popular style of capo that allow the musicians to fine-tune the capo's tension. This is especially useful if your guitar's neck is thick or you have a higher than normal action. While screw capos are accurate, they also have the drawback of taking longer to reposition. This may not be good for a live performance where you'll have to change your capo's position quickly from song to song./images/thumb/5/54/Use-a-Guitar-Capo-Step-3-Version-4.jpg/v4-550px-Use-a-Guitar-Capo-Step-3-Version-4.jpg

, Trigger capos are easy to adjust as you play. These capos rely on resistance to hold your strings down and don't require you to loosen screws or adjust straps. The downfall of trigger capos is that you can't adjust the capo's tension. This could result in a buzzing sound if the capo is too loose or could add unnecessary tension on the neck of your guitar and strings if it's too tight./images/thumb/2/28/Use-a-Guitar-Capo-Step-4-Version-4.jpg/v4-550px-Use-a-Guitar-Capo-Step-4-Version-4.jpg

Trigger capos are often used in live performances because of the speed in which you can move it up and down the neck.

, Toggle capos are small, lightweight capos that are tightened with a strap. Toggle capos are beneficial because of their size and the ability to carry them in your pocket. They are also much cheaper than other capos and can be purchased for under $10. The drawbacks are that toggle capos can break easily and don't always have the most precise tension due to the nature of the strap.

Grab at the balance point as with the American Grip.,
Make your palms parallel to the drum surface.,
Use your middle fingers for support.,
Let your elbows bend out.,
Strike with a wrist motion.",How to Hold a Drumstick2," Today, the American-style grip described above is generally considered the most commonly-used variety matched grip. However, it is far from the only matched grip. For instance, a grip style called German grip is one common variation on the basic American grip that is sometimes used to give the drummer additional power (especially for timpani and bass drums in classical music). To use a German grip, start by finding and gripping the balance point of your sticks exactly as you would above.








, Next, when you have a good grasp on your drumstick, turn your hands so that the flats of your palms are facing the drum surface. Because the vast majority of drums are set up so that the striking surface is roughly level with the floor, this will mean turning your hands so that your palms are facing downward. However, some types of drums, like bass drums, are set up vertically, which means you'll need to turn your palms so that they face sideways.








, Curl your middle fingers underneath the stick so that it rests comfortably on them. Your ring and pinky finger are less important in the German grip than they are in other types of grips — you may use them for solid support if you wish by wrapping them around the stick or simply fold them loosely underneath.








, When you use the German grip, if you're playing on an ordinary drum that's set up horizontally (like most snare drums, tom toms, and so on), your palms will be more or less parallel to the floor. Turning your hand this way has a tendency to make a drummer's elbows bend outward a little — if you notice that this is the case with you, don't feel the need to tuck your elbows in. With the German grip, letting your elbows bend outward can make it easier to get the power and control you'll need to play properly.








, When you're ready to play, hit the drum by turning your wrist downward with a striking motion. The sticks should have a good ""bounce"" when they hit the drum — if they don't, you may need to adjust your grip position up or down the sticks slightly. Keep the striking motion in your wrist. Try to avoid using your arms, shoulders, or fingers.









The German grip is all about power — you shouldn't have a hard time producing loud, ringing hits with this grip, making it great for heavy rock drumming, marching band, and lively classical pieces. However, you may find it a little difficult to control your drumming during quick, intricate passages, making German grip less-suited for jazz drumming, technical rock drumming, and so on.

Grab at the balance point as with the American Grip.,
Face the palms of your hands toward each other.,
Use your middle, ring, and pinky fingers for support.,
Tuck your elbows in.,
Strike with your fingers.",How to Hold a Drumstick3," Another type of matched grip is the French grip. This style is somewhat unique among matched grips in that it mainly uses the fingers to power each drum hit, rather than the wrists. To hold your drumsticks in a French grip, begin exactly as you would for the American or German grip by finding and gripping your sticks' balance points with your thumb and first finger.








, Next, turn your palms inward so that they face each other. The flat parts of your palms should be facing up and down (perpendicular to the floor).









Your palms should be facing each other, but they shouldn't necessarily be close to each other. Keep your hands as far apart as feels natural — for most people,this will be about a foot or so.

, Curl your middle, ring, and pinky fingers underneath each stick. As you play, these fingers will provide support for your sticks, helping you keep them under control. This is extra-important for the French grip because it uses your finger strength more heavily than the other matched grips do.








, Since you've positioned your hands so that their palms are facing each other, your elbows will probably have naturally dropped near to your sides. If they haven't, tuck your elbows in slightly so that they hang an inch or so from your torso.









You don't need to be strict about this — as you play, you should find that your elbows naturally find a comfortable ""resting"" position somewhere near your sides. You just want to avoid having your arms bend outward at the elbows, which can reduce your playing power.

, When you've found a comfortable stance and you're ready to start drumming, turn your wrists downward slightly and use your fingers to strike the drum with the sticks. Some wrist movement will probably be unavoidable, but most of the power for the drum hits should come from using the fingers to strike with the sticks, not from rotating your wrists or moving your forearms or shoulders.









Because you're using your fingers to power your drum hits, French grip typically gives the drummer the ability to play with a little extra control and dexterity than wrist-oriented playing styles. This makes French grip a great choice for drumming that demands finesse, like jazz, technical rock, and certain types of technical ""Drumline""-style pieces. However, because the fingers don't have as much strength as the wrist, French grip can be a bad choice for the loud, powerful drumming demanded by hard rock, heavy metal, and so on.

Use an overhand grip in your other hand.,
Strike with a wrist motion.",How to Hold a Drumstick4," Traditional grip is unique among drum grip styles in that it's not a matched grip — that is, the way you hold the stick isn't the same for both hands. To play with a traditional grip, begin by raising your your non-dominant hand in front of you and turning it so its palm faces upward toward the ceiling.










Note — traditional grip was originally used by military drummers who found it difficult to drum with a matched grip while on the march.To maintain uniformity, the left hand was generally used to hold the stick with an upward-facing grip regardless of which hand was the drummer's dominant one. However, in a modern context, some left-handed drummers reverse the typical traditional grip and use their right hand as the upward-facing one.

, Lay the drumstick in the fleshy ""crook"" of the hand between the thumb and index finger on your non-dominant hand. Slide the drumstick up and down until you find its rough balance point, then line this up so that your hand is supporting the stick roughly at this point.








, Bend your thumb so that it rests comfortably on top of the stick. Then, raise your index finger and lay it over the stick so that the inside portion of the finger is touching the stick. This should feel somewhat less natural than curling your thumb over the stick, but it's important for giving your traditional grip playing solid control.









When gripped properly, the pad of your thumb should be resting on the first knuckle of the index finger (or as near to it as possible) while the index finger should be curved over the top of the stick.

, Bring your middle finger along the outer edge of the stick so that it touches the stick at the underside of the second or third knuckle. This may feel a little unnatural at first, but it shouldn't feel outright uncomfortable.








, Next, bring your ring and pinky finger underneath the stick. Rest the stick on the cuticle of the ring finger or the knuckle of the middle finger and align the little finger under the ring finger for support. When gripped properly, your ring and little finger should be curved roughly the same way as your index finger.









With your index, ring, and pinky fingers curved in somewhat and your middle finger extended, it may look like you're ""giving the bird"". Don't worry! This is OK — in fact, it's a sign of good form.

, Your off hand is ready to play! Now, all you need to do is grip the other stick with your dominant hand in an overhand style just as you would for any of the matched grips above. You can use whichever grip is comfortable for you, but most find the typical American-style grip (or some minor variation on it) to be easiest.








, In traditional grip, you'll want to use a primarily wrist-based motion to do your drum hits, turning your wrists downward to hit the drum. The obvious difference from other styles, of course, is that the upward grip you're using in your off hand requires a slightly different wrist motion than you may be used to. However, you're still turning both hands in the same direction as you normally would.









Traditional grips are often used in jazz drumming and marching band drumming. Because it can be tricky to get the same level of power in your off hand as you would with an overhand grip, this style isn't always a good choice for the kind of loud, heavy drumming you might find in heavy metal, for instance.

Get comfortable with the bar.,
Pull up on the whammy.,
Do the dive.,
Perform the flutter.,
Practice the shriek.,
Use the shoegaze grip.,
Play surf guitar.,
Practice the guitar.",How to Use a Guitar Whammy Bar2," Plug your guitar into an amps and try playing a note. Gently push the whammy bar down. This will drop the pitch of the sound. Practice playing chords and riffs and add the whammy bar.


Depending on what type of guitar you have, your tuning will be affected by heavy use of the whammy bar. Cheaper guitars will go out of tune much faster than higher quality guitars.
Floyd Rose usually comes with tuning locks for the guitar strings. The locks are designed to keep the strings in tune after heavy use of the whammy bar.

, Now try to lift up on the whammy bar, but don't pull too high. Originally, whammy bars were only made to dip the notes. Pulling up on the bar stretches the strings. This raises the pitch instead of lowering the pitch.


You might not be able to do this with tailpiece whammy bars.

, The dive is a classic technique for the whammy bar. Stroke a note or chord on the guitar and press firmly on the bar towards the strings.Famous heavy metal solos begin and end with the dive. As the name suggests, the dive is when the sound of your guitar quickly ‘’dives’’ into a deeper register.


Experiment with using this technique. Try it out during soloing or as an ending to a riff.
Listen to solos by Jimi Hendrix, Eddie Van Halen, and Dimebag Darrell for inspiration.

, The flutter is when you waver the notes of your guitar in a short burst. Practice the flutter by tapping down on the bar and releasing the bar suddenly. Some players prefer to position the whammy bar towards the bottom of the guitar. The flutter is best used on a Floyd Rose whammy bar.


The flutter is a great effect when used sparingly. Try tapping your whammy bar while playing chords or performing a riff.

, The shriek is when you create a shrieking sound out of your guitar by using the whammy bar. You need to play an open harmonic or pinch harmonic.Play an open harmonic by gently touching a string on the fifth, seventh, or twelfth fret. Once you hit the harmonic, pull up on the whammy bar to create a higher pitched shriek.


Never press down fully when playing open harmonics. It is best to position your finger directly over the fret.
A pinch harmonic is when you pick a note and graze the string with your thumb. This technique will take some time to develop. It is easier to do on the middle two strings (D and G). The pitch harmonic creates a higher sounding shriek.

, Shoegazing is a genre developed in the late 80s and early 90s. The name is derived from guitarist who are constantly modifying their tone through pedals and guitar work. From the audience's perspective, they’re looking (or gazing) at their shoes.Hold the whammy bar in your hand and move it to the beat of the song.


The idea is to play chords, but use the whammy bar heavily throughout the chord progression.
Practice synchronizing your strum with the movement of the whammy bar.
This technique isn’t the best for your strings, but the sound is unparalleled.

, Surf guitar is all about using the whammy bar sparsely, unlike shoegaze. Surf guitar is usually centered around a riff or two that is played using tremolo picking (or alternate picking). Tremolo picking is when you play a riff by alternating upward and downward picking at a rapid pace. The whammy bar is best used in surf guitar at the end of a verse or melody.


Listen to classic 50s surf music to hear this technique in practice. Try listening to Dick Dale and Link Wray.

, The best way to improve your whammy bar skills is through practice. Don’t neglect scales and chord shapes because you can use a whammy bar. The best guitarists know their scales and when to properly use the whammy bar. Keep an ear open for the use of whammy bars in music as you begin to develop your own style.

Adjust the volume of your guitar amp.,
Use the volume to effect the tone.,
Adjust the EQ of your guitar's tone.,
Switch between channels if available.,
Use gain on your amp.,
Play with multiple amps.",How to Use a Guitar Amp2," Amps with a simple layout will have a single volume knob. More commonly, you will see 2 knobs, labeled ""Pre"" and ""Post,” or “Drive” and “Master.” The first knob in each of these pairs adjusts the signal before it enters the power amplification stage, while the second knob adjusts the signal after power amplification. Start around 2 on the dial of your master volume.

, The pre or drive knob will have a much more dramatic effect on the overall tone of your guitar. The pre knob allows you to produce a distorted tone. This is because the power amplification stage cannot cleanly handle input signals past a certain level. Turn the ""Pre"" knob higher to achieve a distorted signal.The post or master knob has a less dramatic effect on tone, but handles the overall volume of the amp. The master knob will not affect the distortion of the signal. If the pre knob is set high, set the post knob low to achieve a distorted sound at a reasonable listening volume. If the pre knob is set low, turn the post knob higher to produce a clean tone.

, All guitar amps contain some form of equalization (EQ), often in the form of bass, mid, and high frequencies. Experiment with the EQ on your amp to find a tone you enjoy. The best way to get an idea of the amp’s natural tone is by setting each EQ to “twelve o’clock.”Twelve o’clock means that the knob is set directly in the middle. The term comes from the face of a clock.
Some amps simplify the equalization to a single knob, labeled “tone.” Adjust the knob high to produce a higher frequency to give your guitar a brighter tone.
Move the knob to a lower position to emphasize low frequencies that will produce a warmer, darker tone.

, Some guitar amps will have a button labeled ""Channel."" This button is used to switch between clean and distorted channels, which will provide you with a quick way to increase the level of distortion. Pressing this button has the same effect as turning up the pre-gain knob and turning down the post-gain knob.


Some guitar amps come with a pedal to switch between channels on the fly., The gain knob on your amp is designed to increase the distortion of your guitar's sound. In effect, the gain knob also increases the volume. Not all guitar amps come with gain settings. Some guitarists value this effect so much that they purchase several pedals that produce this sound like, overdrive and distortion effects pedals.Gain is particularly useful if you play rock or blues music.
Some players like to increase the gain on the amp right before a guitar solo.

, Before settling on an amp, you should visit a music store and try out multiple amps. Each model and brand has an unique sound that is worth being experimented with. You'll see difference in the ""American sound"" with brands like Fender, and the ""U.K. sound"" with brands like Marshall and Vox.


Some guitarists even prefer to play out of a bass amp.
Determine if you like the tube sound over solid state amps or vice versa - tubes tend to give a more classic, warm tone to your playing but require additional maintenance and care.

"
"
Experiment with other controls on your guitar amp.,
Use additional pedals.,
Upgrade your amplifier.",How to Use a Guitar Amp3," Many amps contain additional controls, such as ones for special effects like chorus, tremolo, delay, and reverb. Note, however, that you can often achieve a higher quality tone by using effects pedals to produce these effects.


The most common effect to come equipped with an amp is reverb. The reverb effect produces a larger sound by simulating the sound wave bouncing off multiple surfaces.The reverb effect is subtle but powerful, and it can be used for a wide array of sounds.

, The world of guitar pedals (also called effects pedals, or stomp boxes) is nearly endless. The most versatile pedals are delay, distortion, and compression. Effect pedals range from about $30 to around $1,000. Effects pedals are typically powered by a 9V battery and must go in between your guitar and your amplifier in the chain. Plug your guitar into one end (the input) and your amp into the other end (the output), then use your foot to activate the effect while playing.


Search online for a better idea of what effects and amplifier settings your favorite recordings are using.
Classic/hard rock uses distortion/overdrive, flanger or phase, wah-wah, and delay.
Blues guitar uses a variety of overdrives and amp simulator pedals.
Country guitar utilizes tremolo and reverb.
Shoegaze uses almost every pedal you can imagine but especially utilizes reverb, distortion, fuzz, delay, chorus, and tremolo.

, Once you get an understanding of your guitar needs you can invest in an amp that suits you. If you are playing out of a small practice amp, the best upgrade you should consider is a combo tube amp. For tube combo amps, you can usually get away with a single 12” speaker, but many prefer the louder cousin, two 12” speakers.


Classic tube combo amps are made by Marshall, Fender, and Vox.
You can also upgrade to a stack which consists of a guitar (or bass) head and a cabinet of two to four speakers.

, Before you start using a capo, make sure that you have the fundamental chord shapes down. Learn how to play the basic open chords like E minor and C before moving onto more complex open chords like D minor and G.If you're already proficient at playing open chord progressions, then having a capo will increase your guitar versatility and you'll be able to make the transition much easier.

Search for chord maps online or at a music store if you are having trouble playing a specific chord.

, If you are playing in a group, you'll all want to play in the same key so that your music sounds cohesive. There are seven chords for each key, and they correspond with the seven chords in each key scale. The capo position will change the chords you are playing, thus altering the key that you're playing in. Move your capo up and down the neck to change the key that you're comfortable playing in.


The progression of chords within a scale takes the pattern of major, minor, minor, major, major, and diminished.

Using this pattern, you can see that the chords in the key of C are, C major, D minor, E minor, F major, G major, and A diminished.



, Using a capo further down on your neck will brighten the tone of your guitar and make it easier to write happy or upbeat music. Other than helping match your vocal registry, use the capo to make your open chords sound happier. Experiment with different positions further down the neck and see what kind of sounds you can create.

, Look online for a transposition chart for guitars with capos. These charts will tell you exactly which chord you're playing depending on where your capo is positioned.Take some existing music you already know how to play and place the capo on a fret. Once you're done with that, correspond which chord shapes you need to use to match the chords you'd normally play without a capo.

, When you use a capo, you can use the same open chord shapes or forms, but the chord notes will be different depending on where you placed the capo. Much like a barre chord, the capo holds down all the strings on a particular fret. This means that the same chord shapes that you're used to playing in the open chord position will now emit different tones with the same finger positioning on the guitar's neck.

Moving your capo up one fret will move your chord up a half step or half-tone, while moving the capo up on the guitar's neck for two frets will move it up a full step or tone.
For example, a C form played with a capo on the first fret has now become a C#. The G chord form played with a capo on the first fret turns into a G#, moving the chord up one half-step.
When moving the capo up to the second fret, your C form has now become a D and your G becomes an A, moving your chord up a full step.

Determine which type of capo you want.,
Compare prices for capos online.,
Order your capo online or purchase one at a music store.",How to Use a Guitar Capo3," There are a multitude of different capos that you can purchase online or at most music stores. Ask to try different capos at a music store to see which one you like the best. Determine if you'll be using the capo for live performances, or if you're just going to use it at home.


If you're just using the capo at home during practice, a screw capo is the most durable and precise capo that you can get.
If you're using the capo during live performances, consider using a trigger capo because of how quickly can you adjust it on the neck.

, Capos range in price. Determine how much money your willing to spend on this accessory before going over your options. If you're a new guitar player or have never used a capo in the past, you may want to go with a cheaper version, to see if you like using one. If you are a veteran guitar player and know that you enjoy using one, opt to go with a higher-quality capo.


The average cost of a guitar capo is anywhere between $4 to $30 depending on the style and quality., Once you determine the capo that you want, go to an online music store or visit a physical location near you. Visiting the physical location could be beneficial because often they will allow you to test your equipment there. This could be especially valuable if you've never used a capo before.


Popular capo brands include Shubb, Neewer, Live for Music, and Jim Dunlop.Popular music stores include Sam Ash, Guitar Center, Truetone Music, and Dream Guitars."

Adjust each knob in turn to determine how it affects your tone.,
Make quick changes between modulated and unmodulated signals.",How to Use a Guitar Pedal," Effects pedals are perhaps the most infinitely customizable aspect of playing electric guitar. Pedals are available that produce just about any type of tone or special effect imaginable. If you are new to guitar pedals, consider buying one of the most popular types: a distortion pedal. This type of pedal will allow you to switch between clean and distorted tones using only your foot.;
, Nearly all guitar pedals give you 2 options for power. The most portable solution is to fit them with a 9-volt battery. To avoid the inconvenience of replacing batteries, you can plug the pedal in using its included AC adapter, but note that this can quickly create a mess of cables if you are using multiple pedals.

, To insert the guitar pedal into the signal path, run a quarter-inch (6 mm) cable from your guitar to the input jack on the pedal. Then, run a cable from the output jack on the pedal to your amp's input jack. Most guitar pedals are designed to consume power any time they have something connected to their input jack, so when you finish playing, disconnect the cable to conserve battery life.

, The amp should only be turned on after all the cables have been connected. Doing otherwise can cause damage to the amp's circuitry.

, Begin by setting the pedal's knobs to the positions that will affect the tone the least. For most pedals, this will mean setting the knobs at 0 or at unity, meaning halfway between 0 and 10. Engage the pedal by pressing the foot switch with your foot.

, Begin playing your guitar, and experiment with each of the pedal's knobs. The function of each knob will be labeled, and a detailed description of what it does can be found in the pedal's owner's manual. However, the best way to get to know your guitar pedal is by adjusting the knobs yourself and playing your guitar to see what kind of tone is generated.

, Once you have set the knobs to produce a desirable effect, you can make quick changes between your guitar's tone by pressing the foot switch. In fact, this is the entire purpose of guitar pedals - to allow you to make quick changes without needing a spare hand. An example application of this technique would be using a clean tone during a song's verse, and engaging a distortion pedal during the chorus.

Make sure you need to remove the tube.,
Unplug the amplifier and let it rest.,
Remove the back panel of the amplifier.,
Locate the tube you want to remove.,
Remove the metal tube cover if applicable.,
Remove the vacuum tube.,
Replace the tube.",How to Remove a Tube from a Tube Amp," Tubes can be expensive, so before replacing them you should assess whether they need to be replaced. If the tube is burnt-out and will not glow when the amp is powered on, then replacement is necessary. If the amp has begun sounding excessively muddled, produces hissing or squealing noises, or demonstrates unpredictable fluctuations in volume, the tubes are probably worn and should be replaced. With average playing time at average volume levels, tubes should be replaced about once a year.;
, Before attempting any work on the amp, unplug it. Leave the speakers connected to the amp with the power switch on for a few seconds to help drain any remaining voltage from the amp. Before working on the amp, give it at least 10 minutes to ensure the tubes have fully cooled.

, In many amps, you will need to remove a plastic or metal panel from the rear of the chassis. This is usually done with a Phillips head screwdriver. Set the panel aside after removing it.

, If the tubes have not been replaced in a while, consider replacing all the tubes at once. If a single tube is burnt-out, you can power on the amp and watch to see which tube does not glow. Make sure to let any tubes cool before touching them.

, Some tubes may be covered by a metal cylinder. Grab the cylinder and twist it to unthread it and remove it. Set it aside.

, Tubes are seated using a 9-pin connection, with the male pins extending from the bottom of the tube and the female receptors located in the socket. To remove the tube, gently grab it and work it slightly back and forth while lifting upwards. Be gentle to avoid bending or breaking the pins. Do not twist the tube while lifting.

, If replacing the tube, insert the new tube using the same motion as you used to remove the old one. Lower it gently down, working it slightly back and forth to seat it fully. Discard the old tube. Replace the metal cover if applicable and replace the rear panel.

Know your playing style.,
Gauge the right thickness.,
Think about the shape of the pick.",How to Make Guitar Picks From Cardboard1," Picks are made in numerous shapes and sizes in order give guitar players a wide range of sounds to experiment with. You need to have an idea of what your playing style is like or what sound you're trying to create before deciding on a pick. For example, do you like to solo quickly? Do you primarily play simple chords? Do you like hard, staccato attacks or warm, open sounds? These are questions you need to consider before creating your pick.;
, Guitar picks come in varying degrees of thickness that affect the attack, tone, and ease of playing. It's important to decide what thickness would work best for your cardboard pick in order to achieve the specific sound you're looking for.


Somewhere between .40 and .60 millimeters is a standard thickness for obtaining a treble-heavy tone that favors acoustic strumming patterns.
If you're playing lead or rhythm guitar then you should consider a pick of medium thickness, from .60 to .80 millimeters. Thin picks don't work for single note tones as their slim build doesn't create much bass or midrange sounds. A pick of medium thickness is the most popular option as they offer flexibility and a level of stiffness necessary for accompaniment or lead soloing.
For thick, heavy sounds you need a truly thick pick, usually over 1.5mm. This weight is ideal for both jazz and metal guitar players as it summons a warm, full-bodied sound from the guitar. For those seeking a bass-heavy sound even consider a pick as thick as 3 mm. , While it may seem like an insignificant detail, the shape of a guitar pick complements different techniques and playing styles. Think about the way you enjoy playing the guitar and then try and find a pick that matches your preferred technique. Smaller, teardrop-shaped picks with pointed tips are favorites of those who need more control, precision, and articulation of lines made up of single notes. These picks work well for players who enjoy shredding and playing single notes in fast succession.
Picks shaped like equilateral triangles are a favorite of those who constantly have picks falling out of their hands during fast strums. The triangle-shaped pick is designed to rest firmly between your fingers while allowing you the control for fast soloing.
There are some picks with multiple edges that allow you to quickly switch between thin, medium, and thick gauges. This special type of pick will be hard to replicate accurately on cardboard, but it could be worth a try for the adventurous. "

Pick your slide.,
Choose which finger to put the slide on.,
Use the right guitar.,
Tune your guitar for sliding.",How to Use a Guitar Slide1," There are many different slides you can choose from. Many musicians make slides out of common every day objects, such as glass bottle tops, metal piping, or glass medicine bottles.The easier option for those just starting to use a guitar slide is to buy a new one from a music store. The two most common types are glass and metal slides.


Glass slides are typically lighter and create a airy, sharp sound. Metal slides produce a deeper, warmer, and louder tone but are heavier on your finger.
Different slides will sounds different on specific guitars, Before you commit to a slide, test it on your guitar to make sure it creates the sound you want.;
, There are three fingers you can wear your slide on, your middle, ring, or pinky finger. The finger you choose will vary the sound you get from the slide as well as the mobility of your remaining fingers.


Your middle finger will need a larger slide since your middle finger is bigger than your others. Using this finger will produce a hearty tone, but you will not be able to use your other fingers to play notes or mute the strings. This means that you will only be able to produce the slide sound.
Your ring (or fourth) finger will need a smaller slide than the one for your middle finger. This slide covers the whole fretboard and helps produce a full sound. You can mute the other keys with your index and middle fingers, which allows you to play normal notes as well.
Your pinky finger will need a much smaller slide than your other fingers. Your finger will not cover the whole fretboard, but your can use your other three fingers to play normal notes and mute the strings while you play., The best guitar to use for sliding is one with higher action. This means you need to find a guitar that has more room between the fretboard and the strings. If you converting one of your guitars to use for sliding, you can leave your guitar's action high. If you are switching back and forth between sliding and normal playing, you should adjust your action to a higher setting before you try to slide.


This prevents extra noise reverberation between the strings and the fretboard as you slide.
If you are using an electric guitar (which typically has low action), you will have better luck with a glass slide., For sliding, you should have open tuning on your guitar. This means that the open string notes should belong to major chords. This kind of tuning makes it great for accompanying other instruments.


Some common open tunings are D-G-D-G-B-D, E-B-E-G#-B-E, and D-A-D-F#-A-D.If open tuning is unfamiliar to you, you can use a regular tuned guitar. You just may not be able to get the same kind of sound out of your guitar from sliding.
You can use online resources to help you open tune your guitar. You can also ask someone else to help you get it tuned correctly."

Strengthen the pick's durability.",How to Make Guitar Picks From Cardboard2," Most of the materials are common household items that anyone can cobble together in a pinch. Be sure to take time finding fresh, high quality cardboard without any wear and tear.


1 or 2 thin sheets of cardboard, ideally 0.70mm or lower. Make sure the cardboard is adequately stiff so it won't bend when strumming the guitar. Grab an acoustic guitar pick the same size of the pick you're trying to create. Make sure this pick matches the shape and thickness you're looking for. This pick will serve as the reference for your homemade pick.You need a pen, pencil, or thick sharpie so you can outline the acoustic guitar pick on the cardboard.
Get some basic scotch tape to cover your cardboard guitar pick once it's complete.
A millimeter ruler is necessary to measure the precise thickness of the cardboard.
Scissors are crucial as you need to cut the pick out of the cardboard.

, Using your millimeter ruler or your pick, carefully find out the exact thickness of the cardboard. Traditional cardboard or paperboard is around 0.25mm wide. Tape another layer of cardboard atop of the original if you'd prefer a thicker guitar pick.

, Take your writing utensil and trace the shape of the pick onto the cardboard. Remember to take this step slowly and carefully to ensure you're tracing the exact shape of the guitar pick.

, Cut very cautiously around the outline of the pick you traced onto the cardboard. Delicately navigate the scissors along the outline in order to capture the shape of the pick.

, Put the real pick on top of your homemade pick and see if they match up. Ideally there should be no overlap between the cardboard and the actual pick.


Check to see if there are any uneven edges on your cardboard pick. Carefully cut off any excess cardboard but be careful not to cut off more than necessary.
Try out the cardboard pick and see how it feels. Make sure to play it at as hard or fast as you would with an actual pick in order to assess the durability of your homemade pick in a live setting.
Compare and contrast the way both picks sound on the guitar. Pay attention to the subtle differences in tone when the picks hit the strings. Make the necessary adjustments if the cardboard pick still isn't getting the sound you desire.

, Your pick may bend too easily while playing, so make sure you take extra steps to reinforce it if necessary. Try putting scotch tape over your cardboard pick to prevent bending. Experiment with different layers of cardboard and tape to obtain the right thickness.

Just remember, the texture and quality will obviously be different based on what materials you apply to the pick. Don't overdo it or the design may trump the pick's practical uses.

, Everyone has their own brand loyalty for a specific guitar company, whether it's Dunlop, Gibson, or Fender. Look up the logo of your favorite brand and carefully duplicate it onto your homemade pick to showcase your style., For those who are especially inventive, try making a guitar brand all of your own. Test out different fonts and lettering to formulate a specific look. Don't be afraid to be unique, but remember not to draw too much and risk compromising the utility of your pick.

Mute the strings above your slide.,
Press the slide directly above a fret.,
Slide into the notes.,
Use gentle pressure.,
Mute the strings between notes.",How to Use a Guitar Slide2," In order for you to make the right sounds with your slide, you need to learn to mute the strings above where your sliding. This will keep the strings from unwanted vibrations and keep them from producing unwanted sounds.


To do this, gently press your fingers on the strings. Use just enough pressure to keep the strings from making unnecessary noises as they vibrate., To play your slide correctly, you need to make sure you are pressing it in the right place. You should not press the string under or above the fret because the note will sound flat.


You should also not press the string into the fretboard.
Even if your eyes say that you are directly above the fret, listen to the note. If it sounds flat or wrong in any way, move your slide up and down until it makes the right note., To start learning to slide, pick a note on your guitar. Muting the other strings with your non-slide fingers, press gently with the slide and then move it up and down the strings to make the sliding sound. You can start slow to get a feel for the different technique of playing and motions needed to play with the slide on.


If you are using the slide on your middle finger, you will not be able to mute the strings. Just apply gently enough to get the sound you want.
Try playing songs you are familiar with using your slide to get used to the different feel of the technique., When you use a slide, you should not press too hard on the strings. This will make the strings touch the fretboard, which will cause your guitar to make strange, unpleasant sounds. Move your hand up and down to gauge how hard you are pressing. If it's hard to move the slide, you should lighten your pressure. The more you move your hand around, the better feel you will have for the strings.

, As you play note after note, the strings will continue to reverberate. If you slide up the string to your next note, all the notes in between will play as well. To avoid this, mute the strings between different notes using your other hand.


You can use the finger that you are picking with or the heel of your hand to help mute the strings.
Sliding between the notes is part of the slide sound. However, if you slide between the notes you play, the sound can get overwhelming or redundant.
Practice different songs to decide when to slide and when you should mute the strings."
"
Try out different sounds.,
Keep your slide parallel to the frets.,
Shift your hand on higher strings.",How to Use a Guitar Slide3," There are different sounds you can make while using a slide. You can try different sliding techniques to create different slide sounds by starting in different places, playing different notes, or changing hand speeds.


For example, if you want a bluesy sound, start below the fret and slid up to the fret.This may be uncomfortable because you are conditioned to aim just under the fret.
You can also use vibrato to get a different kind of sound from sliding. However, don’t try to move the string up and down as you would with normal vibrato because this won't work with the slide on. Instead, get the same effect by moving the slide back and forth slightly., In order for the slide technique to sound right, your slide should be directly parallel to the frets as you play. Think about the slide as a replacement for the fret on your guitar.


There are advanced sliding techniques where you can learn to angle your slide. However, when you are beginning, keep it centered directly above the fret until you are completely comfortable., There are certain notes you will play that will cause your hand positioning to change. For instance, if you are playing notes on the higher two strings, shift the slide up off the bottom strings so it only hits the top strings. If it hits the lower strings, it may cause clatters and bumps that you don’t want, even if you are muting those strings.


When you play the lower strings, the slide will be on all the strings. Just be sure to mute the higher strings very well with your index finger."

1 Know the string numbers on your guitar.,
Know the notes of a guitar well before attempting to incorporate this scale into your playing.,
Minor scales come in three main varieties, the natural minor, melodic minor and harmonic minor.,
Notice these two scales share the same patterns it's important to think of them separately, so take note of the root notes.",How to Play a Natural Harmonic Minor Scale on Guitar," The thinnest string on your guitar (the high E) is string #1. The thickest string (the low E) is the 6th string on your guitar. This is important to know as tablature often refers to positions on the guitar relative to string numbers.;
, The strings correspond to names of notes and are as follows; The first string is E, the 2nd is B, 3rd is G, 4th is D, 5th is A, and the 6th is E again.

, This scale shares the same notes as it's relative major counterpart, so for example, C major and A natural minor share the same notes.

Place the fleshy side of your palm lightly on the strings.,
Keeping your palm down on the strings, strum normally.,
Adjust the pressure of your palm to adjust your sound.,
Experiment with hand position.,
Adjust your hands to sound certain notes.",How to Palm Mute1," Pretend your karate-chopping the strings. Don't actually hit them, but that shows you what part of your hand should be hitting the strings. It should be the outside of your palm.When you first put your hand down, it should be perpendicular to the strings, not laying flat against them.
Slide the hand back as close to the bridge as you can-- this makes it easier to learn.;
, Use your fingers and light wrist movement to strum while still keeping everything muted. You want to work on keeping the same weight on the strings as you strum, moving only up and down, not against the strings, as you pick.









It is often easiest to start by just picking one string. As you get used to keeping it palm muted, play a two-string chord, then a three, and onward.

, A lot of palm muting is about the feel on the strings, since the actual skill is not very hard. The harder you press, the less you'll hear the note of the string and more you'll hear a dampened, percussive sound. If you are too light you'll just hear buzzing as the strings struggle to move. The perfect sound is a deadened, but still melodic, note that ends quickly after you strum it.








With dampening, you should be able to hear the pitch when you pick the string. Try picking the strings one at time to make sure you can hear all the proper pitches rather than a dead plucking sound., You can change how much your hand dampens the sound by moving it back and forth on the strings. Moving closer to the fretboard dampens the sound more.








However, as noted, you should keep your hand as close to the bridge as possible if you still want to hear pitch.

, If you want the first string to sound, lift off that part of your hand. You can test to make sure it's sounding correctly by strumming it. Practice lifting off each string in order. Once you've mastered the technique, you can control which strings are dampened and which strings are not.








You'll be lifting from your wrist, rather than from your fingers. You can curl your wrist up and down to open up or mute certain strings with some practice.

Decide on how much money are willing to spend for your guitar.,
Think about what type of guitar do you want - acoustic or electric.,
Pick your style.,
Try out as much different guitars as you can.,
Visit a lot of music/guitar shops.,
Enjoy it!",How to Pick a Good Guitar," If you're a beginner, there is no point in buying something expensive. 200-300$ are enough.;
, If it's your first guitar, then better pick an acoustic.

, For example, if you want to play metal, Ibanez, Jackson or BC Rich are pretty popular, but Fender Stratocaster is not a very good choice, because it has a single coil pickup. Instead of that it's actually awesome for rock, funk or jazz! Think about what do you want that guitar to sound like, if you imagine it with lots of distortion, for example, then you should consider getting an amp or better, an effect pedal.

, Research on the internet, read reviews, if you know other guitarists, ask them how do they feel about the guitars they've tried, or in other words, get information about it! The more you know, the better!

, Now that sort of got the picture of what do you want your guitar to be like, go to the shop, or better, visit many different shops, don't give up and spend your money before you find what you're looking for. When you find a guitar that fits the looks and features part, try it out. Make some taping, thrilling, try some tremolo picking and the whole time listen carefully to the sound and watch out for buzzing and unclean sounds. You can play a couple of scales or something like that, just to check if it's comfortable to play it, for example the griff may be too thick for your hand, or too thin, it might be hard playing fast on it, or simply not fitting you, but this is important, if you don't feel comfortable to play it, then better don't buy that guitar. Try to decide how heavy the guitar is, if it's too light, then the wood is not good, and this is a very important factor, especially for acoustics. If it's too heavy, then it's not a good idea buying that one too. It has to be the right weight for you, the most important is for you to be comfortable playing.

, You have to feel exited about that guitar, you have to love it, what's the point in buying a guitar you wouldn't enjoy? You should be sure you really want that guitar before buying, or you'll most likely regret it after a while.

Tune into the bridge pickups of your electric guitar.,
Use humbucker pickups whenever possible.,
Work on moving in and out of palm muting mid strum.",How to Palm Mute2," Since you're picking and muting near the bridge, these pickups will get the best, thickest sound for you.









For a more distorted, buzzy sound, use the neck pickups.

, These pickups will grab a lot of that deep, chunky tone that you want when palm muting.








, Listen to old Green Day tracks, for example. They are simple chords and structures, but the ability to go quickly from palm muted to open strings allows him to texture and layer the guitar part uniquely.









Learn to start palm muting, then slowly raising your palm off. Become your guitars volume knob, switching fluidly.

Master a metronome-perfect sense of rhythm.,
Learn the bluegrass standards.,
Keep both hands loose and relaxed, especially in speedy sections.,
Play with pick placement to get different tones and attacks on the strings.,
Take short, precise strums instead of using big and expansive motions.,
Build up your playing speed slowly, deliberately, and smoothly.",How to Play Bluegrass Guitar1," Most of your time on the guitar is going to be spent playing rhythm sections, not soloing, and an one-the-money sense of rhythm is what distinguishes a great bluegrass guitarist from a beginner. Whenever you practice, you should be using a metronome the majority of the time.


Set the metronome to a speed where you can play everything perfectly, slowly raising the tempo from there. You want to play smoothly at any speed -- not quickly by sloppily.
Bluegrass gains power and drive when every single instrument is locked into the same rhythm. It quickly sounds sloppy when some people are too fast or are lagging behind.;
, Most bluegrass guitar is played communally with other guitarists, banjoist, mandolins, etc, and the only way these circles work is if everyone knows the same songs. Don't be afraid to ask other musicians for suggestions, too. Pick up these classics and master them first to start playing with other musicians and build your repertoire:


""Salt Creek""
""Fireball Mail""
""Old Joe Clark""
""Whiskey Before Breakfast""
""Angeline the Baker."", You want a light touch on the strings, using as little pressure as possible to let the note ring out. Many players tense up when trying to play fast, which binds their muscles and prevents fluidity and speed. Don't worry if your touch feels ""heavy"" right now. Make it a point to loosen up on the guitar and you'll slowly start to feel faster and smoother.


A good tip is to keep your fingers close to the fretboard, even when not playing a note. This cuts down on the speed and force you need to land on a note., Most players start with their pick perfectly parallel to the strings, as this is the easiest way to get solid contact. Bluegrass players, however, use a wide variety of picking textures to get more rhythmic aspects into their play. As a right-handed player, rotate your hand clockwise a few degrees to hit the strings more on the edge of the pick, which should be sharper and more percussive. If you pick with the left hand, turn counter-clockwise., Bluegrass is not the place to whip out your Pete Townsend impression with big, windmilling strums. You want a short, powerful swing with your strumming hand. Think of driving your pick through the strings instead of over top them.


This is a place your pick placement can help get a louder tone with a shorter strum. The harsher the angle, the louder the chord., Bluegrass is a very fast genre of music, almost never dropping below 200 beats per minute (BPM). This means playing fast isn't just nice, it's a requirement. In order to play quickly, however, you need some patience. All the speed in the world doesn't matter if you can't hit the notes cleanly.


Practice at a speed just above your comfort level, and don't increase the speed until you can hit this tempo cleanly every time.
Again, the use of a metronome cannot be understated -- it is necessary for consistent rhythm."
"
Learn as many of the open chords and chord shapes as you can.,
Learn the ""boom & chick"" pattern most common in bluegrass rhythm guitar.,
Lay additional emphasis on the second and forth beats to really swing.,
Use ""bass runs"" to add little licks of flavor between chords.,
Provide a rock-solid perfect rhythmic backing before moving on to lead play.",How to Play Bluegrass Guitar2," Open chords are those that utilize unfretted, or ""open,"" notes when played. They are far and away the most common chords in bluegrass, as open notes will keep ringing out after being played, which creates wonderful sustain and lasting melody. If you're just starting, the essentials are C, G, and D, which can form hundreds of songs on their own:



C-Chord | G-Chord | D-Chord |
|e|----x-----|------3------|-----2------|
|B|----1----|------3------|-----3------|
|G|----0----|------0------|-----2------|
|D|----2----|------0------|-----0------|
|A|----3----|------2------|-----x------|
|E|----x----|------3------|-----x------|, This is the classic and most essential bluegrass rhythm, and can be played on any chord. Start with an open G, fingering it like normal, and count out a basic ""1, 2, 3, 4 / 1, 2, 3, 4/ etc."" rhythm, using a metronome to help keep time.Beat 1: Pluck the root note, in this case the 6th string, 3rd fret.
Beat 2: Strum the bottom 3-4 strings of the cord, coming up with the pick.
Beat 3: Pluck 4th string note of the chord, in this case the open D string.
Beat 4: Strum the bottom 3-4 strings of the chord, coming up with the pick., This means, if playing your basic ""boom-chick,"" you're leaning a little harder on the strummed notes than the chords. This provides a regular rhythmic backbone to the song, not unlike the ""lub-DUB"" of your heartbeat. Other instruments, in general, will fill the other spaces in the rhythm with their own emphasis.


This frequently means emphasizing your upstroke while picking. A solid, strong upstroke will usually give a song a swinging feel.
Remember that musical tension is created through contrast. By keeping beats 1 & 3 relaxed, you get a little added power in beats 2 & 4., A bass run is simply a set of single notes, played on the heavier strings, that you use to transition from one chord or song section to the other. You can look up thousands of them online, but the basic strategy is to just ""walk"" from the bass note of one chord to the bass note of the other chord, playing some of the frets in between to get there. One simple example of a ""G-run"" would be like this -- starting with the classic ""boom-chick"" on a G chord and moving to C with a few solo notes. The ""run"" is in the 4th & 5th bar:


|e|-------3---|-------3----|------3------|------------|--------0----|
|B|------3---|-------3-----|-----3------|-------------|-------1-----|
|G|------0---|-------0----|------0------|------------|--------0----|
|D|-----------|-0----------|-------------|-------------|-------2-----|
|A|-----------|-------------|-------------|---0--2----|--3----------|
|E|--3-------|-------------|--3---------|-------------|-------------|, Before taking any bass runs or fine-tuning your pick position, you must have perfect rhythm. The guitar, with it's big, rich sound and natural volume, often takes the duty of a drummer in a bluegrass circle. As the guitarist, your job is to keep everyone on time. None of your technical flash matters if you can't hold down the tempo.


This is why you must practice with a metronome. It is the only way to train and ensure perfect rhythm each time."
"
Use the notes from your chords to build your basic lead lines.,
Use pull-offs to pluck open strings without having to pick.,
Use hammer-ons to quickly blaze up the fretboard.,
Use open notes whenever you're in doubt, especially with pull-offs.,
Use repeated notes instead of trying to dance around the fretboard with fast songs.,
Use the major and minor pentatonic scales to start working your way down the neck.",How to Play Bluegrass Guitar3," Because bluegrass guitarists must be able to quickly transition from lead lines to rhythmic playing, as evidenced briefly in the bass runs above, they tend to use similar sets of notes to make speedy play much easier. Use the notes from each chord currently being played to form your licks and solos. For example, the following lick in the key of C only uses those open notes and notes already in a C chord:


|e|----------------------------------------------------|
|B|------------------------------0---1---------------|
|G|---------------------0--2-------------------------|
|D|---------0--1--2---------------------------------|
|A|----3----------------------------------------------|
|E|----------------------------------------------------|, Instead of gently removing your finger from the fret, pull it downward, sounding out the string like your finger was a pick. Because bluegrass relies so much on open strings, this is a great way to quickly ring them out while picking other notes, effectively doubling your playing speed. Check out this simple run from a C to a G to see it in action -- the ""p"" means to pull off the first note into the second:


|e|---------------------3---|
|B|--------------------3--|
|G|--------------------0---|
|D|-------------------------|
|A|----3p2p0-------------|
|E|---------------3---------|

, A hammer on is when you slam your finger down on the fret so that it sounds out without picking. They are a great way to add subtle notes to your lead lines and solos and increase note speed. They also pair excellently with pull-offs, which can allow you to play three notes with only one strum. The ""h"" means you hammer onto the fret immediately after the ""h"":


|e|---------------------0----|
|B|--------------------1----|
|G|--------------------0----|
|D|----0h2p0--------2----|
|A|---------------3----------|
|E|--------------------------|

, A great way to increase your picking speed is to pick notes with your fretting hand. Hammer-ons and pull-offs are essential for bluegrass play, as they add speed and texture only possible with open notes, so don't be afraid to just start plucking and pulling off your chords to transition in and out of solos or create a little extra rhythm to your solos.

, For beginners, playing a lead line at a blistering 240BPM is a recipe for crashing and burning. A good way to get up to that pace is not to play as many different notes as you can, but to focus on playing a few notes well. You can keep your picking hand moving while keeping things simple on the fretboard, allowing you to play blazing fast lines with less effort. Try doubling or tripling up notes before you move, giving you a bit more time to think.


As you get better, you'll be able to start picking and fretting at faster and faster speeds -- just remember that it doesn't matter how fast a solo is if it sounds sloppy.

, Most solos, as evidenced above, tend to stick to the top of the guitar. But if you're really serious about lead guitar then you already want to stretch further down the neck into new territory. Luckily, the most common guitar scales -- the major and minor pentatonic scale -- will work wonders.A common, but difficult, skill is to change the scale to match the chord being played. So, for an A chord, you play the A-major pentatonic, then move to the C-major when switching to the C chord. This requires in-depth knowledge of every note on the fretboard.

If you're serious about bluegrass guitar, you must spend time learning the music theory behind the CAGED system, which helps map the fretboard.Still feel like stretching your musical muscles? Dive into the mixlodian mode for bluegrass solos as well."

Pay attention to the underlying chord sequence.",How to Play a Guitar Solo," These techniques are simple enough by themselves, but mastering them and being able to effortlessly integrate them is crucial to be able to solo well. Some of these techniques include bends, hammer-ons, pull-offs, vibrato, and double stops.
/images/thumb/b/b9/Play-a-Guitar-Solo-Step-1-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Play-a-Guitar-Solo-Step-1-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/b/b9/Play-a-Guitar-Solo-Step-1-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Play-a-Guitar-Solo-Step-1-Version-2.jpg









A bend is accomplished by bending a guitar string to raise its pitch. To play a bend, fret a string with your ring finger, and place your pointer and middle fingers on the frets just behind it. Exerting pressure with all 3 fingers, push the string up or down against the neck and allow its pitch to rise. You can achieve either a half step or a full step difference in pitch.
A hammer-on is accomplished by playing a second note with only your fretting hand. To play a hammer-on, fret a string with your pointer finger and pluck the string. After plucking the string, forcefully fret the note a full step above this note with your ring finger, but do not pluck the string.
A pull-off is the analog to the hammer-on. To play a pull-off, fret a string with your ring finger and pluck the string. After plucking the string, pull your ring finger off the fretboard, keeping your index finger fretted a full step below. Pull-offs and hammer-ons can be used to increase your solo's speed, because you don't need to pluck each note separately.
A vibrato occurs when a sustained note is allowed to pulsate in pitch. To play a vibrato, fret a string with your pointer finger and pluck the note. Allow the note to ring, all the while jiggling your pointer finger back and forth on the fretboard. This will cause the note to pulsate regularly between being in tune and slightly sharp.
A double stop occurs when you play 2 notes at the same time during a solo. Simply put, a double stop is a chord. Fret and pluck both strings just as you would when playing a chord sequence.;
, The pentatonic scale is a scale with only 5 notes per octave, in contrast to the typical 7 notes. Removing the 2 notes from the diatonic scale creates a scale with no dissonant intervals (there are no minor seconds or diminished fifths), and as such the pentatonic scale has become the quintessential scale for guitar soloing. You will want to become familiar with the scale at all positions along the guitar's neck.

/images/thumb/5/50/Play-a-Guitar-Solo-Step-2-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Play-a-Guitar-Solo-Step-2-Version-3.jpg









The major pentatonic scale is produced by playing the first, second, third, fifth, and sixth degrees of the major scale. In C major, the pentatonic scale would be: C, D, E, G, A.
The minor pentatonic scale is produced by playing the first, third, fourth, fifth, and seventh degrees of the minor scale. In C minor, the pentatonic scale would be: C, E-flat, F, G, B-flat. The pentatonic scale that you use as a framework for your solo should match the key of the song.
The minor blues pentatonic scale is produced by playing the first, third, fourth, flatted fifth, and seventh degrees of the blues minor scale. In C minor, the pentatonic scale would be: C, E-flat, F, G-flat, G, B-flat.

, Play up and down the pentatonic scale, employing techniques like bends and hammer-ons. This provides the basic framework for guitar soloing in virtually all styles of music.

, As you begin to play through the pentatonic scale using various techniques, make sure to vary your rhythmic structures. Strive for a balance between fast, technically precise passages (using sixteenth-notes for example) and slow, lyrically expressive passages (using half or whole notes, for example).

, As you become comfortable with soloing, start to pay more attention to what your rhythm section is playing. Remember that the notes you are playing will sound different based on their relationships with the underlying chord. If the rhythm section is playing a C major chord, for example, playing a C or G will sound very consonant (meaning it will mesh well), while playing an F-sharp will clash and sound dissonant. Strive for a balance between consonance and dissonance.

, Google ""death metal bands"" and see what you come up with. Some of the best bands to learn from are Obituary, Death, Morbid angel, Necrophagist, but these bands have highly technical guitar parts that might take years to get down tight.

, Before you run off buying equipment to play, try learning a song or two. A good place to start is Cannibal Corpse's ""Infinite Misery.""

, There's technical death metal, which is more complex. Melodic death metal includes more melody then an all out assault of sound.

, A good distortion pedal is necessary, and an overdrive pedal is good too. Make sure your amp sounds good with death metal. You don't need an entire stack, but waging a metal war on a little 8-watt practice amp is a bad idea.

, Boost your guitar signal into amp with overdrive pedal. Set the level to max and distortion to min. Amp EQ settings should accent the highs and diminish the middle a bit. Most death metal uses de-tuned (and sometimes 7-string) guitars, so adjust accordingly.

, Ideally, this should be another guitar or bass guitar player. Death metal drumming is hard to keep up with at a beginner level.

, If your joints start to hurt or your fingers bleed, take a break.

Know that there are seven basic things you'll use to spice this up and make it a solo rather than just a scale.",How to Master Lead Guitar Basics1," A lead guitarist generally plays single note lines, meaning they aren't playing chords so much as solos and licks. A lick, or riff, is a short piece of guitar work that is often repeated through the verse and chorus. A solo is when the lead guitarist takes center stage and commands the melody line..






;
, The pentatonic minor scale is by far the most commonly used scale in rock, blues, pop, and even some jazz. It is also the simplest scale to learn, following a basic ""box"" pattern.









Here's the complete A minor pentatonic scale on all 6 strings, shown in tab:

---------------------5-8----
-----------------5-8--------
-------------5-7------------
---------5-7----------------
-----5-7--------------------
-5-8------------------------



, A lead guitarist needs to know their scales so well they never have to think about what notes they are playing. You want the scale to come so naturally that any idea you have for a riff can be found almost instantly.









Once you feel comfortable learn other scales, like the major and minor, to expand your tone and playing.

, You can keep the exact same shape of the pentatonic scale no matter where you start it, meaning you can change key by simply changing the starting note. You can do the same with the major and minor scales, as well.Keep the same number of frets between your fingers no matter where you start - the position changes but the pattern stays the same.









For example, here's the scale in C:

-------------------------8-11
---------------------8-11----
----------------8-10---------
-----------8-10--------------
------8-10-------------------
-8-11------------------------



, Your index and ring fingers are the most dexterous, and can spread to cover a large range of notes. That said, the fastest lead players focus on using their whole hand to play -- some even curl their thumb up to fret the 6th string on occasion.








,









These are string bending, string skipping, slides, hammer-ons, pull-offs, vibrato, and chromaticism.

"
"
Bend notes for a bluesy, well-articulated pitch.,
Practice ""landing"" your bends on the same note one, two, or three frets down.,
Skip strings to create sudden jumps in pitch and spice up solos.,
Use slides to quickly and seamlessly move up and down the neck.,
Hammer on to other notes to quickly sound them out without having to pick.,
Use pull-offs as in inverse of a hammer-on, picking a note with your fretting hand.,
Flutter your fretting finger with a small, back and forth bend to get vibrato.,
Add in several ""wrong"" notes to your scales to explore chromaticism.,
Work on ""harmonic picking"" to create a high-pitched, clear tone on a note, known as a harmonic.,
Create natural harmonics by lightly draping your fretting finger right over a fret, not pushing down, when it is picked.",How to Master Lead Guitar Basics2," With your finger on the note, pick the string. Then push the string up with your finger still on the fret, causing the string to bend and the pitch of the note to rise. Use any available fingers that are hanging around doing nothing to help you bend the string -- many guitarists use their ring finger to bend, with their index and middle on the string to provide strength.








, Don't just bend it to any old random pitch, bend it so that the note you produce is the same as the one either 1, 2 or 3 frets above the fret you're on. Bending in between frets creates an off-key tone, which can be good for blues songs (see ""Southern Man""), but should be used sparingly.









Bending to the note 1 fret up is called a half ""bend.""
Bending to the note 2 frets up is a whole ""bend.""
And a bend that hits the note 3 or more frets up is an ""overbend.""

, Skipping a string and moving on creates tension in the audience, who expect the next note in the scale. This sort of surprise and suspense is key to a great lead player -- always keeping the audience on their toes.









You can skip as many strings as you heart desires, but be warned that skipping too many tends to make the scale sound kind of bizarre.
Skipping multiple strings, like going from the top of scale rapidly to the bottom, is a cool way to get ""two"" tones out of your guitar -- deep and low and high and bright.

, Basically, instead of picking the next note in the scale, you just slide your finger up from the note you're on to the one you want. You can go either direction, helping you get all around the guitar without a moment of silence. When sliding, work on landing as close to the fret you want as possible for the best tone.








, Hammer-ons are a way to sound out notes without your strumming hand, which can make you amazingly fast. To do it, simply land your finger down on the string at the fret you want hard enough that you hear it ""picked."" Work on landing this finger just hard enough to hear the note -- too hard can make it go sharp.









Aim to make your hammer-ons sound as loud as a normally picked note.
Hammer-ons can be played anywhere, but are most common with the ring finger. You pick a normal note, fretted with the index finger (for example, the 3rd fret) and then quickly hammer on the ring finger (for example, the 5th fret) to get two back-to-back notes.

, Again, pull-offs use your fretting hand to ""pick"" notes, making your scales much faster. To pull-off, put your index finger on a fret and your ring finger on a fret, same string, two frets down. Then, as you remove the ring finger, snap slightly down to pluck the string. Keep your index finger down to play this note.









Combining hammer-ons and pull-offs so that you can quickly play three notes with one pick is an essential skill. Pick one note, hammer on two frets down, then pull off to get to the original note again. How long can you string these three notes together without picking again?

, Vibrato is a shaken, or ""vibrated"" note. It is a small way to put some emphasis and emotion into a single note. You can have a deep vibrato, pulling back and forth with half bends, or something more subtle, just shaking the string back and forth for a little extra flavor. The vibrato should come from the wrist, and it should cause the pitch of the note to waver or flutter rapidly.








, Chromaticism is the art of adding ""passing notes,"" notes that aren't actually in the scale but serve to get you from one note to another with a little more spice or flash. Oftentimes it involves trying out a middle finger or a pinky in the middle of your scale to see how a new note sounds. While they can make unique, tasty licks, never hold on these notes for long -- they are technically off-key and should just be used for light coloring and detail in the solo.








, To create them, all you do is let the flesh of your thumb briefly brush against the string while you pick it, as if you were picking it twice rapidly -- once with a pick, once with your thumb.









Doing this at different places on the string gives different harmonics -- effectively doubling the types of notes you can play.

, Harmonics are most easily created at the 5th, 7th, 12th, and 19th frets by resting your finger very lightly directly over the metal fret without pressing the string down to the fingerboard. Then pick and very quickly lift your finger off the string.








"
"
Work on ""sweep picking,"" where you glide down 4-5 strings in one fluid motion.",How to Master Lead Guitar Basics3," Speed picking is something you can use for a dramatic effect, or to play occasional blazing solos free of hammer-ons and pull-offs. To do it, simply ""sweep"" the pick down or up across the strings. However, as you do, you need your fretting hand to speed through the scale at the exact same speed. The goal is to only ""pick"" all the strings once but still play 7-8 notes. As you sweep, you play 1-3 notes per string. Once your pick reaches the next string, your hand must too.









Basic hint: Get the heaviest pick you can find, and let it glide across the strings very lightly, at an angle, for the best results.
This is well mixed with chromaticism -- the notes come so fast that a few of them ""off key"" actually work pretty well.

"
"
Toss the pick and use one-handed tapping for the rapid, 1980's style hair metal solos.,
Hammer on and pull-off exclusively with the fretting hand.,
Bring your ""strumming hand"" within 3-4 frets of your fretting hand and start hammering on the same string.",How to Master Lead Guitar Basics4," One-handed tapping is the high-pitched, incredibly fast sounding guitar popularized by Eddie Van Halen and others in the 80's. To do it, you simply use both hands, not just the picking hand, to hammer on and pull off 3-5 notes at once.








, For the best beginner practice, simply start with two notes. Hammer on one, pull off to the other, then hammer on again, repeating in it until it is fluid and comfortable. Get a rhythm going so that you can keep









One finger should never move -- this will be your root note, the one every pull off comes back to.

, While it may be called one-handed tapping, you do use both hands. Simply start a similar hammer-on / pull-off pattern with the index and middle finger of your strumming hand, so that you have four fingers hammering on at once. From here, you can move your hands further apart, together, to other strings, or up and down the neck.








"
"
Review your major and minor pentatonic scale shapes, playing them until you have them down cold.,
Bend or slide the minor thirds a half-step into the major scale.,
Use mixed notes, like the minor third, to transition between scales.,
Find your ""relative blues scale"" attached to the front of the major scale.,
Use the flat five, or ""blues note"" in the relative minor pentatonic for easy transitions.",How to Mix Major and Minor Pentatonic Scales on Guitar," Pentatonic means ""five tones."" It is formed by removing the 2nd and 6th notes from a normal major scale, but you can ignore theory if you're just looking to play. Make sure you can play these both backward and forwards before mixing them.










A-Major Pentatonic:

e|---------------------5-7-------------|
B|-----------------5-7-----------------
G|-------------4-6---------------------|
D|---------4-7-------------------------|
A|-----4-7-----------------------------|

E|-5-8---------------------------------|;
, This is easiest to both see and practice on the 1st string, 8th fret, which is the last note of the minor pentatonic scale. The next fret after, the 9th, is actually the 4th note of the major scale. Bending or sliding into it carefully, but beautifully, blends the scales. You can also play the identical fret on the low-E (6th) string as well.













There is another minor third on the 3rd string, 5th fret that bends well into the next step.
This bend likes to ""resolve"" on the root note -- the nearest A (for example, the 1st string, 5th fret).

, The simply bend illustrated above is a great way to ease your way back and forth between the scales. For example, play in the minor scale, then bend the half-step on the minor third. As you drop the bend, move to the actual third (fretting or picking the note you just bend to) to transition into the major scale. You can see it in action with the lick in the video above.












, For complex musical theory reasons, a minor pentatonic scale with the root three frets up from a major scale will fit seamlessly in your song. For example, in the key of A-major, which starts on the 5th fret, you can also play the F# Minor Blues Scale, which is basically the pentatonic scale started on the 2nd fret.










F#-Minor Blues Pentatonic:

e|---------------------2-8-------------|
B|-----------------2-5-----------------
G|-------------2-4-5--------------------|
D|---------2-4-------------------------|
A|-----2-3-4-----------------------------|
E|-2-5---------------------------------|, The flat fifth of the minor pentatonic blues scale (the note right between the 3rd and 4th notes of the scale) is your minor third, just like the one used above. You can, and should, bend and slide it often when mixing scales.

Set your action.,
Tune your strings.,
Set the strings to prevent buzzing.,
Check the guitar nut.,
Check out your frets.,
Tune and restring the guitar.",How to Make Your Guitar Feel Like an Ibanez," No matter what bridge you might have, you may be able to set it just about where Ibanez has theirs. Examine an authentic Ibanez and experience the feel and sound of their guitar, paying special attention to where the bridge is set. Then mimic that setting on your own guitar, putting your bridge where it feels most similar to the Ibanez. If you want to, use a guide with a straight edge so it lays almost or is flat across the strings on floating bridges. Make sure not to set the bridge too far away from where it was originally, or you won't be able to play at all.
, After raising or lowering the bridge, your strings will be out of tune. Using a tuner, tune your strings until they are fully tuned in E-A-D-G-B-E configuration. Tune them to your preference and make sure they sound right and hit the right notes. Don't worry about buzzing just yet, though.

, Buzzing is a major problem when strings are set very low, and most of the buzz comes from the lower strings. To stop this, try using a different gauge of strings. You may think that using thicker strings is counterproductive, but in fact they will be more tensioned when tuned and they will buzz less and will stay in tune longer. Still, thicker strings are not always the best way to fix buzzing. Depending on precisely when and where the buzzing occurs, your diagnosis (and the solution) might be slightly different, so check to make sure all the nuts and frets are in place and secure, then figure out when and where the buzzing occurs before you proceed., Ensure that they are glued down properly. If this doesn't fix the buzzing, you may have to change the nut height. Ibanez guitars straight from the factory are set up either on a slight incline towards the nut or just flat across. If yours are not right, try adjusting them.


To remove the nut, use a sharp blade that is designed specifically for cutting, such as a box cutter or X-acto knife, to cut away the finish. Cut in front, behind, and at the sides, then, gently tap the nut out of its placement.
Replace the nut. After the nut is out, replace any wood that came out and then dry fit the new nut. Almost every single nut is imperfect and will require a sanding to make it fit. The best guitar nut to replace the old one is a roller nut, but many are not adjustable, so find one at size or simply add wood underneath to raise the nut. To glue it in place, use wood glue mixed with water, because you may soon need to replace it again.







, If you still can't get that Ibanez feel, then try replacing your frets with something different. However, buying an Ibanez is cheaper than having someone redo your frets, and unless you know what you're doing, trying to do them on your own could destroy your neck. If you think this is necessary in order to make your guitar feel like an Ibanez, it may not be worth the expense and risk, so think carefully before taking this step.

, After getting everything to feel just right to you, tune or restring your guitar and play, making small adjustments as necessary. Many adjustments will probably be needed to the way you play, so play and correct your action until the result is satisfactory to you."

Number frets from the head of the guitar down to the body.,
Always play behind the note you’re supposed to be fretting.,
Know that fret numbering is the same on any string.,
Consider unfretted, or open strings, to be on the “zero” fret.,
Read the dots on the guitar to help your locate frets.",How to Number Guitar Frets," The head of the guitar is where the strings are tied into the tuning peg. The first fret, then, is the one right after the head. For a right-handed guitarist, this means fret number one is the fret the furthest to the left on the guitar.






;
, By the “back,” this means the side closest to the headboard. If you want to play the 3rd fret, you would need to put your finger on the string between the 2nd and 3rd frets. You are always playing the fret closest to your body -- so the 5th fret would be between the 4th and 5th frets, right up to the back of the 5th.









A quick pro tip – getting your finger as close to the back of the fret as possible

, It doesn’t matter if you’re fretting a note on the sixth string or the second – the fret numbering stays the same up and down the strings.









To talk about certain frets, you usually give the string and fret number – saying, for example, “5th string, 2nd fret,” to explain which note you’re playing.

, Any tab or song that notes a “0” for the fret is not talking about a hidden zero fret, it simply means you play the string openly, without fretting. These are called ""open notes.""








, The dots on a guitar aren’t random – they are largely standardized guidelines to help you move quickly along the fretboard. Usually, there are single or double dots on the 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 12th, and 15th frets.









There are almost always double dots on the 12th fret, as this tells you where the frets reset. Anything played on the 12th fret is an identical note (though higher-pitched) to the same open string. The 13th fret is identical to the 1st, and so on."

Use these dimensions to buy your fabric. Choose exterior fabric in a color or pattern you like. Interior fabric is optional for lining the case and could be in a complementary or contrasting shade to your exterior fabric. Duck cloth is a plain, heavy cotton fabric used for padding; its color won’t show.;
, Lay the guitar on a piece of paper and trace around it’s edge with a pencil. Then make a second, darker line that is ¾ inch larger on all sides to make sure the case is not too tight on your guitar. Cut the shape out along the darker line.Measure all the way around the outside edge of the pattern once you cut it out. About half this number is a good length for a zipper and about double this number is a good length for piping, if you choose to use it.

, Using the pattern you created on paper, cut out 2 pieces of your exterior fabric, 2 pieces of the duck cloth, and 2 pieces of fleece/batting. Then cut the 2 pieces of fleece/batting to be ½ inch smaller all around to reduce bulk when sewing.

, Place 1 piece of your fleece/batting on top of 1 piece of duck cloth, and then place 1 piece of your exterior fabric on top of that. Do the same with the second set of pieces. One set will be the front panel of your case and the other set will be the back panel. Then, use a sewing machine to quilt the pieces together, using straight lines across the length of the fabric. Do this on both panels., If you want to add piping to the edging of your case for a finished look, you can do so by pinning it around the edge of your front and back panels and then sewing it on with a basting stitch on your machine (straight stitch at the longest length)., Measure the thickness or depth of your guitar from front to back to find the width of the zipper panel (The side section of your case that will have a zipper). Add an extra 1 ¼ inch to your measurement for seam allowance, and another ½ inch or so if you want your case to be roomier. Then divide this measurement in half, because you will need two pieces to place the zipper in between. The length of these pieces is the length of the zipper you bought (approximately half the perimeter of your guitar).


Width of zipper panel pieces = (guitar depth + 1 ¼ inch + ~½ inch) ÷ 2 Length of zipper panel pieces = length of zipper

, Using the measurement for your zipper panel pieces, cut 2 pieces of exterior fabric, 2 pieces of duck cloth, and 2 pieces of fleece/batting. Cut the fleece/batting ½ inch smaller all the way around to reduce bulk when sewing. Place the exterior fabric on top of the fleece/batting on top of the duck cloth, and quilt the pieces together as you did with the front and back panels, using one or two lines across the length of the fabric., Place the zipper face down against the “right side” (the side with your exterior fabric showing) of one of your quilted zipper panel pieces. Pin it in place, then sew together using a zipper foot on your sewing machine.Do the same to attach the other side of the zipper to your second zipper piece. Then press your zipper panel open and top stitch on either side of the zipper, about ⅛ inch away from it for a finished look that will hold your zipper open on the back side., Measure around the outside edge of the front or back panel that you’ve already quilted. The difference between this measurement and the length of your zipper panel is the length of the side panel (the side section of your case that doesn’t have a zipper). Add ½ inch for seam allowance. The width is the same as your completed zipper panel.Width of side panel = width of zipper panel with zipper
Length of side panel = perimeter of front panel - length of zipper panel + ½ inch

, Using the measurement for your side panel, cut a piece of exterior fabric, duck cloth, and fleece/batting. Cut the fleece/batting ½ inch smaller all the way around to reduce bulk when sewing. Place the exterior fabric on top of the fleece/batting on top of the duck cloth, and quilt the pieces together as you did with the zipper panel, using one or two lines across the length of the fabric., Line up one end of your zipper panel with one end of your side panel, with right sides (exterior fabric) facing toward each other. Pin and sew these ends together with a straight stitch on your sewing machine, with ¼ inch seam allowance. Repeat with the opposite ends of the two panels. This will create one large loop panel.

, Take the loop panel you created from connecting the zipper and side panels and sew an edge of it to one of the two panels you made for the front and back of the case. The right sides (exterior fabric) of the panels should be facing in.


Decide where you want the zipper to be at this stage. Sew the zipper section of the loop panel to the back panel wherever you want the case to open: it could be along one full side of the case, or slightly more curved around the base or neck, depending on how you would want to pull your guitar out.
Use a heavy needle in your sewing machine if you’re having trouble getting through all the layers of fabric and duck cloth.
If you decided to use piping, make sure it is sandwiched between the two panels and that your stitch comes as close to the piping as possible. Use a zipper foot on your sewing machine for this., Pin the front panel to the other edge of the loop panel and sew together as you did with the back panel. Make sure you unzip the zipper first so you have a way to turn it right side out when all the sewing is done.

, Using scraps or extra fabric, cut a rectangle depending on what size you feel would be comfortable to hold. Add and inch to either side of the length for where you will sew it to the case. Add about ¼ inch on every side, and fold those in to hide the raw edges. Sew a straight stitch ⅛ inch from each side to make it look finished.


Double or triple the fabric or add fleece/batting inside two layers of it if you want to make the handle sturdier. You can even roll up a section of material to make a rounder handle.

, Put your guitar inside the case and pin the handle to the side panel (not the zipper panel) section of your case. Pick it up from the handle and see how the weight of the guitar is balanced. Move the handle to where the weight will be balanced equally, then sew a 1 inch square on each end of the handle to the case., Use the same measurements for each of the panels you made for the case to cut your interior fabric into 2 front and back pieces, 2 pieces for either side of the zipper, and one side piece.

, Create the same loop as you did with the zipper and side panels, but without the zipper. Place the two pieces for either side of the zipper next to each other and fold back ¼ inch where the zipper would be. Then sew the ends of the zipper pieces to the ends of the side piece like you did to make a loop before, but keeping the small folds for a zipper in place. Sew this loop to the front and back lining pieces like you did with the main case., Use fabric glue or hand sew the lining to the inside of the case by matching the seam allowance of the lining to the seam allowance of the main case. Fold under any raw edges as you go.

Know that the thinnest string is considered the 1st string and the top the 6th.,
Look at and memorize the strings.,
Remember the acronym for the strings, starting from the top down.The acronym for this way is ""Eddie Ate Dynamite, Goodbye Eddie"".,
Teach someone else the strings to ensure that you remember them well.,
Learn the strings backwards to move fluidly through the strings.",How to Learn the Strings of a Guitar," This is often the hardest part to remember. But the bottom string is the first string, not the top one. The bottom string is always the thinnest. Again, this might not feel intuitive, but it is easy to get used to. The bottom string the 1st string -- and it is an E.









You can learn the strings up or down -- but you need to remember which string is which number to help read guitar tabs and talk about notes.
""Heavy"" strings are thicker, often wound with a different type of metal, while lighter strings are thinner.;
, If you're a visual learner, you can quickly memorize the following chart. The top of it, the line closest to this paragraph, is for the 6th string, the heaviest. A lowercase ""e"" is used for the first string to differentiate it from the thicker E on the sixth string.










Sixth: E

Fifth: A

Fourth: D

Third: G

Second: B

First: e

, If it helps, you can try to make up your own acronym or find some others on the internet:









The thickest string is the E string. Remember this as ""Eddie"".
The next string is the A string. Remember this as ""Ate"".
The next string is the D string. Remember this as ""Dynamite"".
The next string is the G string. Remember this as ""Good"".
The next string is the B string. Remember this as ""Bye"".
The thinnest string is another E string. Remember this as ""Eddie"".

, The best way to know you know something is to teach it to others. Teach your mum, teach your sister, even teach a guitarist. They can help you if you get it wrong. If you don't want to teach anyone, post a post-it note on your wardrobe with the string names on it, reviewing every day.









Play each string, then name the note. You can make this little test harder by having a friend play the string while you have to get the right answer.
Learning the rest of the notes as well is key to moving forward as a guitarist.

, The acronym for this way is ""Easter Bunny Gets Drunk At Easter"" or ""Every Body Gets Drunk At Easter"". Inventing your own acronym can help too:









The thinnest string is the E string. Remember this as ""Every"" or ""Easter"".
The next string is the B string. Remember this as ""Body"" or ""Bunny"".
The next string is the G string. Remember this as ""Gets"".
The next string is the D string. Remember this as ""Drunk"".
The next string is the A string. Remember this as ""At"".
The thickest string is another E string. Remember this as ""Easter"".

Consider your index finger as your first finger.,
Think of your middle finger as the second finger.,
Recognize your ring finger as your third finger.,
Remember that your pinky is the fourth finger.,
Use the circled numbers above a musical staff to determine which finger to play with.",How to Number Your Fingers for Guitar Playing," Finger numbering is not very common on guitar, but it does appear in sheet music and some chord diagrams. Your most mobile finger and the furthest to outside when playing the guitar, is your index finger. It is your first finger.









If you hold you hand up to your face, palm facing you, you simply number the fingers from left to right, ignoring your thumb.;
, Your fingers simply count up from index to pinky. This makes your second finger the middle finger.








, Your ring finger is perhaps the second most commonly used in guitar, so get used to the third finger now.








, The hardest to get used to using but crucial for complex notes, solos, and chords, the pinky is your 4th finger.








, Finger numberings are most common above a musical staff, where they tell you which finger to use. The circled number will be right above the appropriate note.

Warm up your hands.,
Use warm up exercises on the fretboard.,
After you have done these steps and your playing at a gig, use gloves to get you there to keep your hands warm.

",How to Make Your Fingers Their Best for Guitar," Do not soak them in warm water, as the callouses on your hands will be weakened by it, and your fingers will sting. Try instead holding a cup of hot coffee, tea, or using a hand warmer, or just sitting on top of them for a few minutes, if you can't find anything else.;
, A good one for alternate picking is 1-2-3-4 ascending and 4321 descending, 5-7 ascending and 7-5 descending and moving those around. This will increase your dexterity over time and is particularly helpful with shredding.

Listen and mimic the phrasing of great singers to learn how to use space effectively.,
Leave space between repeated themes or motifs.,
Use a serious of silences to slowly build power.,
Use silences to highlight the backing track.,
Think of the solo or lick as a story, using silences to give the audience a break.",How to Leave Space Between Guitar Notes," Singers cannot hit as many notes, as quickly, as guitarists. They also must pause to breathe. This has lead vocalists to develop innovative, melodic ways to put space into their vocals. You can even think of a good public speaker -- notice how they don't just talk and talk and talk -- they leave space before big points (or notes, riffs, solos, etc.) so that the audience has time to get ready for the dazzling next section.;
, Many guitarists use a repeated set of notes, often similar to the melody of the singers, to give their solos a a backbone or common set of notes. But you don't want to play the theme too frequently. Try your 3-5 note riff once, give a half-measure of space, then play it again, slightly changing the the last few notes to throw the audience off guard or launch into a different set of notes.

, This is common in many blues solos, such as the work of B.B. King. The first few riffs are only 2-3 notes, then silence. Then 4-5 notes, followed by a shorter silence, until the silences get smaller and the notes get longer. By the end, you've risen the energy and mood into a screaming, killer solo with no silences.

, Great guitarists do not play over the rest of the instruments, blocking them out, but with them. Leave space for a big bass lick or not, to let a drum fill sound out without being muffled, or give the backup singers a chance to shine. Furthermore, opening up these spaces lets your play off the other instruments when they're done, making you look extra professional.

, Even high-energy action movies don't go full-speed the whole time. Giving a chance for silence makes the fast parts more meaningful and easier for the listener to understand. These silences make the more exciting sections of your solo pop more in a listeners ear, just like calm moments in an action movie proceed the biggest explosions and fights."

Have your guitar set up properly.,
Listen and repeat.,
Mix up the hard stuff and the easy stuff.,
Avoid stomp boxes when you practice.,
Learn music.",How to Play Beginner's Electric Guitar1," Getting your guitar set up correctly is one of the main keys to having a good learning experience. You can get this done by the guitar guru at the music store, a professional musician, or the owner of your local guitar repair shop. There are a couple primary benefits to having your guitar set up properly:


Good intonation. This is maybe the most critical thing. Your guitar should be accurate so that when it's in tune (and you're playing the right notes), it will sound right. If your guitar has bad intonation, it may be in tune on the lower strings, but terribly out-of-tune when playing higher notes. This will be discouraging, and make it much harder to learn.
Ease of playing. A guitar that's set up too high can be nearly impossible to play, as it can take an enormous amount of finger pressure to press down the string onto the frets. Not only will this cause intonation problems, it will hurt, and it will slow you down! In time you will develop calluses on your fingers to ease the pain, but it will still be difficult to play fast runs or switch up chords easily.;
, Virtually every song you like has a recognizable melodic pattern, some sort of memorable turn of notes. Don't limit yourself to just the guitar solos—though that's always good to learn—but also listen to the singer, to the bass lines, little fills and noodles from the guitarist. Anything that catches your ear will work—the simpler, the better, as you are learning.


For example, the melody to Locked Out of Heaven by Bruno Mars is fairly simple, and has little vocal hooks and phrasings that you can try to imitate with the guitar.

Call Me Maybe from Carly Rae Jepsen has a catchy melody, but it also has a distinctive string backup pattern that would be a good challenge.

Gangnam Style by Psy has an insistent synth line that starts right at the beginning, and runs throughout the song. While you can't get all the ""synthy"" tone, you can get the basic lick down and then have fun with it!
The key here is not to become a guitar legend by learning solos—it's to become a guitar legend by learning to listen and be able to play what you hear.
If you have trouble catching part of a tune, try watching the YouTube video for it: often times, there will be shots of the band playing that bit.

, Give yourself a ""mental"" break after working on something difficult by playing something easier, something you're comfortable with. This will keep your fingers moving, keep you improving steadily, and help keep you from getting discouraged.









Make sure you always have hard stuff to work on! This is how you will grow as a guitarist.
Work the things you have a hard time with more frequently than the things you have an easy time accomplishing. For example, if you find you are good at playing fast single-note solos, that's great! Keep practicing that skill. If you have a hard time with chords, then make sure you practice those at least as much as you practice single-note solos.

, Sure, a stomp box will give you awesome shredding tone, and sustain forever, but it also does something else: it masks errors in technique.


A pure, clean guitar tone will expose every flaw in your playing. Save the shred tone for when you're jamming with your friends, or just cutting loose on your own.

, As you develop as a guitarist, you will learn to appreciate the ""shortcuts"" music theory can give you.


For example, Instead of having to fiddle around to find the right chords to a song, a knowledge of music theory will enable you to know what the likely chords are in any given key.
It will also let you converse musically with other players—especially useful if you start a band. For example, a keyboardist will not be able to interpret your finger positions when you say ""play this chord."" A keyboard and guitar are not at all alike in how the notes are presented. However, if you say ""Play an A7 then a B7 then back to E,"" he will be likely to understand you.

Find a good guitar teacher.,
Learn to read music.,
Keep it fun.,
Practice.",How to Play Beginner's Electric Guitar2," What makes a good guitar teacher will be different for everybody. Some people learn by watching, some learn by hearing. You may want to find somebody who specializes in the kind of music you like, or somebody who just knows how to get the best results no matter what style of music the student prefers. Find the best style for your way of learning.


The style of music you like is only one consideration. For example, a guitarist who prefers the blues might take lessons in flamenco-style guitar. While flamenco and blues are not at all alike in style or substance, the techniques for flamenco guitar are much more involved, and could result in a guitarist with much more complex blues style.

, Whatever teaching style you prefer, make sure it includes reading music. Because there are six strings involved, and many notes that can be played on different strings, playing guitar by reading music is not easy. Training in this skill is very helpful.

, No matter what style of music you're learning, taking lessons involves a certain amount of tedium: repetition, difficulties, more repetition, and exercises that are much more about wiggling your fingers the right way than they are about actually sounding interesting. This can lead to burnout if you don't keep it fun!









Practice the lessons set out for you, and then when you're done, close the book and play what you like, any way that you like.
When practicing scales or patterns and you think your mind is going to go numb from boredom, spice up the scales or patterns with embellishments. Make sure you work on the actual notes so that you learn the techniques assigned, but also try things like using bends instead of frets for close notes; adding varying degrees of vibrato; turning on the distortion, reverb, and delays; playing the same music backwards. The idea is to do anything to break the routine and keep it interesting.

, Whether you're learning on your own or taking lessons, the only way you'll get better is by practicing, or ""woodshedding."" This means practicing and playing as often as you can, for as long as you can.









Learning to play the guitar involves many things: building strength and endurance in your fingers, learning where the notes are on the guitar, building ""muscle memory,"" playing cleanly, and playing with feeling. These all take time to develop, and some parts will happen faster than others. Just keep at it, and you will get the hang of it.
Every single guitarist you've ever heard of or listened to on the radio or admired has been exactly where you are. They also have one other thing in common: they never stopped playing and practicing!

Become familiar with Thrash Metal.,
Learn guitar scales, chords, and note locations in order to find out what notes go together and what notes do not.

,
Learn alternate picking.,
Be determined.,
Play songs by other Thrash Metal bands and mess around with their riffs.,
When you have a basic riff put together work with it until you decide it is acceptable.,
If you are in a band, play your riff for the rest of your bandmates and get their opinions on the riff.,
When you have a riff that sounds good but maybe isn't fast enough, use the double picking form.,
Also make sure to know that not all Thrash riffs are fast.,
Have fun and be open to anything.",How to Write Thrash Guitar Riffs," You can't write something you know nothing about. Find what kind of Thrash Metal you like best whether it is the heavier form (Slayer, Evil, Testament, etc.) or the somewhat softer form (Metallica, Megadeth, Anthrax, etc.) and choose which one you would rather play. There are actually many forms of thrash. These forms are blackened thrash (Sodom, Toxic Holocaust, Venom, etc.), crossover thrash or a combo of thrash and hardcore punk (Municipal Waste, Anthrax, DRI, SOD, Nuclear Assault, etc.), death/thrash (Kreator, Slayer, Morbid Saint, Possessed, etc.), melodic thrash (Overkill, Havok, etc.) and technical thrash (Metallica, Kreator, Destruction, etc).;
,, Thrash Metal is a real fast genre of music so learning alternate picking (picking up and down quickly) is essential. Also power chords are also a large part of Thrash Metal so get used to using them.

, The main step of writing Thrash is just like writing any other form of music and that is determination. You usually aren't going to write the best Thrash Metal song in one night so work at it. Work with notes, power chords, etc. to give you some sort of idea.

, Doing so sometimes can give you ideas of your own.


Do not copy other bands' riffs at all. First of all, it doesn't help you out learning to write your own riffs by just copying everyone else all the time, and you could also run into some copywriting problems.

, Sometimes you have to throw out riffs completely because either they sound too much like another bands riff or because they just don't sound good. Be open to improvement and don't be afraid to change something.

, Listen to their suggestions and ideas and see if any of them work.

, Double picking is mostly used on an open note, especially the Lower E, so use this in your riff to make it faster and more ferocious.

, Some are slow and chugging-sounding so use this other form of riffs in your music as well. Don't be depressed if your riff doesn't sound good when played blistering fast.

, Only use other bands' riffs as a template if you are beginning to write. When you write a lot of riffs you will develop your own style of playing and then you don't have to rely on other bands' material. Also, don't be afraid to be unique. It is often the most unique thrash bands that are the best.

Decide between mic recording or using a direct box (DI).,
Invest in a digital audio workstation (DAW) or comparable software.,
Prepare your electric guitar.",How to Record Electric Guitar1," Recording the sound of your electric guitar by miking your amp is a great way to simulate studio quality sound. However, this will require expensive equipment, like a quality amp, microphone, and potentially sound dampening equipment or material. On the other hand, you can plug your guitar right into a DI to record your guitar.A limitation of using a DI is the somewhat sterile nature of the recording it produces. A DI will only record the sound of your guitar, without any effects or normal speaker distortion.;
, You'll need a program or machine that can interpret the recording you make and convert it into a suitable format. This kind of technology usually has the added benefit of allowing you to edit the sound you will record.DAWs and sound production software cover a range of features. Some are free, and some can be over $800 in cost.The most suitable DAW/software depends entirely on your purposes and situation.

, Even with the best equipment adjusted to optimal settings, if you forget to tune your guitar, your recording probably won't turn out like you want. You may also want to replace your strings, as new strings create a brighter tone and have better sustain.Finger sliding can make unwanted squeaks while recording. Apply fretboard lubricant to your guitar beforehand to help prevent these from occurring."
"
Decide between an active and passive DI.,
Purchase your DI.,
Hook up your DI.,
Record yourself play electric guitar.,
Tweak your amp simulator settings, if applicable.",How to Record Electric Guitar2," The most obvious difference between the two is that an active DI requires a power supply for you to operate, while passive DIs do not. Beyond that, due to differences in design, each of these has strong suits that should be taken into consideration. For example, the transformers used in passive DIs are more resistant to the hum created by ground loops, making these ideal for on-stage performing.Additionally:



Active DIs are generally better suited to passive instruments, including:

Electric guitars
Passive basses
Vintage Rhodes pianosPassive DIs are generally better suited to active instruments, like:

Active basses
Keyboards
Electronic percussion, There are many options of DI available, some packaged with features that you might find useful. Amp simulators, for example, can be layered on top of your DI recording. This will give your recording a sound more like what you'd hear produced from an amp.


Though the use of a DI can be relatively cheap, quiet, and space efficient, most audio experts agree that even masterful DI recordings miss a quality captured through miking an amp.The price range for DIs varies considerably, with lower end models costing as little as $40 and high end models costing over $1,000.Some audio experts recommend investing $1 in a DI for ever $5 you spend on your instrument., You should always follow the directions that came with your DI, but generally, you should be able to hook it up by connecting your guitar with a ¼"" output cable. Then you will need to connect your DI output, which will likely be an XLR connection, to your mixing console/audio interface/computer.


Due to the fact that the signal being transmitted from your DI to your mixing console is normalized to the microphone level, you'll need to connect the DI output to your mixing console's mic input., Set your DAW/audio interface to ""Record"" and play your music. When you have finished, stop recording and listen to what you have played on headphones. Keep in mind, your DI will only have captured the sound of your guitar, and because of this, your recording might sound thin, or like it is lacking something.


Through the use of amp simulators, you can add normal distortion and speaker effects to your recording, which will fill out the sound.

, If you have an amp simulator at your disposal, you can add its effects to your recording to give it a more realistic sound.Listen to the changes you make with headphones, and use the simulator's interface to adjust the recording until you are satisfied with its sound quality.

Evaluate your amplifier.,
Gauge the target volume of your amp.,
Build a sound closet for budget mic recording.A homemade ""sound closet"" will allow you to crank the volume on your amp without having to worry about external noise or complaints from neighbors.Find a closet or cupboard that can comfortably house your amp and then insulate the walls and door with sound blankets to deaden the sound.Sound blankets or sound absorbing material can be bought at many hardware stores, sound production equipment stores, or online.,
Consider the use of a power soak.,
Purchase a speaker chamber, if appropriate for your situation.,
Judge the quality of your mic.,
Purchase a more suitable microphone, if necessary.",How to Record Electric Guitar3," Depending on the quality of sound you are trying to attain in your recording, you may need to use a sizable amp to richly capture the upper and lower range of your ax, as well as features like distortion and sizzle. Using the equipment available to you, decide which amp best achieves your target sound quality.


A ""guitar amp"" is frequently referred to, professionally, as a speaker cabinet. This is due to the fact that traditional amps are a combination of both speakers and an amplifier contained in a housing, called a cabinet., For home recording, it may not be possible for you to record your wicked guitar solo at the volume you need without being interrupted by family, neighbors, external noises, or a visit from the police due to a noise complaint. If your location is not conducive to recording at your target volume, you might consider:


A change of location.
Sound dampening measures (blankets, sound absorbing foam, etc.).
Using amp volume-output control equipment, like a power soak or speaker chamber/closet.

,
Two layers of sound blankets is generally sufficient for noise reduction., A power soak is a supplemental piece of equipment used in-line to reduce the volume output of an amp while maintaining tone and sustain. The signal moves through the line to the power soak, which absorbs part of the full power of the amp. This adjusted signal is transmitted to the amp, resulting in quieter volumes.A Power Soak converts the power of your amp into heat and can become very hot. Use caution and follow the directions that came with your power soak for best operation., A speaker chamber is an insulated wooden box built with its own speaker and microphone stand.This box works on the same principle as a studio isolation booth on a smaller scale.


Speaker chambers can be bought at local music/sound production stores or online.
These units are even used in a professional studio environment, or sometimes on-stage to reduce stage noise., Different styles of microphone are able to capture different ranges or qualities of sound. Some mics, like the Sennheiser e906, are designed expressly for the purpose of recording a guitar cabinet.Test your mic by:


Placing it 6"" to 8"" away from your speaker.
Positioning it to be slightly off center from the speaker cone.
Listening to the mic with headphones to check sound quality.
Adjusting the position of the mic until you find the ""sweet spot.""
NOTE: low-end sound can best be captured with your mic at a closer distance (2"" to 5"")., If you have found that your mic really doesn't capture sound the way you need, you'll have to research to find the right mic for your situation. For example, you might use a large diaphragm condenser mic to capture crisp, pop rock tones.However, you should be able to achieve consistently good recordings with the use of either a common:


Dynamic instrument microphone
Ribbon microphone"
"
Warm up your amp.,
Adjust your amp settings and dampening measures, if necessary.,
Check all connections and cords.,
Stress test your electrical supply.,
Verify the sound of your electric guitar with headphones.,
Record yourself playing your electric guitar.,
Use filters to improve the quality of your sound.",How to Record Electric Guitar4," Do this by switching your amp to standby mode without any input for at least two minutes before hooking up your guitar. Once the amp is warmed up and ready to rock, you can plug in your guitar and switch your amp to its active mode., Changing the volume on your amp can also change the tone of the sound it produces.Set your amp to its optimal volume, and if loudness is an issue, make sure you have the proper sound dampening measures in place.


If you have decided on using a power soak, tie this into your sound line as instructed in its accompanying directions.If you plan on making use of a sound closet or chamber, make sure your amp is in its proper position.

, Wear and tear might require you to finesse some of your cables or connectors into the right inputs or outputs. In particular, be sure that your guitar, amp, microphone, and DAW/audio interface are properly linked.

, Audio equipment can draw a considerable amount of current. In some cases, when too much current is drawn on an electrical circuit, a circuit breaker will be tripped and the power supply cut off. To prevent this from happening mid-recording:


Test your electrical supply by taking some time to warm up. Be sure that all the equipment you plan on using is switched on, warmed up, and set the volume at which you will record.

, Double check your tuning. If you notice that your guitar sounds too ""honky,"" meaning that it has a kind of country twang to its tone, you can change this by reducing the Mid knob. If it sounds too thick, or isn't very clear, increase the Mid knob., With everything in place and properly adjusted, all you need to do now is set your DAW/audio interface to record and begin playing. Once you have finished playing, stop the recording and check your handiwork.

, At this point, you can polish your recording through your DAW/audio interface. In many cases, this will be your computer. Once your recording is complete, you can apply filters to it to highlight certain aspects, like:


Clarity and focus. A high pass filter at 100, 150, or 200Hz can reduce the muddiness of the bass in your recording while focusing the sound.
The body of your sound. This can be emphasized or reduced by cutting or boosting your recorded sound by about 700-800Hz, setting the grit to about 3-4Khz, and changing the boxiness to 300-400Hz.
Softer high frequencies. A gentle low pass filter at 12Khz can help to reduce piercing high frequencies.

Learn the two basic Bar Chords: Much of Rock 'n' Roll uses nothing but two movable chords, called ""bar chords."",
Learn the most common Open Chords: These are the chords you see in any guitar chord chart.,
Learn the Blues Scale: The essential scale for Rock 'n' Roll leads--playing solos--is the Blues Scale.",How to Play Rock'n'roll Guitar in 3 Simple Steps," Once these two positions are learned, the chords are movable up and down the neck to play any major or minor chord.


To play a A chord, for example, use bar chord #1 at the 5th fret.
To play a D chord, either move bar chord #1 up to the D fret on the low E string, or use bar chord #2 on the 5th fret. Each of the two basic bar chords has a couple variations--for 7th, minor and minor 7th chords.

Position #1: Index finger ""barred"" across all 6 strings, ring finger two frets up on the A string, pinky two frets up (same as ring finger) on the D string, and middle finger only one fret up on the G string.


To make the chord minor, simply lift the middle finger off the G string.
To make the chord a 7th chord, lift the pinky.
To make it a minor 7th chord, lift both the middle finger and the pinky.

Position #2: Index finger barred across the five upper strings (A, D, G, B, high E), ring finger barred two frets up across the D, G. and B strings.


To make the chord a 7th, use the ring finger only on the D string and place pinky two frets up on the B string.
To play a minor, place the ring finger on the D string, the pinky on the G string (right next to the ring finger, i.e., two frets up), and the middle finger on the B String.
To play a minor 7th, use the ring finger on the D string and the middle finger on the B string (no finger on the G string other than the barred index finger).;
, They are very useful for Rock 'n' Roll, depending on the style of song you want to play.


The basic ones to know are E, A, D, G, and C. Don't even worry much about minors or 7ths, because those are just as easy to play as bar chords (see Step 1: Bar Chords). Open chords are especially useful for play arpeggios, picking one string at a time in a pattern among the notes of the chord.

, It's simple as can be, and the pattern is movable (like the bar chords, see?) up and down the fretboard, depending on the key you want to play your solo in. Learn the pattern in the key of A, which is the fifth fret on the E string. Here is the pattern : low E string 1, 4; A string 1, 2, 3; D string 1, 3 (that's one octave); G string 1, 3, 4; B string 1, 4; high E 1 (that's two octaves).


Practice this scale forever until it becomes fluid and second nature.
Start playing around with it, using only the notes of the scale, but in whatever order you like. You'll soon see that 50% of Rock 'n' Roll leads never use anything but the blues scale.

Have some money.,
Make sure you really want to do this, making a guitar can take a while and will waste your good money if you decide to quit halfway through.

,
Look through guitar magazines and on the Internet for inspiration for a design.,
Once you have a design make a scale drawing of it on graph paper, or if you are good with computers draw it on a vector drawing program like CorelDraw.,
Get access to power tools.,
Get some nice pieces of wood for the body (alder and ash are most commonly used for their sound - ash is heavier but is less expensive and alder is a lot nicer because it is lighter but probably a bit harder to find and a little more expensive), the neck (any type of maple is good for this), and the fretboard (ebony and rosewood are the two most common woods for this.,
Trace your design onto the wood for the body, include the outline and anywhere else where there will be holes or cavities for the electronics.

,
Cut out the body with your jigsaw or band saw (or hand saw).,
Hollow out the cavities for the electronics and pickups, and the area where the neck sits, and drill holes for the neck to be bolted on to.

,
Sand down the body, round out sharp edges, and do whatever you want to finish the body.

,
Get the wood you want to use for the neck, make some rough cuts to get a basic shape, cut out the area where the truss rod goes.

,
You can get a truss rod at guitar stores, repair shops, the Internet, or you could go to a hardware store and buy a threaded rod.,
Glue the fretboard on, use wood glue.,
Now you must radius the fretboard, and the only good way to do it is to get a radius sanding block on the Internet or at luthier supply stores.,
Get fret wire, pre bend it to the approximate radius and hammer it in.

,
Now you can make final cuts to your neck, drill holes for the tuners and neck blots, and sand it to its final shape.

,
Get a pickguard, bridge, nut, tuners, knobs, and electronics.,
Assemble your guitar to see how it looks, now disassemble it.

,
Get some quality spray paint and primer at a hardware store.,
Let it completely dry for a couple of weeks.

,
Assemble your guitar, assemble the electronics (you'll need a soldering iron and know how to use it.),
String it up, plug it in, and rock out!

",How to Make an Electric Guitar," You don't want to spend too much, but get what you want for your guitar.;
,, If you like a certain guitar, try to at least make some minor changes in the design to be original.

, Make a full size drawing or print out of your design to use as a plan.

, The most important tools you'll need would be a jigsaw or band saw, a belt or oscillating sander, and a drill. If you know a guy who knows a guy who's willing to help you out that is a good way to borrow the tools you need. You can also use hand tools if you want to improve your arm strength.

, The sound will be affected by which one you choose, ebony has a much tighter grain and clear sound. You can also use maple wood for the fingerboard, but ONLY on electric guitars). Avoid using plywood, unless you are on a tight budget, as it will slightly effect the sustenance of your guitar in a negative way due to its lack of density, but if you don't really care, then go for it. (More Dense=More sustain.) Mahogany, Alder, etc. are good for bodies and necks, ebony and rosewood are good for fret boards, but any hardwood will do nicely.

,, Try not to mess up because this is very important.

,,,, Insert the truss rod in the channel with some powerful glue to secure it in place.

, Go on the Internet and find the fret distances for a common scale length around 25"". (scale length=double length from nut to the twelfth fret. Get a ruler and measure out the frets and cut slots for them to sit.

, Sand out the radius and deepen the fret slots.

,,, Choose which of these you can make yourself, and which you MUST buy, because it will reduce the quality and sound of your guitar. You could buy the tuners, and electronics. You can also get a pickguard, and a nut. All a pickguard is made up of is plastic; you should be able to find some plastic in your house for free. All a nut is, is a small rectangular piece of bone, plastic or metal, you might be able to find something like that for free.

Make sure your amplifier is set up in a space without another heat producing device (e.g.,
Make sure wherever you set up your amplifier it is well ventilated.,
Do not allow an amplifier to get wet.,
Do not drop the amplifier.,
Before turning on an amp, set all controls to zero.,
When turning on an amp, set it to standby, if the amp is so equipped.,
Play through your amplifier at less than full power, if possible.,
Do not play a bass through your guitar amplifier.,
Make sure your amplifier matches your speakers.,
Replace a broken tube with the same model number.,
Plug your amp into a surge protector.,
Do not sit on your amplifier.",How to Maintain a Guitar Amplifier," radiator) close at hand. This can cause the amplifier to fail because of high temperature.;
, This, along with step one prevents any heat related failures.

, With its many electrical circuits, moisture will play havoc with an amp. An amplifier cover will come in handy for any outdoor venue under the threat of rain.

, A guitar amplifier contains wiring connections and other electrical components that can be jarred loose when dropped. Be sure to treat it with respect.

, This will guard against power surges to the various components within the amp. It likewise is a good idea to turn all controls to zero before turning your amp off. Of course, then you are ready for the next time when you turn your amp on.

, This allows any tubes a chance to warm up before kicking on the full power to the circuits.

, Some amps are equipped with half-power switches that allow one to produce music without running the amp at flat-out wattage, unless full power is needed.

, While many guitar amplifiers come with heavy-duty speakers, it is not wise to play a bass through them. The bass should have its own amp.

, Factory-produced combo amps are not a problem, but a separate amp head and speaker cabinet setup needs to be matched to factory recommended impedance values.

, Not every amplifier uses tubes, but if you own one that does, change out tubes with the same type that the amp was designed to use.

, Due to inconsistent electrical power sources, it is often wise to guard against electrical surges that would harm the amp's electrical components.

, While an amp often makes a handy seat while playing guitar, it is best not to sit on it or allow anyone else to use it as a chair.

Start by finding tablature for your favorite metal bands.,
Listen to a particular song, and find a breakdown or something that is simplistic - and find it in the tab.,Learn to palm mute, place your palm lightly over the string which you are playing at the bridge

,Learn to play simple power chord-based-riffs

,
Practice alternate picking between strings.,
Use a distorted, deep, fat tone and play with power.

,
Learn to pinch and put them into your riffs.,
Learn to string skip and learn fast skipping riffs.

,
Put it all together.

",How to Play Extreme Metal Guitar," You will find that the tab is incredibly daunting and in some cases miles beyond your technical ability. Don't worry. This is how everyone feels when first confronted by some real metal music.;
, Now attempt to learn it. Do this with several songs and you will eventually build up a repertoire of riffs which you can play.

,,, The more you practice, the better you get. It is hard at first, but try to angle your pick and practice with a metronome and it will eventually become much easier.

,, For pinch harmonics, or ""squealies"", practice on the third string 4th fret and touch your thumb over the middle pickup on your guitar. It seems impossible while first learning, but it gets easier with practice. You could also try artificial harmonics or natural harmonics.

Know what you like.,
Listen and pay attention to your sound as it is now.,
Experiment with your touch on the strings as you fret the neck.,
Change your strings.,
Replace your pickups.,
Where is your signal going?,
If you're still not satisfied, perhaps it's the guitars body.,
Technique.",How to Have Great Electric Guitar Tone," Listen to other guitarists that appeal to you and pick out what sounds good. If you don't know what sound you want, you can't get it.;
, Begin to become aware of the quality of your tone and how you can affect it. Know your guitars sound in and out with switching between your pickups and dialing the tone nob up and down.

, Try alternating the harshness of your picking. Pay attention to how your sound changes as you vary the attack. Your vibrato is your signature, it gets better with years of practice. Picking/strumming up and down the neck at different positions can add to your tone. Picking closer to the bridge makes your tone chunkier, while picking more around the neck mellows out your tone.

, Fresh strings can perk up the sound of any guitar. Different string gauges dramatically affect your playing. Experiment with a spectrum of string gauges to know what you like to play with, and what sounds good to you.

, Cheap pickups are a threat to most guitarists good pure tone. Single coil, humbuckers, P90s, telecaster pickups all have unique tone and react to your playing differently. If you're playing with stock pickups, your tone is probably suffering.

, Right into an amp? If you want effects, make sure they're quality pedals so you don't get buzzing. Don't buy too cheap because usually the effects will be cheap for a reason. If you don't have the money to buy a all tube Marshal amp, you could try using something like iRig. Lower end solid state amps are to be avoided. Examples of poor, cheap solid state amps include Line6 Spiders and Marshall MGs. This is perhaps the biggest contribution to good tone. A £100 quid guitar will sound alright through an expensive amp. A £2000 guitar will not sound good through a £100 amp

, A solid-body guitar will have a different basic tone than a hollow or semi-solid guitar will have. Depending upon your finances, purchasing a different electric guitar may bring you closer to the realm of that great tone that you have in your mind.

, Good technique will definitely help your tone and will make you able to play that Joe Satriani lick or nail that particularly hard solo. If you want to sound like someone, learning their technique style can help. For example, if you want to sound like the Red Hot Chili Peppers, you're going to need to be adept at funk and rock techniques like left hand muting and 4th finger embellishments on chords. It can also help songwriting as you are lest constrained by technique."

Remove the strings from your guitar.,
Adjust the bridge saddles as high as possible.,
Install a slide guitar nut over your guitar's existing nut.,
Restring your guitar with heavy gauge strings.,
Tune the guitar to an open tuning.,
Play your newly converted lap steel guitar.",How to Make an Electric Guitar Into a Lap Steel Guitar," The lap steel conversion is easiest to perform if the strings are removed from your guitar. This will allow you to adjust both the bridge saddles and the nut more easily, which will help you to raise the height of the strings above the fretboard.;
, The saddles on a guitar's bridge are the 6 individual grooves over which the strings pass. They can usually be adjusted either using a flat head screwdriver or an allen wrench. Adjust them until they are as high above the guitar's body as they will go.

, The strings will also need to be raised at the other end of the neck - namely, at the nut. To do this without costly and permanent modification, you'll need a specialized product called a slide guitar nut or a slide guitar extension nut. This simple metal nut can be easily fitted over the top of your existing nut, where it will be held in place by the pressure from the strings.

, Once you have adjusted both the bridge and nut, you can restring your guitar. Note that lap steel guitars are typically strung with heavy gauge strings, which allow for a beefier, more sustained tone when played with a slide.

, When tuning the strings, forgo the standard E tuning for an open tuning. Open tunings are a necessity on slide guitar, as they allow you to play a wider variety of intervals without needing to fret individual strings (which you can no longer do). Perhaps the most popular tuning for playing lap steel guitar is (from low to high) D-B-G-D-B-E.

, To play your new lap steel guitar in the traditional manner, lay the body of the guitar flat across your lap with the fretboard facing the ceiling. Use a slide on the fretboard and pick the strings either with your fingers or with a combination of thumb and finger picks.

"
"
Set up your guitar as you normally would.,
Hold the pick like you normally would, and push down on the 5th and 6th strings with the pick.,
Slide the pick up the string at an even speed.,
Once you've reached the 12th fret, slap a finger from your left hand on the fourteenth fret.,
If you don't get that awesome, dull, low-pitched 'screech', change the position of the pick, pressure from your left hand, etc.",How to Pick Slide," You'll want to boost your drive, or gain. Pick slides are improved by a distorted tone;
, These strings are the lowest and usually will produce a thicker tone than the high treble strings.

, It should make that 'screech' sound.

, Slide your left hand towards the nut and bring your right hand back to it's normal position.

, Once you get the sound, keep practicing your pick slide until you think it's perfect. You can change it for song appropriation. Be it a fast slide for an up-pace song or a long drawn out one for a heavier tune, the pick slide is a diverse technique with many applications.

Buy a Guitar, it doesn't have to be good or expensive.,
Learn some easy riffs, find a book which has many guitar riffs, you can play any type of song on your electric Guitar, don't feel tied down to one genre.

,
Learn better riffs!,Start learning whole songs, if the song has a solo, play it if you can, if not learn the rhythm behind it, so long as you feel the accomplishment of playing a whole song

,
Now that you have the basics - expand, this is vital for your electric Guitar playing, if you stick to the basic riffs you will get bored of playing, and you will not get any better.

,Learn some harder songs, push your boundaries

,
Try songs with solos, a few easy but effective solos are: Californication - Red Hot Chilli Peppers, Smells like teen Spirit - Nirvana and Teenage Kicks - The Undertones

,
Learn some new techniques, have you mastered the hammer-on and pull-off?,Start a band, anything to keep your interest going

,
Keep playing, and keep learning: if you stop learning new songs you will get bored of the ones you keep playing over and over again, and so will everyone living with you.

",How to Learn to Play Electric Guitar," Make sure you also get an amplifier, a tuner and a lead.;
,, Once you have hold of the basics, find some good riffs to play, it is extremely important to start playing exciting songs straight away, you need to keep yourself interested by playing songs which you enjoy, otherwise you will give up. Here's a few good starters:

Create (or find on the internet) a technical drawing and make a parts list.,
Print/draw a full scale model of the drawing.,
Get your wood.,
Layout your scaled drawing onto a piece of ply-wood NOT your guitar body wood.,
Use a drill press and file to do the body cavity and pickup holes (NOT the neck pocket though) and use a jig/scroll saw or a band saw to cut the outside.,
Once you are satisfied with the plywood pattern, use double sided tape (carpeting tape from any home store works great) to attach the pattern to your body wood blank.

,
Use a table router with a pattern bit or a laminate trimming bit to route the outside.,
Use a hand router with a pattern cutting bit to route out the pickup and body cavities.,
Trace the heel of the neck onto a separate piece of plywood and use a jigsaw/band saw and a miter gauge as well as a rounded file to make the neck pocket pattern.,
Use a Surform planer to carve to contour of the back and arm if desired (some people say that a spokeshave also works well but I didn't have much luck with it).

,
Sand the entire body with 100-150 grit sandpaper (orbital or palm sanders work fine) followed by 200 and 250-300 grit paper and a final wet sanding of 350 grit by hand.

,
This will give you the basic body shape that you want for a guitar.",How to Make a Solid Body Electric Guitar,";
, If you don't have a large printer use many pieces of paper taped together (poster mode on some printers). To get it perfectly to scale will take some work. First print until you get a complete dimension that you can measure (may take several pages). Measure the length of the segment. Now multiply the height of the picture in pixels, by the labeled length of the segment and divide that by the actual measured length of the segment. This will give you your new height. Use paint to re-size to this new height and make sure you select Maintain aspect ratio. Repeat this step at least twice for maximum accuracy.

, Usually a butt joint is strong enough but if you want high quality use a biscuit or dowel joint. Remember if you are using two pieces thick to not put two joints together. Stagger the joints. From an end view incorrect looks like ├────┼────┤ four pieces meet at one point. Correct would look like ├────┬─┴────┤

, Tape the paper down and use a pushpin to make a small indentation following the line every inch or so for large radius' and straights and 1 every 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) or so for detailed areas. Play connect the dots with a pencil after removing the paper to get the shape of your body and the body cavity

, Finish it up with a drum sander. (remember the faster you move your wood on a drum sander the better the result. Always use quick repetitive motions.)

,, (If you are using a hardwood you MUST use a band saw to cut close to the outside of your pattern or the bit will grip the wood and destroy your guitar as well as possibly injuring you. Make sure the bearing is touching the pattern and go the correct direction for your router/bit. GO SLOWLY. Don't worry about burning the wood your going to have to sand it anyway.

, Don't do the neck yet, we'll get to that later. Before routing the cavities use a drill press to remove a good amount of wood to make routing easier. (Remember the less routing on a guitar the less chance to screw up)

, Test it on the neck to make sure it fits perfectly. Once it does carefully align the neck template with the rest of the body (THIS IS IMPORTANT it must be lined up accurately!). Use double sided tape to stick the template to the body then route the same as the pickup and body cavities.

,,, Next look up how to wire and install the electronics and output jack and the bridge. You may want to colour it.

Choose a guitar pick with a thickness of 0.7 mm (0.028 inch) or above.,
Strengthen your fretting or picking hand.,
Do pull-ups.,
Practice strumming your guitar.,
Play frets up and down with alternative picking technique.,
Practice using specific fingers (index, middle and pinkie).,
Practice with particular scales.,
Practice regularly.,
Combine the strengthening exercises with other techniques.",How to Increase Your Speed Playing Electric Guitar," The thicker pick will provide a stable feeling when you playing fast. Practice with your picks regularly to make sure you feel comfortable with them.;
, There is a range of ways to do this effectively, as explained in the following steps.

, This may look weird but it does help to strengthen your hands and your muscles.

, Just as runners have to run every day, guitarists have to keep their hands moving every day. This exercise is not about speed, but is about your hand's endurance. At first, you may think this is not necessary but give it a try. Can you keep strumming all eighth notes at 120bpm in 5 minutes?


Do this daily. The help from metronome to maintain the tempo is optional.

, The aim of this is to make your fretting fingers faster and your picking fingers get used to alternative picking technique (pick up and down, up and down, up and down continuously while you are playing). Here is the example (in this example, you use all four of your fretting fingers):


E|--------------------------------------------------
B|--------------------------------------------------
G|--------------------------------------1--2--3--4--
D|--------------------------1--2--3--4--------------
A|--------------1--2--3--4--------------------------
E|--1--2--3--4--------------------------------------
---------------------
E|--4--3--2--1--------------------------------------
B|--------------4--3--2--1--------------------------
G|--------------------------4--3--2--1--------------
D|--------------------------------------4--3--2--1--
A|--------------------------------------------------
E|--------------------------------------------------

, This is the same as the example above. You may edit the notes in order to practice your fingers one by one. Here is another example :


E|--------------------------------------
B|--------------------------------------
G|--------------------------------------
D|--------------------------------------
A|-------------------3-----3--4--3--4--6--
E|--3--4--6--4--6----6-----------------
---------------------
E|-----------------------------------------
B|-----------------------------------------
G|--------------------------------------3-
D|---------3----3--4--3--4--6--4--6---
A|--4--6-----6---------------------------
E|-----------------------------------------

, The idea of this step is also same as other previous steps. You now practice with common major, minor and pentatonic scales. For example (E Major scale):


E|-------------------------------------------0---2---4---
B|-----------------------------------0---2---------------
G|---------------------------1---2-----------------------
D|-------------------1---2-------------------------------
A|-----------0---2---------------------------------------
E|---0---2-----------------------------------------------
--------------
E|---4---2---0-------------------------------------------
B|---------------2---0-----------------------------------
G|-----------------------2---1---------------------------
D|-------------------------------2---1-------------------
A|---------------------------------------2---0-----------
E|-----------------------------------------------2---0---
--------------
(G Pentatonic Major Scale)
E|-------------------------------------------3---5---
B|-----------------------------------3---5-----------
G|---------------------------2---4-------------------
D|-------------------2---5---------------------------
A|-----------2---5-----------------------------------
E|---3---5-------------------------------------------
--------------
E|---5---3-------------------------------------------
B|-----------5---3-----------------------------------
G|-------------------4---2---------------------------
D|---------------------------5---2-------------------
A|-----------------------------------5---2-----------
E|-------------------------------------------5---3---

, This is the key to effective fast playing.

, There are a lot of techniques that can help you improve your speed when playing guitar, such as hammer on, pull off, legato and sweep picking. However, sweep picking might not be easy for beginner players.

Turn down the gain on your amp or guitar.,
Reduce the volume on your guitar.,
Lower the treble, turn up the bass.",How to Get Rid of Feedback From Your Amp1," High gain on a guitar is a common culprit for feedback. Max gain increases the input signal until the output reaches maximum levels.If it’s too high on either your amp or your guitar, it could be creating feedback.


There should be at least two knobs on the face of your guitar. One of these should be the gain. Turn this counter-clockwise to reduce the gain.
You can keep the gain at three-fourths max or less on both your amp and guitar to prevent feedback. If you are still experiencing it, try turning it down even lower.;
, Try turning down the volume on your guitar knob while turning the volume on your amplifier up. This will increase the output while decreasing the input and could prevent feedback. You should always try to alter the volume of your music by your amp, and not with the guitar’s knob to prevent instant feedback as soon as you plug in your guitar.


Another knob on the body of your guitar should control the volume. Turn this counter-clockwise to reduce your volume.
Some guitars have numbers, 1-10 to designate the level of sound. If yours does, turn it to 8.
If the knob on your guitar is not working, see if you can buy a replacement knob at a guitar store. If that doesn't work, you may have to take it to get repaired.

, High treble and low bass can create feedback. Make sure that the levels that you’re playing create the most robust sound while eliminating any feedback. Test this by playing notes on your guitar while adjusting each knob separately.


All amps are different so you will most likely have to change the levels on your amplifier a couple of times to see what works best.

"
"
Point your guitar away from the face of your amplifier.,
Turn your amp so that the front is pointed towards the wall.,
Move further away from the amp.",How to Get Rid of Feedback From Your Amp2," Jimi Hendrix made feedback popular by playing his guitar in front of his amp.This is actually the main way that feedback can be produced when you play music, so make sure that your instrument or microphone is not picking up the noise from your amplifier.


Even though your amplifier may not have a direct line to your input, it’s still possible that sound-waves are bouncing off reflective surfaces. Move things like tables and chairs to eliminate reflective surfaces that may be bouncing sound back into your input.

, Pointing your amp towards the wall may stifle the sound but it will also prevent any feedback. Because sound-waves won’t be directly playing into your input, it’s unlikely that you will get feedback.


Pick up or roll your amplifier towards a wall and leave around 2-3 inches from the amp and the wall.
Putting your amp on a carpet instead of a hardwood floor will reduce reverberations throughout the house.

, Even if you're not pointing your instrument or microphone directly into the amplifier, your inputs could still be picking up sound waves produced by amp. If you have a long enough cord, move further away from the amp.


Put the amplifier in front of you, pointing outwards. This will also help you if you are on stage and are experiencing a lot of feedback.
Buying a longer cord will allow you the freedom to move around while you are playing.

"
"
Lower the effect on distortion pedals.,
Use an equalizer to turn down the frequency on the channel that has the feedback.,
Purchase a noise suppressor pedal.",How to Get Rid of Feedback From Your Amp3," If you have a distortion pedal plugged into the amp, that could be the source of the feedback you're hearing. Distortion or effect pedals can create feedback when the effects are turned too high. Try turning down both the level and the gain knobs.


Certain pedals are capable of creating more feedback. Overdrive effects for heavy metal or hardcore music have a greater chance of creating unintended feedback than a blues or jazz pedal because of the intended sound.
Try unplugging your guitar from the pedal and plug your guitar directly into the amp. If there is no feedback, then the pedal is your culprit.

, If you have an equalizer, you can turn down the frequency range for the guitar that you have plugged in. This will effectively eliminate all feedback because it won’t register through the equalizer.External or add-on equalizers may be more effective at eliminating your feedback. Depending on the quality of your amplifier, an external component may be better quality than the one that comes with your amp.
Electric guitar frequency range is 80 Hz to about 1200 Hz.You may have to test different frequencies for your specific guitar.
Lower the frequency by turning the knob counter-clockwise within your range.

, A noise suppressor is made to eliminate feedback, humming, and any other unwanted noise that is coming from your amp. This pedal does not affect the guitar's natural tone, but does cost money. If you absolutely can not get rid of your feedback, or want a cleaner sound on your guitar, this is an option.


Turn the noise reduction knob clockwise to reduce the ambient sound and feedback from the guitar.
Play with the threshold knob until you do not hear static from your amp. You have to find the level for your specific guitar and amp.

Jam the string down between two pickups.",How to Get a Guitar to Sound Like a Screamer1," Sometimes this works, sometimes this doesn't. Interesting effect if it does.;
"
"
Try octave harmonics.,
Remove your finger while simultaneously picking the string.,
Experiment with other places on the neck to try this.",How to Get a Guitar to Sound Like a Screamer2," Choose any string and pick it open. Just lightly touch that string at the twelfth fret.

, (Use this effect with a bass guitar to emulate the bells when playing AC/DC's ""Hell's Bells"".) This is a natural harmonic.

, The 7th fret is a good place to start. You'll always have to pick the note 12 frets after the one you begin with, so for the 7th fret, lightly touch the 19th fret.

"
"
Do the same as above, but instead find a harmonic point on the string and touch it with the side of your picking hand thumb.",How to Get a Guitar to Sound Like a Screamer3," Do this with the least amount of surface area you can.

"
"
Get a guitar with a floating bridge (like those made by Floyd Rose or Kahler).,
Use a finger (the middle works well) on your left (fretting) hand to flick the G string.,
Pull the bar upwards to ""dump"" the string into a massive dive bomb.,
Slam the bar down, bringing the pitch up and abruptly tightening the string.",How to Get a Guitar to Sound Like a Screamer4," These are the kind made famous by the great Eddie Van Halen.

, This performs the same duty as picking, but your picking hand is currently grasping the whammy bar behind the bridge (not over the strings) in swung around position.

, Place your finger directly over the fifth fret (the actual fret), just above the loosely flapping string.

, As the string tightens, it should snap into your finger, producing a very clear harmonic squeal as it rapidly rises in pitch. When you've got this down it only takes a moment to get squealing, and then you can hold the note, pushing the whammy bar to the limit. This can be done on any string, at any fret, but it's easiest at fifth fret G. Attempting this with a non-locking tremolo bar can result in your guitar going out of tune or may cause broken strings. Avoid using poorly made, though licensed copies of reputable name gear (e.g. Floyd Rose copies).

"
"
Grasp the pick in your strumming hand.,
Hold your pick between your thumb and index finger.,
Find a grip that works for you.,
Pivot your wrist toward your guitar.,
Brush the strings, don't scoop them.",How to Hold a Pick1," Most people are most comfortable strumming and plucking a guitar with their dominant hand, while fingering specific notes and chords with their non-dominant hand. Hold the guitar, interact with it, and work out a grip that feels comfortable.


Place your non-dominant ""fingering hand"" along the neck of the guitar, with your thumb holding the back of the neck and your fingers resting on the strings. The strings should face away from you, roughly perpendicular to the ground. Rest the body of the guitar on your knee, or use a shoulder strap to play standing up.
Rest your arm on the top of the guitar--the curved ridge along the narrowest edge of the body--and swing your hand down to rest on the strings. If you're using an acoustic guitar, rest your fingers on the strings over the hold; if you're using an electric guitar, rest your fingers on the strings between the last fret and the pickup bar.;
, Cover roughly half of the pick with your your fingers--some picks are molded with a groove to indicate where your thumb and forefinger should fit. Use a firm grip, but loose enough that you can allow the tip of the pick to bend .Don't hold the pick too loosely, or it might fly out of your hand.

, There is no ""right"" or ""wrong"" way to hold a guitar pick, but you there are certain grips that emphasize control, tone, and comfort. Consider the ""O"" method, the ""pinch"" method, and the ""fist"" method.


Use the ""O"" method. Hold the pick between the pad of your thumb and the side of your index finger, and form your fingers into an elongated ""O"" shape. This grip balances control and tone.
Use the ""pinch"" method. Hold the pick between the pad of your thumb and the pad of your index finger. This method may be best for those who use thinner-gauge picks and spend most of their time strumming.
Use the ""fist"" method. Hold the pick between the first joint of your thumb (below the pad) and the side of your curled index finger, near the first joint. This method is often favored by bluegrass players, and it may be best for heavy picks., The flat tip of your pick should rest gently on a string, and the long side of the pick should be as perpendicular to the string as possible. The angle of your wrist is essential to the picking process: when playing guitar, you are not really picking with your fingers, but your wrist. Flick your wrist up and down to strum and pick riffs, solos, and strings.

, Use the pick to brush the surface of the strings: not so gently that the sound is weak, but not so roughly that you're catching the string on the pick. Be firm, but gentle. Try to work with the instrument rather than imposing your will upon it.


Be fluid, and don't grip your pick too hard. You need to be loose and flexible with all of your motions. If you are too rigid, your picking will sound rigid and off rhythm, too.When you strum, you may keep your wrist fairly rigid as you brush the pick across the strings. Ultimately, finger-and-wrist technique is only a tool to enable you to play fluidly. When you find a method that feels comfortable, build upon it.

"
"
Strum your guitar with a loose wrist and elbow.,
Pluck your guitar.,
Alternate picking up and down to gain speed, precision, and accuracy.",How to Hold a Pick2," Strums are full, multi-string sounds that form an integral part of most guitar rhythms. Hold the pick between your thumb and index finger, and rest the tip of the pick gently atop the thickest, uppermost string (usually tuned to E). Brush the tip of the pick along the strings, from thickest to thinnest, and make sure to hit every string along the way. Strum quickly to blur the notes together, and slowly to enunciate each tone; strum gently for a quieter chord, and apply more pressure for a louder sound.


You can strum up-down (high, thin strings to low, thick strings) or down-up (low, thick strings to high, thin). You can strum any section of strings (say, 2-4, or open G to open E) for desired effect.
Try holding certain strings to form chords when you strum. The strum is a versatile part of any guitar player's repertoire, and the better you get, the cleaner your strums will get. Make sure to hold down strings tightly when you finger notes and chords, and don't be discouraged if your chords come out muted and sloppy at first. Build your finger strength and keep practicing.
Again: thinner picks generally make for a gentler, quieter strum, and thicker picks generally generate a heavier, more powerful strum.

, Sometimes, you'll want to pluck just one string at a time, whether you're playing a simple melody or just emphasizing a single note from a longer chord. Rest the tip of your pick on the string as if you were strumming, but only hit the single string. Strike the string with the pick, but sharply pull the pick away from the neck of the guitar so that you don't accidentally strike any other strings.


You can keep a chord formed with your non-dominant hand on the neck of the guitar, then pick a single note--or several notes in succession--from that chord. Try maintaining chord ""forms"" when transitioning between strums and plucks so that you don't need to shift your non-dominant hand so dramatically.
Plucking a note makes it more distinct. Especially on acoustic instruments, you may not be able to achieve the same volume or ""weight"" with a pluck that you can on an electric instrument. Use plucks to make space between your strums.

, As with strumming, you can pluck upward or downward. Try to create a flow between strokes: pluck down, strum up, strum down, pluck up. Make your playing efficient--it takes more time to strum down twice (returning up in between) than to strum down and then back up.

"
"
Pick your sound.,
Consider pick materials.,
Use specialized picks for certain instruments.,
Consider learning to pick with your bare fingers.",How to Hold a Pick3," Most brands of pick are sold by thickness: they are often labeled ""thin"", ""medium"", or ""thick"", accompanied by a millimeter measurement. Most plastic guitar picks are available in sizes ranging anywhere from 0.4 millimeters (mm) to 3 mm. Try starting out with a medium pick, between 0.60 and 0.80 millimeters thick.Thin picks usually range from 0.40 to 0.60 mm. They are best-suited for acoustic strumming, and other situations when you want a treble-heavy tone. Thin picks are often used to fill in the rhythms and mid-range in rock, pop, and country songs; however, they lack the heft for rock rhythm and lead.
Medium picks range from 0.60 to 0.80 mm. This is the most popular pick thickness: it's a good combination of stiffness and flexibility that works equally well for acoustic rhythms and powerful leads. Medium picks aren't ideal for zingy strumming nor powerful lead lines, but they are versatile.
Heavier picks--really, anything thicker than 0.80 mm--generate a heavier sound. At the lower end of this range, you’ll still have enough flexibility for crunchy rhythms, but you’ll also have the firmness you need for full-bodied chord arpeggios and fat lead lines. At the thicker end of this range, above 1.5 mm, you'll get increasingly cleaner, mellower, warmer tones. Your sound will become deeper more bottom-heavy: the thickest picks, from 1.5 to 3 mm, are used by jazz and metal guitarists.

, Most cheap guitar picks are made from plastic, and this should suit your purposes at first while you pin down the basics. Don't worry if you wear down the edges of a plastic pick; just use another pick.You may also find heavier rubber or metal picks that are designed for practicing or for specific styles of playing. Consider using a metal pick for a higher-pitched sound, or a rubber pick for a thicker, heavier sound.
If you aren't sure, try out a few styles of pick before you commit. You can find guitar picks at most music stores, certain music-culture boutiques, and online. Try out friends' picks and note the thickness, brand, and material. Figure out what works for you: a pick is personal choice.

, Banjo players don't use traditional guitar picks--they use finger-picks (different from plucking with bare fingers) that clip to your fingertips to facilitate plucking. If you're using banjo finger-picks, consider visiting a banjo technique website or asking around at a music store. In general, banjo finger-picks slip over the tips of your index, middle, and ring fingers, with a sharp fingernail-like ""pick"" curving backward from the pad of your finger over your fingernail.

, Many guitarists find it easier, at first, to use a plastic pick. The tips of your fingers may grow raw if you try to pluck or strum without a pick, but you may find that finger-picking greatly improves your range and speed when playing complex melodies.


If you try to play with a pick and then switch over to finger-picking later on, it may take you anywhere from a few weeks to a few months to regain the level of dexterity that you're used to. Consider starting out with finger-picking if you think that you'll switch at some point.
Use the pads of your fingers to pick upward (high strings to low), and use the nails of your fingers to pick down (low strings to high). Use several fingers to strum for a fuller sound.
Practice, practice, practice. If you are committed to learning to finger-pick, don't ""cheat"" and use a plastic pick. Take every opportunity that you can to improve your technique. Play riffs and songs slowly, all the way through, and build your speed.
When you become quicker and more confident in your finger-picking practice, try plucking two strings at once--or even three. Use your fingers to develop complex melodies.

Once the body is standing alone, unscrew the screws and knobs on the front of the guitar. Remove the screws on the pickups and bridge of the guitar.If there is a faceplate over your volume knobs, you'll have to remove the plastic portions of the knobs before you can lift the faceplate off.;
, Once all of the screws are out on the face of the guitar, you can lift up your bridge and pickups, which are connected by wires. Snip these and solder them later when you put your guitar back together. If you feel unsure about taking your guitar apart, take it to a guitar store so that they can safely do it for you. Make sure all the electrical wiring is removed from the guitar before you start painting it.

, Set your heat gun or hairdryer to the lowest setting and move it back and forth, across the body of your guitar. The heat from your hairdryer or heat gun will soften the finish on your guitar and make it easier to lift up the paint. Continue heating the paint for five minutes and then use a sharp tool to poke at the paint. If the paint feels soft, you can go onto the next step.Do not hold the heat gun in one spot for too long or you may burn the wood that's under the paint.

, Start by scoring a small location on the softened paint. Use your putty knife to lift off the old finish and don't worry if it cracks off. Continue to scrape the paint and remove the old finish without damaging the wood under it. If the paint isn't coming off, use the heat gun again to soften it. Once you're done removing the finish, you should see the wood grain under it., Use a 100 grit sandpaper at first and sand over the surface of the guitar's body in the direction of the grain. Sand down irregularities so that the body of the guitar is as smooth as possible. Follow the contours of the guitar and sand the sides and edges of the guitar as well. Once you've sanded it with the 100 grit sandpaper, you can move to a 200 grit sandpaper to sand out smaller irregularities.Use a sanding block if the sandpaper is hurting your hands.

, As you sand down your guitar, you're likely to find bumps or divots in the body. Fill divots that you can't sand down with an automotive filler. Once the divots are filled, let it dry for at least 20 minutes so that the automotive filler can cure.Bondo is a popular type of automotive filler., Once you've filled in all divots and the guitar is relatively smooth, you'll have to do one last sanding with the 100 grit sandpaper. Continue to sand until the automotive filler lies flush with the body of the guitar., Don't saturate the wood grain on your guitar to prevent moisture from getting absorbed into to the guitar. Take a microfiber cloth or a clean rag and wipe over the surface, making sure to remove any sawdust or debris that might be on the guitar.


Debris or dust left on the guitar will get sealed into the paint job.

, Lay down drop cloths under the guitar so that the paint doesn't stain the surface that you're painting on. Alternatively, you can hang the guitar from the ceiling and spray it as it's suspended in the air., You can purchase wood sealer online or at a hardware store. Purchase a water based wood sealer that has a high gloss. If you are painting your guitar a lighter color, use a white sealer and if you're painting it a dark color, apply a gray sealer., Saturate a dry rag in the sealer. Once the rag is saturated, drag it along the grain on the surface of your guitar. Make long movements and do not scrub in a single area with the sealer. Once the back of the guitar is sealed, turn the guitar over and finish sealing the front and sides.Once your rag looks dirty, dispose of it and use another, clean rag.

, Let the sealer dry for an hour or two and come back and apply another even coat of sealer. The sealer will help the colored coats of paint adhere to the body of the guitar much easier. Continue adding more coats of sealer until you've covered the guitar three to five times in total.Remember to let the sealer dry in between each new application.

, Feel over the sealer to make sure that it's no longer wet or sticky. Make sure that the guitar dries in a well-ventilated area so no one gets sick from the sealer's fumes., Using a 200 grit sandpaper, carefully sand over the shiny parts of the sealer. Make sure not to sand too hard or you may expose the wood grain underneath. If you do do this, simply reapply more coats of sealer to the guitar and allow it to dry before moving on. When you're done, the guitar should have a dull white or gray color., Typical guitar paint includes polyester, polyurethane, and nitrocellulose. Polyurethane and polyester will result in a harder, more plastic-feeling finish on your guitar while nitrocellulose is lighter and thinner. If you're unsure of what kind of paint to get, look for spray paint that's made specifically for guitars., Position the nozzle on the spray can 12 to 18 inches (30.48 to 45.72 cm) away from the body of the guitar. Remember to cover the edges of the guitar. Press down on the button on the spray can and go in long, sweeping back and forth motions across the body of the guitar., Touch the surface of the guitar to make sure that none of the paint transfers to your hand. The paint may still be sticky and you'll still be able to see the sealer under the basecoat that you just sprayed., Once the guitar is dry, flip it over and spray down the other side of the guitar. You should now have one solid basecoat of paint over the front and back of your guitar., Allow each coat of paint to dry for five minutes before applying the next coat. Continue flipping the guitar over so that the entire guitar gets even coverage. Continue to cover your guitar in coats of paint until the paint gets darker and richer. This could take anywhere from three to seven coats of paint., Once you're done laying down the base color for your guitar, you'll have to let the paint dry for another one or two days in a well-ventilated area. Once it's completely dry, you can move onto the next step. , Once the color coat is dry, run your fingers over the surface, sides, and back of the guitar to see if the paint is smooth. If the paint rises too high in some spots or has become bumpy, you should sand it down with a wet sandpaper. Saturate the sandpaper in water overnight, then work it along the rough parts of your guitar while it's still wet.Wet sandpaper will not scratch the surface of your guitar.

, Clear lacquer paint will give your guitar a shiny finish over the paint. You can purchase clear lacquer paint at a home improvement store or online. Spray the clear lacquer the same way you sprayed the base coat, putting four separate coats of lacquer on the guitar and letting the paint dry in between sprays., Don't touch your guitar for three weeks as the paint dries. During this time the paint will cure and should be a rich solid color, but will be missing the polish that guitars typically have., Saturate a rag or cloth with car polish and work it on the surface of the guitar using small, circular motions. This should refine the shine in the guitar and make it more reflective. One you're done polishing the guitar, it should be shiny and reflective."

Pay particular attention to the sound of the guitar.,
Consider the wood your future guitar will be made of.,
Choose a guitar that suits your budget.,
Try out the guitar or guitars you are interested in.",How to Distinguish Electric Guitars," For example, if you play folk, blues, jazz, or singer-songwriter music, you will want an acoustic guitar. If you play hard rock or metal, you will need an electric guitar.;
, Narrow down your search to the group of guitars suitable for the genre or genres of music you play.


Electric guitars can either have a hollow or solid body.

Hollow body guitars are used in most genres, but they are primarily used in blues and jazz. They have pickups (which is the difference between a hollow body and acoustic guitar) but also a good low-gain sound (although not at a level of high distortion). They are also known as semi-acoustic guitars.


There are many different variations of solid body guitars. For example, the Stratocaster, designed by Leo Fender, which first appeared in 1954, is the favored guitar of such legends as Jimi Hendrix, Ronnie Woods, and Eric Clapton, just to name a few.
Fender-style guitars (like Stratocaster and Telecaster) have their necks bolted into the body, while Gibson-type guitars (like Les Paul or SG) have glued necks. Stratocasters are made out of ash or alder and use single-coil pickups. See the Tips section for the difference between ash and alder wood.

Stratocaster is popular because it was the first guitar to include a whammy bar (tremolo bridge), which is very lightweight and therefore easier to maneuver.
The Telecaster is the oldest solid body guitar made by Fender. There are many similarities with the Stratocasters, such as the wood it is made of and the construction of the neck. But this guitar has two single-coil pickups, which gives it a very clean sound. It is an excellent instrument for country and rock music. The Who favored this guitar.
The Gibson Les Paul is probably the best solid body guitar. Because it is made out of mahogany, it is usually heavier. But it is also a very versatile guitar and comes in many different models. The Gibson Les Paul has two Humbucker pickups and is made of mahogany. Artists such as Zakk Wylde, Slash, and Jimmy Page use the Gibson guitar.
You might also want to consider the Flying V and Explorer models, which are suitable for rock and metal music.



, For example, there are two different kinds of bridges: tremolo and non-tremolo. There are also different kinds of frets such as a jumbo or extra jumbo fret. Once you have this knowledge, you will be able to make a better decision.

, The sound depends mostly on the guitar’s pickup.


Notice the placement and magnetic power of the pickup. Then again, if you buy a high-quality guitar, you can assume that the pickup will be of high quality, too.
The single-coil pickups on a Fender guitar sound good and are very powerful, but the sound produces more noise, as compared to Humbucker pickups, which can be found on different Gibson models.

, The kind of wood a guitar is made of has a major effect on the tone and consistency of the sound. Guitars are typically made out of one of five different types of wood:


Mahogany is heavy but provides a warm sound with more sustainability and density; it is great for rhythm guitar parts and solos such as Slash’s. These guitars, however, are heavy and hard to continue playing during a long gig.
Basswood is one of the best kinds of wood for guitars. It is much lighter than mahogany and its sound carries more treble. It is cleaner and “creamy.” Basswood guitars are very good for progressive and instrumental. It is often used for solos. Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, and John Petrucci of Dream Theater play basswood guitars.
Alder wood is a little bit heavier than basswood. Alder wood guitars have more sound sustainability. It is appropriate for thrash and other forms of heavy metal music. Alexi Laiho of Children of Bodom and Metallica’s Kirk Hammett use guitars made of alder wood.
Maple is not a very popular wood for the body of a guitar, but is mostly used for the guitar’s neck. Very few musicians play guitars with a maple body.
Ash is also a wood used infrequently. It is mostly used for Stratocasters. Ash wood guitars emit a sound that is something between the warmth of mahogany guitars and the clean sound of a basswood or alder wood guitar.

, You don’t need an expensive guitar, especially if you are just beginning to play.


You can purchase a guitar for $300-500. Keep in mind, however, that cheaper guitars may have their quirks.

, It is important to have firsthand experience with the look, sound, and feel of a guitar before purchasing one. The best way to do this is to go to your local music store, since it will have the most variety. You can also try out a friend’s guitar. Or if you are buying a used guitar from a private seller, find a way to get your hands on that guitar before purchasing it.

Play to check your work.",How to Install Guitar Pickups," These are on the back of guitar or is the pickguard assembly such as on a Stratocaster. You will need to detach any wires leading from the pickguard assembly so you can easily replace any pickup or or other hardware.;
, There is a small amount of solder from the hot and ground wires from the pickup that you will be replacing. To remove them you need to touch the solder with the soldering gun and pull the wires apart. Don’t forget where they were because you need to know that when you place in the replacement pickup. If you need to, draw a basic schematic if you cannot get a wiring diagram., Take out the two screws on either side of any old pickup. Now gently remove it, making sure you leave enough lead wire for both positive and ground. Be certain you keep the springs, screws, and any pickup cover.

, Unless you want to try “fishing” wires through precisely drilled holes, taping a guide string or small gauge wire to the ends of the hot and ground will save you much frustration and time.

, When you buy new pickups they come with a wiring diagram. Use this diagram to distinguish which color represents the hot and ground. Then tape those wires to the guide string if needed. Be sure to pull gently or you may rip the wires out of the guitar.

, Once you have placed in the new wires and have enough lead wire, solder them to their necessary places.

, Secure the new pickup by doing the opposite of taking it out and replace all electrical covers; make sure you have firmly placed them in level so there is no room for distortion in sound.

, If you can hear a signal, congratulations! You have just installed your first replacement pickup. If you cannot get any signal, go back and find a problem by referencing your diagram.

Figure out what kind of guitar you have.,
If you have an electric guitar, the industry standard is nickel wound.,
If you have an acoustic guitar, determine if it requires steel strings or nylon strings.,
Nylon strings have a soft, mellow tone and are easy on the fingers.,
Pick ball-end nylon strings, frequently called ""folk nylon,"" if you want to become a folk guitar player.,
Get Monel strings if your fingers are strong enough to handle the metal strings.,
Select silk and steel for finger-style playing.,
Pick bronze strings for finger picking on a folk guitar.,
Buy a set of brass strings if you want your tone to be sharp and harsh.,
Get flat-polished strings if you desire ease of playing.,
Select flat-wound strings for any electric guitar.,
Make sure to get the correct type of strings for your guitar.,
If you are playing using alternate tunings, you may wish to get a set that will retain the same tension in that particular tuning as a set tuned to standard.",How to Choose Guitar Strings," This will dictate whether you need electric guitar strings, acoustic steel strings, or nylon strings.;
, The most common gauge is 10-46. See Ernie Ball Regular Slinky or D'Addario EXL110. These are the most popular electric sets and provide a great starting point.

, Your guitar is built for one or the other. String gauge. If you want a thicker tone, choose a heavier (thicker) string gauge. If you want easier string to play, choose a lighter gauge.

, You will stay with them if you decide to play classical guitar.

, They are a little heavier than regular nylon and take vigorous strumming.

, They have a much sharper and louder tone than nylon. thickness varies according to the type of set purchased; medium-light gauge is recommended for beginners. Do not use them on classical or electric guitars!

, They are much easier on the fingers than the regular metal strings. Do not use them on electric guitars because they will not pick up electricity.

, They provide brilliance in sound. Select light gauge for finger-style playing, heavy gauge for strumming.

, They are usually more brittle than bronze.

, They are easier on your fingers than standard metal strings. These strings come for both acoustic and electric guitar.

, They are comfortable to the left hand and give a smooth tone when amplified. This string is preferred by many jazz guitarists. Flat-wound strings will provide a more mellow tone than a similar round-wound string, however will be harder to grip with your fingers during bends and fretting due to the smoother surface of the flat wrap wire., Acoustic steel strings( phosphor bronze, 80/20, etc...) have too high a string tension for a classical guitar and can damage it. Nylon strings won't vibrate the top of a steel string guitar enough to produce much sound. Electric guitar strings have a different composition than acoustic guitar strings to help the pickups function properly; specifically they have steel wrapping instead of bronze.

, For example a lot of metal bands use drop D/C/B/A tunings or D/C#/B standard tunings. For very low tunings choose a heavy set of guitar strings such as a 11. or 12. gauge set. Similarly if you play slide guitar in drop G tuning you would be better off choosing a set of strings which will have a high enough tension for you to play comfortably using a slide.

Wait on pedals at first.",How to Choose an Electric Guitar," Like an acoustic guitar, an electric is basically just strings that vibrate over wood, but with the addition of all kinds of confusing-looking selector switches and knobs. Learning to identify the basic components of electric guitars can help demystify the process and help you focus on the most important parts.Pick-ups will be placed under the strings near when the guitar is plucked. There may be as few as one pick-up and as many as three or four, depending on the guitar. These are used to pick up the sound of the guitar, which vibrates an internal magnetic coil, producing an electric signal that travels through the amplifier.
Volume knobs will be included, sometimes as many as three. These allow you to adjust the output volume of the guitar.
Tone knobs are used to toggle between the high and low frequencies in the pick-up. There are usually different tone knobs for each pick-up in the guitar.
Selector or cut-off switches are used to select between the individual pick-ups and activate them, or cut them off. On most guitars you can use some combination of different pick-ups.
The output jack is usually on the back-end of the guitar, or the bottom lip, where the guitar is plugged in to the amplifier via quarter-inch cable.;
, To the untrained eye, all electric guitars might look basically the same, but body styles can be broken into several basic categories, each with its own subtleties of sound and playing style. Some body styles work better for certain genres, though there's no rule that says so. Lots of it has to do with your personal playing style and the music you want to make.


Solid body guitars are sturdy and weighty, made of a single piece of wood. Because there's no resonance chamber, solid-body guitars must be played through amplifiers. The variety of pick-ups and the electronics of a solid-body guitar are very important. These are the go-to guitars for rock 'n roll, punk, and metal music. Famous solid-body guitar styles include the Fender Stratocaster and the Gibson Les Paul.
Hollow body electric guitars are, as the name suggests, hollow on the inside of the body. While there's no sound hole as will be found on an acoustic guitar, hollow-body electric guitars will often use a different variety of pick-up than a solid-body guitar. These are often used for playing jazz, featuring a warm and deep mid-range, and work best with mellow, low-volume amplifiers.
Semi-hollow body electric guitars are hybrid models that feature a cut-out design and a small hollow portion of the body. These guitars have a bright and chime-like tone that's perfect for country music, folk-rock, and for lead-guitar work. The Rickenbacker and the Gibson ES are famous semi-hollow guitar models.
Electric-acoustic guitars look basically like acoustic guitars, but feature pick-ups that allow them to be played like electric guitars. While these typically will have fewer features than other forms of electric guitars, electric-acoustics offer the versatility of playing them without the use of amplification.

, Primarily, the sound of a given electric guitar will come from the pick-up, though the pick-ups of a guitar can be changed out, customized, and upgraded. For a reason, it's important to give some consideration to the wood that the guitar is made from, but beginners will likely not notice a huge difference in sustain, so try not to be led down a garden-path by a salesman telling you that you have to upgrade to koa wood. Still, it's good to learn a bit about the different types of woods used to demystify the process.


Most bodies are made of maple, mahogany, or poplar. Maple is known for its long sustain and bright character, while mahogany is known for its warmth. Poplar is great for bright and crispy high-register tone.

, Let's face it, the number one reason most people end up picking the guitar they pick is because it looks cooler than all the others. This is a perfectly legitimate reason to pick a guitar. Almost every guitar player who ever picked up an axe did so because they saw some other guitar player who looked awesome standing on stage.


Famous Gibson Les Paul pickers include Jimmy Page, Zakk Wilde, Slash, Randy Rhoads, and Bob Marley.
Famous Fender Stratocaster players include Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Buddy Guy, and Stevie Ray Vaughn.
Other iconic guitar models include the Gibson SG, played by Angus Young, the Fender Telecaster, played by Bruce Springsteen, the Gibson Flying V, played by Kirk Hammett, and the Fender Jazz Master, played by Kevin Shields, Elvis Costello, Thurston Moore, and J Magic.

, Gearheads often fall into the same trap, thinking that super-expensive and obscure gear is also better than cheaper industry standard stuff. Sometimes, this is the case, but if you’re looking for a guitar to learn on, don't judge by the price. There are expensive guitars that have the resonance of a brick, and there are cheap guitars that really sing. Old Fenders that sell for thousands of dollars today started out life as inexpensive solid body guitars.


By the same token, if you're going to invest in a guitar to learn on, you need to get something that's worth playing. Toy guitars sold at places like Walmart aren't even worth the low price tags offered. It's better to go for a used guitar or a cheaper model of the guitar you want. Fender offers the ""Squire"" series, using somewhat cheaper materials, but the same designs as their other more expensive guitars. You can get a Squire Strat for around $300, compared with the $1400 it might cost for an American Stratocaster, if you're lucky.
Explore used guitars and do your research to find deals. Some players will only play guitars that have been broken in a bit and worked over by other players. Neil Young is known for only playing old guitars, for example, and never plays new ones.

, When you pick up the guitar, play up the fretboard a bit and hold out individual notes. When you pluck a string, you should be able to get a vibration in the wood that you can hear all over the guitar. It should last a few seconds.


The pickups can be changed for very little money, but the wood makes the guitar. Hold a note and listen to the sound decay–does the guitar have a long, warm sustain? Or is it short and metallic? This will depend on the wood and the installation of the neck, which affects the guitar’s sound in a big way.The guitar should also be in tune in both the 5th and 12th frets. Play up the frets and make sure that a barre chord in first position is in tune, and a bar chord up the scale is in tune. If not, the neck needs adjusted.

, The scale length refers to the length of the string as it actually vibrates, so it’s measured by the distance between the nut and the saddle of the bridge. The scale can be longer or shorter, depending on this length. What this means for you is comfort. You want to make sure the frets are a comfortable and playable distance apart. Most modern electric guitars are one of two basic scales:


Gibson scale is 24.75 in. This gives the Les Paul its round tone and its hefty bottom end. Anyone who's ever picked up a Les Paul knows the gravity of it. This is partially the scale.
Fender scale at 25.5 in. The Fender scale offers a clear and bright playability, great for leads and those Hendrix-style outer space explorations.
A 25″ scale is sometimes used by other manufacturers like PRS guitars, offering its own distinctive tone.

, Action refers to the height of the strings off the fret board. A “high” action means the strings are far off the board, making it require more finger pressure to play each note. “Low” action means the strings are just off the fret board, easier to press. When you play the guitar, pay attention to how far off the strings are and how difficult it is to play the individual notes.


Most used guitars will need to be set up, so a certain amount of string buzz can be fixed. If you’re buying a used guitar, though, you need to check for buzzy frets and consider getting the neck adjusted to properly raise the strings off the fretboard to the height you like.

, You have a number of nut widths, which set the distance from the E string to high E string. The other features the shape of the back of the neck.

, Primarily, the sound of the guitar coming out of the amp will be made possible by the pickups. When you're first starting out, you probably won't notice a huge difference, or might not care much about the pickups, but it's less complicated than it seems. Learning to differentiate between the two most basic and most common styles of pickup will help you make an informed choice. Some guitars will come with both styles, while others will have one or the other.


Single-coil pickups have a glassy tone, great for blues and rock and roll leads. These will be oval-shaped, and have little metal spots, one per string, under the guitars. Stratocasters come custom with single-coil pickups.
Humbucker pickups were designed as improvement to the single coil pickups, giving you more of a growl when cranked up loud. They're rectangular shaped and made of metal. If you plan on strumming and getting some distortion in your sound, you'll likely want a guitar with at least a humbucker pickup.
Some guitars will have different kinds of pickups, for example, P90 pickups were the most popular among guitarist, the sound that they have is that mean growl from humbuckers but a warm bass tone along with it. With distortion, these pickups had made a mark on guitar history.

, The bridge of an electric guitar will feature a number of different designs, some more complicated than others. Some “floating” bridges feature tremolo bars, also known as “whammy bars,” which allow you to bend the bridge and “dive” the sound accordingly. These can be customized but are standard on some guitars.


It's good for some players to notice where the bridge lays in relation to where you hand wants to naturally rest on the guitar. Some guitars look great but have somewhat sharp or awkward bridge-placement, which can make it a challenge to play comfortably. Likewise, some bridges have irritating string-guides, which can make restringing a challenge. It's a good idea to consider these topics when making a selection.

, An electric guitar isn't much good without an amp, which can be one of the hidden costs of the electric guitar purchase. Playing an expensive Gibson through a crappy practice amp doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Save enough room in your budget for a good quality amplifier to make that guitar you gave so much thought to sound great, as well.


Consider your needs and buy an amp with enough output for your purposes. Also check out the customizable features on each amp, including reverb, tremolo, and other effects which can be fun to play around with.
Solid-state amplifiers are the most inexpensive amps, based on semiconductor circuit models. For the beginner, these are usually fine purchases. More experienced guitar players usually favor more up-scale tube amplifiers, which feature vacuum tubes which need to be warmed up before putting a current through them.
Combo amps feature an amp ""head"" placed on top of a larger speaker. The Marshall stack is an iconic combo amp. These are usually used for performance and for putting out large amounts of sound. Unless you're planning on gigging in the near future, a combo amp is probably overkill.

, It'd be a shame to get home from the guitar place with a guitar and an amp and nothing to connect the two. Guitar cables are usually between five and ten bucks a pop, featuring quarter-inch jacks on both sides. Make sure you're getting the right kind of cable at the guitar place. Any good store should make sure you walk out with everything you need, but it's good to be sure.

, Picks, a guitar strap, and an electronic tuner are all essential electric guitar components. It's difficult to tune an electric guitar to anything, and most electronic tuners will allow you to plug straight into the unit with your quarter-inch cable, making it super-easy to adjust your sound and make sure your instrument is in tune. These can be as cheap as 10 dollars or so.

, The world of guitar pedals is vast and semi-complicate. Though there's probably nothing more fun than stomping on a distortion pedal and letting 'er rip, or channeling together a bunch of Echoplex pedals and vibrato units and making outer space symphonies without playing a note, it's probably an unnecessary investment when you're first getting started. Learn the basics and see what your amp is made of before you start messing around with guitar pedals.

These cables have a plug that fits into your input jack on your combination amp and is what allows the guitar to play through the amp's speakers. The guitar's jack should be on the front of the guitar or the edge of the guitar and will look like a metallic socket.Popular guitar cable brands include Planet Waves American Stage Guitar and Instrument Cable, Monster S100-I-12 Standard 100 1/4-Inch Instrument Cable, and George L's 155 Guage Cable.You can also purchase 1/4"" instrument cables online.

, Turning down the volume and the gain will prevent feedback and will stop you from blowing out your speaker when you plug in your guitar., Take the other end of your guitar's cable and plug it into the input jack on your amplifier.Your guitar should be directly connected to the combo amp with your instrument cable.

, Adjust the volume and gain knobs on your amp until your guitar reaches a suitable volume. You can test the volume of your guitar by strumming an open string as you adjust the knob on your amp.You can use the knobs on your instrument to reduce gain and volume as you play instead of having to walk over your amp.

, Test other knobs on the guitar like bass, mid, and treble knobs. Start these knobs off in the 12 o'clock position to give your guitar a default tone. Then, start to adjust the different knobs and play your guitar until it reaches the sound that you desire.Your combo amp may already have built-in distortions like overdrive. Test the different features of your amp.
If your tone isn't thick or full enough, experiment with bringing up your amp's bass knob.
If your guitar's tone is too muddy or muffled, consider turning down the bass and the mid while turning up the treble.
All amps are different, so there isn't a particular preset that you can use on all amps.

Get enough guitar cables.,
Plug your pedal into a power source or use batteries.,
Connect your guitar to a pedal using an instrument cable.,
Plug a guitar cable into the output jack of your pedal.,
Plug the cable from your pedal into the input jack on the amp.",How to Connect an Electric Guitar to a Combo Amp2," When using a guitar pedal, it's necessary that you use more than one 1/4-inch cable. When using more than one pedal, you'll need even more 1/4-inch cables. The cables used to connect your pedals together can be much shorter than the cable you use to connect directly to your amp.Cables can be as small as six inches long.

, Many pedals have replaceable batteries so that you don't have to plug them into an outlet. They also come equipped with an adapter that allows you to plug the pedal directly into the wall. Make sure that the batteries are fully charged on your pedal or that it's hooked up to a power source., Plug the instrument cable into the front or the side of your electric guitar. Then, take the other end of the cable and plug it into the input jack on your guitar pedal.

, Take another instrument cable and plug it into the output jack on your pedal. If your pedal is on the pedal board, make sure that you have a long enough cord to reach the amp.

, Take the cable hanging from the output jack of your pedal and plug the other end into the input jack of your combo amp. This will complete the connection and will allow your guitar's sound to be distorted before it reaches the amp.

Switch your combo amp on.,
Test the pedal by turning it on and off.,
Chain effects pedals together.,
Follow the right framework and order when using multiple pedals.",How to Connect an Electric Guitar to a Combo Amp3," Find the power switch for your combination amp and set it to the on position. Make sure that your amp is plugged into a power source before doing this. Check the gain and volume knobs on both your amp and your pedal before turning your amp on. Make sure that these knobs are all turned down, or you may get feedback when you plug in your guitar.

, Turn the pedal on and off by pressing down on it with your foot. There should be an indicator light that looks similar to the indicator light on your combination amp.

, When working with multiple pedals, you can connect them together to create various effects. Do this by connecting small instrument cables from the output of one pedal into the input of the next pedal. You can chain pedals like this to create different kinds of sounds, or to have different effects at your fingertips.Common pedals include tuner, reverb, overdrive, blues, and loop pedals., Some rules and techniques when chaining your pedals together can improve the sound. For example, tuner pedals should come first because pedals that alter the tone of your guitar may throw off the tuner. Pedals that amplify noise like overdrive, compressors and wah pedals should go next. Pedals that modify the tone, like chorus and tremolo pedals should go after amplifier pedals, and should be followed by pedals that adjust the guitars ambiance, like reverb or delay pedals.


Pedals that amplify the tone or volume should go before pedals that adjust or modify the tone, though you can mix this up to get some interesting effects."

Understand the four main attributes of a guitar pick:


The shape of the tip
The thickness
The overall size
The material;
,
Ask yourself if you prefer to play rhythm.,
Ask yourself if you prefer to play lead.,
Try out different gauges of picks until it feels right to you.,
PICK MATERIALS are also important.,
Which pick you choose depends largely on personal playing style and preference.",How to Choose Guitar Picks,",


In general, rounded tips are best suited for strumming chords and playing rhythm guitar.







,


Sharp picks are better for playing lead guitar. Lead guitar is primarily focused on playing one note at a time opposed to rhythm guitar which primarily plays more than one note at a time.







,


The thickness of picks are generally measured in millimeters (mm) and normally range from 0.38mm (thin) to 1.5mm (thick). Some guitar picks measure up to 3.0mm thick and beyond.






In general, thin picks are good for rhythm guitar but not great for lead guitar. Thick picks are good for some rhythm guitar and great for lead guitar.
Thin picks allow a guitar player to firmly strike the strings without much chance of breaking them or playing too loud. Thin picks bend easily and are designed to make strummed chords sound smooth.
Thin picks absorb the shock of playing chords better than thick picks, thus providing more comfort to those guitarists trying to prevent or treat tendinitis.
Thick picks give a guitar player more control of volume and attack on the strings. There is not much give, so thick picks don't bend very easily.







, Picks are commonly made out of various plastics (nylon, celluloid, Delrin, etc.), rubber, metal, wood and felt.

The most common are nylon and celluloid.
Rubber, metal, wood and felt are used for special effects. Metal is primarily used for heavy string playing, rubber to slightly dull the ""twang"" sound, wood for a more mellow sound, and felt for a very muted and low-volume sound.

, Try several and see which suits you best."

Identify the type of music you'll be playing (this will be essential when you make the choice on your new amp.,
Research different manufacturers of guitar amps, read reviews to get an idea of what you'll be looking for in an amp.

,
Start looking.,
Choose what type of amp you'll be looking for, different amps are suited for different styles of music, for example, you won't be wanting an Epiphone Blues Jr. for playing death metal.

,
Figure out what size of amp you'll be needing.,
Identify your price range, a half-stack will set you back easily over £500/$600, But a combo amp from the same company might be a couple of hundred cheaper.,
Find out whether you need effects for the style of music you're playing.,


,
Try some amplifiers out at a store until you find one that you like.,
Enjoy your new amp.",How to Choose a Guitar Amp,");
,, Once you have completed these first 2 essential steps, you can begin your search.

,, A 10 to 30 watt practice amp will be perfect for bedroom practice and rehearsals, but if you plan on gigging, then you'll need something with more power.

, It all depends on what it's being used for.


Tube or transistor or Modelling? Many musicians would argue that tubes provide a warmer, more vintage tone, compared to the harshness of transistor amps. It all depends what you prefer, many metal musicians prefer the harsh growling tones of a transistor amp, whereas a blues player may prefer the warmth and crispness of tube amplification. Tube amplifiers also cost a lot more than their ""solid-state"" counterparts, premium sound = premium price. One thing to bear in mind when making this decision is that tube amplifiers are fragile and they need a lot more upkeep than a transistor amp. Tube amps also can be very loud. Concerts at stadiums can be played with 30-watt combos, as 100-watts or more are needed for solid-state. Transistor amps are designed for the road and they can take one hell of a beating. Also the cost of replacement tubes when the old ones die is something to be considered too.

, A fully kitted out pedal board can cost a fortune, therefore many people turn to modelling amplifiers with built in effects to save on $$$. And if you're not aware what's your tone, then go with modelling amp as they provide many presets of different amps and you'll really enjoy playing and exploring tone that you like. Its kind of middle one between tube and transistor. Sounds like tube, and price and weight like transistor one!,, Or watch videos and reviews on YouTube. Once you find the one you want, be sure it's the right one. Smaller stores may offer an exchange if you take it home and you don't like it. Bigger retail chains might not be so kind.

, And don't harm the neighbours.

"
"
Start by picking your options.,
Don't worry about the myth about tube or solid state amps.,
Choose between combo or header and cabinet.,
For cabinets and heads, again choose your options.,
Keep in mind some ""don'ts"".",How to Choose an Amplifier," You can choose a new or a used amp, and sometimes it would be cheaper to by used gear, but remember that some used amps will have some kind of problem that you might find when you get it home that you will have to correct or live with.;
, A watt is a watt, with tube and solid state they're all the same. Just take notice that tubes will get hotter than you can hold them and will break often when playing, but solid state are almost the exact opposite but will get warm, and sometimes used amps have a very bad smell to them when they get hot inside.

, Combos have the head and speaker both in one, while it's opposite for headers and cabinets. It's easier to carry and practice with combos, and some will have every effects pedal you can imagine, but at a gig you'll have to mic it up to hear the full sound. Headers and cabinets are separate so you can switch any heads or cabinets to hear a different sound or even plug in two cabinets in one head.

, For the best quality and sound, choose between 10"" to 12"" speakers, they sound best because they vibrate and retract respectively when playing, and horns and subwoofers add for true bass and volume, so if you do see these on amps they can mean the amp is expensive.

, There really aren't any set rules to finding your perfect amp, but a few are ""don'ts"":


Don't play bass or bass notes on your or the store's guitar amps.
Don't use instrument cables to connect a head to a cab and vice versa.
Never plug in your guitar into a live amp that is on and connected to PA mixers and everything else.
Don't neglect to keep spare parts and spare amplifiers just in case.

"

Determine your budget.,
Select the right type of amplifier for your application.,
Browse for tube amps online before shopping in person.,
Demo several amps by going to a music supply store.,
Inspect the construction of the amp before your purchase.,
Consider purchasing an amp from a brand with a quality reputation.",How to Buy a Tube Guitar Amp," Tube amps are much more expensive than their solid-state counterparts, and therefore you may need to scale back your power requirement or increase your budget. A small 15-watt combo tube amp will easily sell for five times more than a comparable transistor design. To maintain a flexible budget, look for an amp with the least amount of power necessary for your application.
, The kind of tube amp you should purchase will depend on your use.

For a home practice amp, a small combo amp (one in which the loudspeaker, preamp, power amp, and controls are all housed in the same enclosure) is ideal. An amp with a single 10"" or 12"" (25 or 30 cm) speaker with wattage between 15 and 30 is a good choice.



 


For recording, a combo amp is also ideal, but you may need an amp with more power. Many professional recording artists record using a ""2x12"" amp - an amp with 2 12-inch (30 cm) speakers.






For live performance, separate speaker cabinets and heads will be ideal for achieving high volume able to fill a large venue. These setups are too large and loud for home use, unless you have a detached garage or isolated sound room.







, While demoing an amp is the only way to get a sure feel for its sound, browsing online has many advantages. It lets you read user reviews for particular amps, and it allows you to read about the amp's features and construction - things that may not be readily apparent when inspecting the amp in person.

, Actually playing through an amplifier is the best way to determine if it is right for you. Make sure to demo several different amps to establish a standard of comparison. If possible, demo the amps using your own guitar.

, Most amplifiers are built from plywood, and the thickness of the wood will play a role in determining the amp's sound and durability. Look for an amp made from at least 1/2 inch (12 mm) thick plywood, and stay away from any amps made from a lighter engineered wood, such as particle board.

, If the above steps aren't enough to help you make your decision, consider the brand name of your amp. Some manufacturers with reputations for building quality tube guitar amps are Vox, Fender, and Marshall.

"
"
Decide how much money you are willing to spend.,
Decide what you want to get.,
If you only want to use the amp to practice in your room, look for a combo amp with about 20-30 watts of power.,
If you want to use the amp for practicing with a band, you're going to want 60-140 watts of power.,
If you want to use the amp for small to medium gigs, you should buy a half-stack with about 200-600 watts of power.",How to Buy Your First Bass Amp," A brand-new decent quality practice amp will run about 100 dollars. However, if you can find one used, or on sale at a local music shop, go for that.;
, Once you have your money amount decided upon, it is time to think of what you want to use it for.

, Generally these will have an 8-inch speaker inside, but a 10-inch speaker is preferable. These usually cost around 60 to 150 dollars.

, A combo amp is still preferable in this situation, and a 10-inch speaker can be enough, but 2x10-inch speakers or a 12-inch speaker would be optimal. These cost about 180 to 450 dollars.

, A half stack consists of a head and a cabinet. Or, for easier portability, you can buy a high powered combo with 200+ watts of power which will help with transportation and setup. When purchasing the two, make sure of the impedance (ohms) of the cabinet, and the power rating for the head at that impedance. Make sure the cabs RMS rating is about the same as the head's power output at the impedance of the cab. A head can be solid-state or tube, the tube option tends to be less durable, but sounds better and is more expensive. A good solid-state head costs 200 to 600 dollars and a good tube head costs 500 to 1400 dollars. But don't think that you absolutely need to spend all your money, there are many good amps in smaller privately owned stores that may be used but pack a lot of punch for a much lower price. A cab in a half stack should be a 1x15, a 2x15, a 4x10 or a 6x10. For big, booming bass go with a 115 or a 215, if you want for a tighter, punchier sound, opt for a 210, 410, 610, or an 810. 115's and 215's are generally going to give you a very deep, solid rumble that you hear as much as feel. With the 210s and up, you'll get a lighter, punchier sound, but you won't get that unbeatable deep rumbling you get from a 115. If you have the option, spring for a head or combo with a speaker extension jack, if you have a 210 and up, connect a 115 or 215. If you have a 115 or 215, connect a 210 and up for better range of sound. If you have a more complex amp with a crossover feature, you can send the lows to the 15's and the mids and highs to the 10's.


But before you do anything, if you can buy a Combo with a 115 with an extensive EQ and anyone with a bit of knowledge can almost perfectly match the sound of a 410 or 610.

Determine which finger you will wear the slide on.,
Assess the fit of the guitar slide.,
Choose a slide with an appropriate weight.,
Determine how hard you want your slide to be.",How to Buy a Guitar Slide," There is no single correct way to wear a slide, but the most common position by far is on the little finger. While this can feel awkward at first, it frees up your other 3 fingers for fretting patterns behind the slide. It also makes it easier to fret chords while keeping the slide out of the way. There are several notable musicians, however, who play with their slide on a different finger.;
, Once you know which finger you will be using, try on the guitar slide. It should fit just snugly enough so that if you hold your hand relaxed at your side, the slide will not fall off. A loose slide will cause you to exert your muscles to keep the slide in place, which can lead to fatigue. You can adjust the fit of a loose slide by padding it with rubber, leather, or foam.

, The general rule when assessing a slide's weight is that heavier slides will produce a fuller sound with longer sustain. Thick, heavy slides will absorb less of the string's energy, a process that robs the sound of your guitar by converting that energy into heat. Heavy slides also minimize the dampening effect on the strings caused by your other fingers.


If you play an electric guitar, the effect of a slide's weight is much less noticeable. Even the thin sound produced with a lightweight slide can be adjusted through amplification and compression.

, Hardness is perhaps the most crucial aspect of a guitar slide, because its effect on tone is so great. Slides made from hard materials will have increased volume and sustain, but will emphasize high frequencies and string noise. Softer materials yield a more muted tone with a quicker decay, but also produce a balanced timbre with no over-emphasis of treble.


Soft slides, like those made from copper, are well-suited to playing styles that use a lot of strumming. Heavy strumming works well with the quick decay caused by these slides.
Heavy slides, like those made of stainless steel, are best used for soloing, and suit playing styles that utilize long, sustained notes.
The most versatile slides are those with a medium hardness, such as those made from brass, glass, or ceramic. These slides are a good choice for beginning slide players who may not know yet where their preference lies.

Make a frame with the wood pieces.,
Use a drill and some wood screws, and drill the frame together, one piece at a time.,
Choose the corner two pieces of wood first (the 1ft piece and the 4ft piece).,
Put the edge of the shorter piece on the edge of the longer piece, and place two screws in to connect the pieces together.

,Do the same process with the last corner, and finally complete the rectangular frame by drilling together the last two corners of the frame

,
Staple a poly sheet (a plastic cover for insulation) around the finished frame.,
Cut a piece of insulation so that it fits inside your frame.

,
Place the insulation inside the frame.

,
Cut the fabric so that you can fit the shape of your frame in the middle, leaving about 10 inches (25.4 cm) of space around that outline of the frame.,
Center the frame on the cut fabric.,
Hang this panel on a wall where speakers will be pointing at them to absorb the sound and reflect it in different directions and cut down on echos.

",How to Build an Acoustical Panel," Depending on what size and what shape you want the panel to be, cut the sides accordingly. For example, if you want to make a rectangle frame, you might cut two pieces of wood to 4 feet (1.2 m), and two other pieces of wood to 1 foot (0.3 m).;
, A simple way of setting the wood together is to place the wood on the ground in the shape you want to make.

, Stand both of them on their sides so that the long sides are flat on the ground and the short edge is pointing up.

,,, You are doing this because once you put the insulation inside the frame, you want to really seal the insulation in as well as you can.

,,, You are leaving this extra length so that when you are stapling it to the frame, you have enough room to really stretch the fabric over the sides and staple them to your frame. You can trim the excess later, if you wish.

, Pull the extra 10 inches (25.4 cm) of fabric and over the sides, stapling them to the wood, preferably at the back edge. Work around each side of the frame.

When computers became more popular during the 80's and 90's, amp building never looked backed to the simple tube amps. This is one reason why amp selection can be so wide and confusing.


For the beginner, you will need a decent priced and decent sounding amp that has a 12 (30.48 cm) speaker. You are looking for good, clean, and distorted channels at about 30 watts or more. Something like this could cost you a pretty penny, but if you go further down the road with your hobby and start to play live shows you will be getting the best sound possible.
;
, As stated before, there is a vast world in amp technology that is very different from those built years ago. What you need is two amps and possibly some back-up ones. Also stated before, you will need a decent priced and decent sounding amp that has a 12 (30.48 cm) speaker, looking for good, clean. and distorted channels at about 30 watts or more. Obviously, this is not the best sound possible for an intermediate player and an amp that matches the description should be used for practice and a back-up amp.


To achieve the sound best suited to display your music, you will need a 412 cabinet and a 60 watt or more header, also known as an amp stack. You need one that has good, clean, distorted channels, four perfect 12 (30.48 cm) speakers, and an optional foot selector switch.


, There are two types of physical amps, tube and solid state. Whatever you choose is up to you, tubes require a bit of maintenance now and then and solid state can be poorly designed at times. The only thing that makes them similar are watt and amp usage, common controls, etc. Cost is a major factor when you buy an amp, for beginners you do not need to spend over $300 (267.59 euro) and intermediates should not spend over $400 (356.78 euro).

, Once you found equipment you need and/or can afford, buy it. If you buy used gear, make certain it can last a long time so that it can get you to where you want to go.

, Every kind of amp available in the market is in your favor because of the way you play. Most amps are designed solely on the use of standard tuning with clean and distorted channels. Sometimes low budget amps somewhat distort a distortion channel when gain is set very high and it may be caused by poorly designed gain channels, which were invented after players in the 1950s turned up the clean volume to get a distorted sound and hearing loss. After distortion channels had made their way into amps they seldom changed and thus would explain some amps (mostly low-end and low wattage solid state) at times distort high gain settings.


If you're the type of player that plays in standard and/or drop-d, likes high gain and needs a budget amp, then you may need a distortion pedal and a possible booster that's connected to a clean channel. However, this problem rarely occurs in separate headers and cabs, mainly heads that are 60 watts or more hence that there are more ways to correct the problem.

, There is a lot to consider when simply trying to buy an amp. In fact, the matter is hard because it's based off of your own opinion, but some seem to find it easier than others. A few examples are tube or solid state, low-end or a few more bucks for a decent budget amp, etc. All features are a matter of opinion, but one thing to remember when purchasing any gear is to fit your general hobby or career, such as wrongfully getting a bass amp when you play mostly distorted electric guitar.

, If you find an amp that fits your budget, general guidelines, and your preference purchase it immediately or place a hold on gear you're thinking of getting. You certainly do not want to have someone else purchase the amp you carefully selected.

, There is a limited amp selection available in the market for you because of the way you play. Most amps are designed solely on the use of standard tuning with clean and distorted channels in which sometimes low budget amps somewhat distort the distortion channel when gain is set very high and you're playing below standard tuning. A lot of high powered amps correct this problem, but some do not. If you suspect an amp is doing this, first change your strings to a heavier gauge and see if it was only this. If not, you may need to turn up the volume and see if this corrects the problem. If it does not, you may need a better amplifier, but before you try to find a new one see if you can fiddle around such as play with the tone knobs on the amp to find a better sound.

, There is a lot to consider when simply trying to buy an amp. Because it's based off of opinion and all features are a matter of opinion, one thing to remember when purchasing any gear is to fit it to your general hobby or career.

, With the way you play you add more natural bass to your overall tone, most amps cannot take this and simply give out on what matters most or they have a hard time getting all the extra tone under user's control. A way to correct this problem is with 2 or more speakers and higher wattage for your amplifier. When looking for such amps it is a good idea to try them out first and then see what you can do about purchasing options.

, As stated above, if you find an amp that fits your budget, general guidelines, and your preference purchase it immediately or place a hold on gear you're thinking of getting. You certainly do not want to have someone else purchase the amp you carefully selected.

If you are a complete beginner, learn the basics of your instrument before trying to ""cover"" your favorite song.,
Listen to the Song over and over.,
Get the Tab or Sheet music for the Song.,
Break the song down into small sections and tackle a section at a time.,
This is VERY important: start out playing a section of music VERY SLOWLY.,
When you get used to it, try playing along to a CD or tape.",How to Learn a Song on Guitar That You Want to Play," That means you should be comfortable playing open chords like E, A, D, G, C and F, both the Major and Minor versions. You should also be able to play a simple scale such as a pentatonic or blues scale. Any basic guitar book will show you how to do this.;
, The more you listen to song, the more you memorize the parts you are learning, and when you are learning you will know what they are supposed to sound like. If you aren't sick of hearing that song yet, you haven't listened to it enough times.

, These are where you will get the notes and chords for the songs. If you do not know how to read these, then start learning! At bare minimum learn to read tab. It's easier than you think and it will pay off. Note: if you have never heard of ""tab"" it is short for ""tablature"" which is a form of music notes that is easier to read because it is laid out exactly as you would see it on your guitar.

, Start off by learning only about four bars at a time. Don't be tempted to skip ahead to the other parts of the song, as you will have to come back to the other parts then. Practice each bit until you are happy with it, then continue to the next few bars. Again, if you are not completely sick of playing the part, you probably haven't practiced it enough times.

, It's more important that you get the rhythm consistent and even than that it be fast. Fast will come later after you've played the song hundreds of times. Only speed up when you can easily play the piece with consistent and even rhythm at your current speed. This is the most important secret of learning any instrument, and it's the reason most people quit before they get good. They are too impatient to play it slowly until they really get good at it, and they expect to be instantly great. Put in the time and speed up only gradually and eventually your friends' jaws will drop when they watch you play that awesome song.

, This will help you get the rhythm of the song and help you get used to the tempo. Keep in mind: The proper rhythm is every bit as important as the notes.

"
"
Learn the basics first: no matter what type of music you want to play or what type of guitar you want to use, you will need to learn some basic chords, they are extremely easy to find on the net and there are many books covering this sort of thing,also, YouTube has tons of videos for this.,
Make sure you enjoy learning.,
Find a buddy to play with.,
Don't get ahead of yourself: The chances are, if a song sounds hard to play, it probably is (not all the time though) so take it slowly, don't try to learn an entire song at once, try to learn a group of five or six chords on a song at a time, if you try to go too fast you'll only get confused and frustrated, then you'll get nowhere.

,
Practise regularly: It's a lot easier to practise if you set a certain time to practise.,
Stock up on supplies.,
Buy a tuner.",How to Learn Guitar Without a Teacher," (YouTube guitar lessons are a great way to self teach);
, No matter how hard you try, if you don't enjoy learning, it will make it far harder. Play the music you like, most bands have at least a couple beginner songs, so try to play songs that you enjoy playing.

, It makes it a lot easier to learn if you play guitar with a buddy, you can compare tips and both play different roles in different songs (providing you have the same taste in music)e.g they could play lead and you could play rhythm, plus it is really fun to play the same song with someone.

,, 45 minutes to an hour each night is good, but stop if you feel bored or tired. Start fresh the next night(or day). Its also a good Idea to keep your guitar set up so you can just pick it up and play if you have a spare couple of minutes.

, Make sure you have a good supply of picks/plectrums (if you are using a pick instead of finger picking)and make sure you always have a spare set of strings in case one snaps (nothing more annoying than not having a string)

, Having a guitar tuner is much better than trying to tune by ear, they are much easier to use and take much less time, it is very annoying if tuning by ear does not work, I was close to smashing a guitar over it.

Run through the following pattern using all of your fingers to work on single-note speed.",How to Increase Your Speed and Finger Strength on the Fretboard," Think about pushing your index finger and thumb together, like you were snapping. Now just put the neck of the guitar between your fingers. You want to be able to squeeze your fingers up against your thumb for the best power, allowing your whole hand -- not just your fretting fingers-- to provide strength.






;
, You don't want to angle it forward because this makes it impossible to push hard on the frets. You don't want to angle it towards your body because this makes it hard to quickly reach the top of the fretboard.








, The further away from the fret you are, the harder you have to work in order to hold the string down. You'll be much faster and more efficient if you place your hands right behind the fret. By behind, this means towards the head of the guitar. So, if you're right handed, you want to be just to the left of the fret you're playing.








, Your vertical finger placement, or how high you place the tip of your finger when barring chords, will change from person to person. One of the best ways to increase finger strength is to figure out how you can hold all six strings at once and get a clear, consistent sound. Practice quickly barring notes, removing and placing your hand as fast as you can while playing all notes clearly.









The joints in your fingers might make it hard to play some strings. But this is why you need to adjust how high your index finger goes -- don't just assume that you must have the tip of your finger on the top string.
Experiment with putting the bar on first, then the shape of the chord, and vice versa. Neither strategy is right -- just find out which method works fastest for you.

, You're just going to rotate your finger slightly to make it work. If you're right-handed you'll tilt your hands just slightly to the left, towards the head of the guitar. The harder surface will require less power to hold the string down, making it much easier to get perfect chords and notes quickly.








, This takes the weight off of your arm, bringing the weight of the guitar towards the center of your body. With less weight to support, you can easily get more power and speed through your arm. You want to tilt from the wrist, not your elbow. Keep your elbow in, towards you body, instead of flaring it out to the side.








, Move your barre up every single fret, picking it up and placing it down. Once you can do this easily, try it with a full barre chord, moving it up and down the neck. This builds the forearm and finger strength needed to play quickly.









If you're struggling at first, try to use a second finger to help hold down your barre. As you gain strength you can take it off.

, Once you get barre chords, move on to open chords. Play a G, remove your hand, then play a C. Alternate back and forth, adding new chords in time with the metronome. Then alternate between barre chords and open chords to take your playing to the next level.








, While most of your speed comes from practice, there are things you can do to your guitar to make it smoother and easier to play. Getting a guitar serviced by a professional will make practicing more enjoyable, as it makes the strings easier to play. You should consider:










Lower-Guage Strings: This means the strings are thinner, meaning they take less power to hold down and can thus be played faster. Your sound will get slightly tinnier and softer.

Lowering the Action: The action is the distance between the strings and the fretboard. There is little reason for a lot action -- this usually means the guitar is long overdue for servicing.

, You might ""feel"" faster, but you'll never actually know unless you have a metronome to help keep track of time. Keep track of your times and speeds, starting around 60 BPM and moving up when you're comfortable. After running through the exercise a couple times at the previous session's speed, push the tempo faster by ten beats per minute and continue practicing each example until you feel comfortable with the new speed.









Always play at a speed where you can hit every note cleanly, not just hit every note. It doesn't help to play quickly if half the notes are missing.

, Using down strokes, up strokes, and alternating strokes, practice this at a tempo that you are able to manage, but fast enough that you cannot do it for long before your fingers tire. Try to do the following exercise, up and down the fretboard, once with up-strokes, once with down strokes, and once with alternating picking:
e----------------------------------------5--7--------------
B---------------------------------5--7--------------------
G--------------------------5--7---------------------------
D-------------------5--7----------------------------------
A------------5--7-----------------------------------------
E----5---7------------------------------------------------









, Hammer-ons and pulls-offs are ways to sound notes without actually strumming them. This means you can strum a different note, or just squeeze in an extra note between picking. Both techniques use your fretting hand to sound out notes right on the










Hammer-Ons are when you quickly slam your finger down on a string, right near the fret. You should hit it hard enough that it sounds out. It will be a bit quieter than a normally picked note.

Pull-Offs require two fingers on the same string -- try your index on the 5th fret and your ring finger on the 7th. Keeping your finger on the 5th fret, pick up your ring finger, ""picking"" the string with your ring finger at the 7th fret.

Using Both: Pick a note normally, using your index finger on the 5th fret. Then hammer down on the 7th fret to make it sound out. As you finish, pull-off the 7th fret -- you've only picked one string, but you've sounded out three notes!

, As always, try to play with an accurate tempo and clean articulation. You want each note to be clean, clear, and precise. The fastest playing in the world sounds terrible if every other note is missed or off.








, Take the following exercise only as quickly as you do it without mistakes. Make sure you use a metronome to keep yourself on time. As soon as you get to the end, turn back and do the whole thing backward again -- you need to get speed and strength moving both directions. As you get better, work on new picking patterns, add hammer-ons, and make the metronome faster.

, Your playing should reflect back to the song.

, Basic knowledge of music theory is essential for successful improvisation. The more you know, the easier it will be.

, Are you improvising to a 12 bar blues? Is it a salsa piece? Or funk? Swing? Knowing what rhythms are distinctive for each genre of music will help you express the piece, and also help you get into the piece yourself.

, When playing in E minor you could play part of ""Mary Had a Little Lamb."" Audiences love to hear traces of a well known song mixed in with a surprising and new beat. In fact, there is a Latin version of ""I've Been Workin' on the Railroad."" New takes on old ideas are always good.

, What are you going to play at the chord switch or the turnaround? Be prepared for every subtlety, and know what to do at every switch.

, You don't have to shred for the full solo; in fact (in most cases), you shouldn't. Blues pieces often require slow, smooth licks more than tremolo picking.

, If you are playing jazz, chances are there's a ""head,"" or main theme that you will refer back to after the solos. Make sure your notes sound good with the background parts, especially if you're playing with a big band (which might consist of trumpets, trombones, saxophones, drums, bass, and guitar). Also, it's good to incorporate different genres of music into your solos, but maybe that Phrygian scale you just learned sounds horrible with the rhythmic funk that your band is playing.

, Just let it rip, baby!

, Every soloist has hit a bad note; it's how you learn what sounds good.

, It's good to experiment with what sounds good on your own, but after practicing improvisation with other people, you should become fluent enough in music theory, scales, and chords to know what will sound good. At some point, everything should just come naturally. You don't want to be surprised by anything while performing.

, Have one for each genre that you're interested in improvising with, and make sure it's adaptable for new songs. It's perfectly acceptable to play a blues scale if you're improvising over a 12 bar blues; just make sure your rhythms match what everyone else is doing.

, If you followed these steps, they may even say yes.

Once you get better at guitar and can read tab try checking out websites for backing tracks (http://www.guitarbackingtrack.com/) which are fun to practice with.

,
Also for learning the guitar check out these website: http://www.all-guitar-chords.com/ http://www.freeandeasyguitar.com/.",How to Learn Guitar for Free," The hollow part of an acoustic and the solid part of an electric is called the body. The long thin part is called the neck. The fretboard is the flat part where you put your fingers. And the frets are the lines going across the fretboard. These are very important when it comes to where to put you fingers.;
, If your guitar has been laying around untouched for a while It's most likely out of tune. http://www.howtotuneaguitar.org/ is a great place to do this. Just match the sound of the string with the sound of the tuner. You'll want to tune in standard to learn in because that's how most songs are written in.

, http://chordfind.com/ is practically an online chord book. Figure out how to play some of the major chords like D, G, C, A , and E along with D minor, G minor etc.

, Download a free tablature program such as TableEdit, PowerTab, or tuxguitar. With one of these programs you will not only see where to position your fingers, but also be able to hear the song so you can learn the tempo. As your skills develop you may wish to graduate to a more advanced tablature program such as GuitarPro. Guitar players normally are too lazy to learn how to read music so they invented guitar tab. You can find a Monster load of guitar tabs at www.ultimate-guitar.com this site pretty much has every song you can think of and makes buying a tab book totally pointless.

, Many people quit when their fingers hurt. When your first starting out your fingers have to build calluses. This you can't help, so take breaks and continue through. Nylon string guitars will be gentler on your fingers than steel strings.

, Guitar Players sometimes have weird nails. Their left nails are to be as short a possible without cutting themselves (so their nails don't get in the way of their playing) and some finger pickers grow their right nails long to use them as picks.

, You will learn more chord voicings easier playing with your fingers. A great song to learn how to finger pick on is Green Day's ""Time of Your Life"". It definitely takes some time getting use to.

, Hear a song you'd love to play then find the tab for it. Take it slow at first but once you get the feel for it try playing with the song or even singing with your own playing

,, These are just a few sites that are very helpful and if you don't find what you need there scour youtube for the song or try to find tabs for your song here: http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/

Seek out guitar tabs.,
Learn to read guitar tabs.",How to Learn Guitar Online2," Tabs are great if you just want to learn some great pop or rock songs that you can play to impress your friends. The internet is full of guitar tabs, though they sometimes take a bit of hunting.


To find popular tab sites, plug “Guitar Tabs” into your favorite search engine.
If you already have a tune in mind, you could also search, “Guitar Tab” on that same search engine. If the song is relatively well-known, dozens of options should come up. Try to choose one that is highly rated for accuracy (for instance, five stars or 100% ratings).;
, A tab is kind of like sheet music but primarily is only used for guitar and bass notation. It represents progressions as fret numbers instead of as notes. The main problem with tabs is that, unlike sheet music, there is no indication of rhythm, so it definitely helps to know the rhythm of the song before you start learning it.


Check out How to Read Guitar Tabs for more details.

Pick a site with easy-to-read scale charts.,
Start practicing scales during every session.",How to Learn Guitar Online3," There are dozens of sites offering to teach scales to the novice guitarist but not all are created equal. Find the one that works best for you (again, use that handy search engine to get started).


Clearly labeled notes are essential. You should understand what notes you're playing, not just what frets you're playing.
Many scale sites also describe what music the scale is traditionally used in (for example, E Minor Pentatonic shows up in dozens of rock solos).

, Every guitarist will tell you that a grasp of scales is inherently useful. While some people pick scales up naturally over time by just hearing what sounds good, it helps to have a legitimate knowledge of numerous scales.


Scales, whether you realize it or not, are the fundamental building blocks of solos. A good soloist knows what notes to play next because they have practiced scales so much.

"
"
Find a suitable website.,
Decide what theory to concentrate on.",How to Learn Guitar Online4," Again, finding the website you want to use is half the battle. Your favorite search engine will come in handy again, though music theory is a bit more touchy than scales. Make sure that you are at a reputable site, as amateur music theory can set you on the wrong track and cause problems in your knowledge that take a long time to correct.


There are plenty of great free resources out there; if a site wants you to pay, make sure it's not knowledge you could get elsewhere.

, If you think learning an instrument is overwhelming, try learning music theory. The entirety of music theory would take a lifetime to master. However, there are some fundamentals that everyone should know.


Learn chord progressions. A chord progression is any sequence of chords, and some sound better than others. For instance, the chords G-C-D sound pretty great together on guitar. Learning chord progressions will explain to you why those sound good together.
Rhythm and time signatures are also good topics to get started with. Basically, you're trying to learn why certain music sounds good, and then applying that knowledge to producing your own good music. Theory often gets ignored by people who just want to learn a few songs, but if you ever want to make music then you should have at least a basic understanding of theory.

Use silence strategically.,
Vary your timing.,
Utilize vibrato.,
Do pull offs and hammer ons.A lot of the core to guitar soloing is made up of pull-offs and hammer-ons.,
Slide your fingers.,
Practice tremolo picking.,
Build up to something.",How to Improvise a Solo on Guitar1," Some guitar players don’t realize the effect of adding a rest, or silence, to their solo.A rest in a guitar improvisation is a good time to recollect your thoughts and decide where to go. Listen to some of your favorite solos and you might notice that the guitarist isn’t playing nonstop.


A good way to employ a rest is by using your palm to mute the strings. By doing this, you can resume playing with your picking hand quickly.
A rest is commonly used at the end of a guitar line, or a succession of notes across the fretboard.;
, Timing, or the speed at which you play a solo, can offer a variety of effects. Many beginner guitarists feel inclined to play a guitar solo as fast as they possibly can. While many soloists do play fast, it is oftentimes more interesting for a soloist to modify the timing to create a better feeling for the solo. The mood of the solo will be reflective of how the soloist speeds up or slows down during a solo.


For example, you can begin a solo at a quick pace, but then slow it down once you hit a harmonious note or melody.
There are plenty of interesting and sometimes overlooked effects you can do with the speed and variety of timing used during a solo.

, Vibrato is when the pitch of a note bends. There are effects that produce this sound, but you can also achieve it using your fretting hand. Hold a note with your hand and bend the note back and forth quickly. The result will be a vibrato sound. To increase the stamina of your fretting hand, position a couple fingers above the finger that is holding the note.


By using multiple fingers, you’ll be able to bend the string farther and for a longer period of time.
Vibrato is a technique that is utilized at any given point of a solo. Play around and use it once you hear a note you like.

, Pull off is when you pull your finger off the string so that the open string (or another note you have positioned) rings out. Hammer on is when you slam (or hammer) your finger onto a string. Both hammer ons and pull offs allow you to quickly play a note without having to pick the string.


Use a combination of hammer ons and pull offs to execute a quick melody.
Flatpicking guitar is heavily made up of these techniques.

, Another staple of the guitar solo is the slide. Sliding on the guitar is an easy technique, but must be used tastefully. Slides are commonly used to begin or end a solo, but you can also employ them in the midst of a solo. Hold a note on a string and slides your finger up or down.


You can build your fingers strength and even slide chord shapes.

, Tremolo picking is when you use your pick to play exceptionally fast. The name refers to the similarity in sound that is produced with the tremolo effect. Do this by alternating between downstroke and upstroke with your pick. Practice this slowly until you become comfortable.


It might be hard for a beginner to control where the pick goes. This all takes time and practice.

, Understanding when and where your solo will end is extremely important to a successful improvisation. Knowing how long you'll be improvising means you can successfully bring the solo to a peak - with techniques like playing faster or in a higher register as the solo draws to a close. This gives your entire solo a strong feeling of intention and helps you finish strong.


This technique also implies knowing to start things off a bit slower. Allow your solo to breathe in the beginning then build in intensity as it goes along. Make sure you have ""somewhere to go"".

Learn scales.,
Consider and vary your approach.,
Play in a vertical approach.,
Play in a horizontal approach.,
Learn all the octave patterns.,
Practice soloing in multiple keys.",How to Improvise a Solo on Guitar2," Almost every solo is performed around a scale of some sort. The most common scale for soloing in rock n’ roll music is the pentatonic scale. Once you know how to play a scale, you can change which key you play in by changing the starting note. This is helpful because you don’t need to relearn the same scale based on a different key. Utilize patterns for while you’re playing as much as possible.


Other important scales to learn are the minor pentatonic, blues, natural minor, major, and the chromatic scale., There are two different approaches to a guitar solo: vertical and horizontal. The vertical approach is when you solo according to the current chord. A horizontal approach is when solo according to the current or relevant scale. The best players utilize both of these practices., Consider the measure of the song you are going to solo over and make sure you know all the chords. Once you know all the chord shapes, you will be able to select notes out of each chord. This technique is called wrapping chords. Pick out notes from whichever chord is being played and pair those notes with notes from a neighboring chord.


For example, if the song is made up of E, A, and D, you can pick out various notes from these chords during the measure.
You can add variations to the sound by including neighboring tones. A neighboring tone is a note that is a half step below or above the note you’re playing.
Jerry Garcia, for example, utilized neighboring tones in his solos.

, A horizontal approach has a few more options for playing than the vertical approach. For most chord patterns there are multiple scales that can be played to add different moods. You are usually safe to play a scale in the key of the root note. The root note is the key of the song. For example if the song is in the key of C, you could play around a C major, pentatonic, or blues scale.If there are chords that contain notes that are not in the scale you are playing, you’ll need to accent those notes. Like the vertical approach, it helps to know the chord shapes and each note in the chord.
Some common scales to play in a solo are the major, harmonic minor, and melodic minor scales.

, Voicing is a powerful tool for a soloist. The voice of the sound refers to the octave you are playing at. Start small and try to identify each “E” on your fretboard. You can use common patterns like skipping a string and playing a step up. Try hard to ingrain into your memory where each note is.


In the midst of improvising, you can benefit from switching the voicing to alter the sound of your solo.
A commonly overlooked octave for soloing is the lowest register. This voicing sounds great after playing in a high register for a bit.

, You can’t practice too much when it comes to playing an instrument. This is especially true if you plan to take a lot of solos. An easy way to practice is to challenge yourself by changing the key of your solo. Many guitarist are comfortable soloing in E and A, but can they solo as well in Bb?


Apply the same type of practice to each key to best prepare yourself for playing with other musicians.

"
"
Utilize call and response.,
Use motifs, repetition, and the main melody.,
Listen to your bandmates.",How to Improvise a Solo on Guitar3," Call and response is popular is several styles of music. It uses conversation as a metaphor for playing music. One way to utilize call and response is by accenting certain notes during a solo in response to what other musicians' are playing. Another is to create a ""call"" on your instrument and have your band respond with a unified ""response"".This technique is also called ""question and answer"" in jazz improvisation and can be used within your own solo. Pose a ""question"" with a series of notes, then ""answer"" that question with your next series of notes.

, A great way to bring all the musicians together during a solo is by playing a motif of the song. A motif is a repeated melody that is usually a short phrase. The motif could be from a riff during the verse or might even be part of the melody from the chorus. Repeating the motif during your solo is a good way to indicate to your band to change something.Oftentimes the main melody from the song acts as a motif and indicator to the other musicians.
You might use it to speed up the band, slow the tempo down, change into the verse, or even end the song.
For an example of a band's relationship with a motif or main melody and repetition, listen to John Coltrane's version of ""My Favorite Things.""

, All musicians should keep one ear focused on what they’re playing and the other ear focused on the band. One part of listening is centered around keeping an eye out for signals or cues your bandmates might physically give off. Even while you are soloing, it will help you to occasionally glance up and check in with your band.A guitarist that overplays and doesn’t consider the rest of the band is a bad guitarist. It’s important not to overstep your solo and keep the mood in a unified spirit.

Choose a guitar.,
Buy an amp.,
Buy some picks.,
Buy strings.,
Learn to understand tablature, often shortened to ""tab"" or ""tabs"".,
Learn from examples.,
Tune your Ax.,
Learn about key.",How to Get Started Playing Hard Rock and Metal Guitar," The better the guitar, the better the sound. And that means it will be easier and more fun to learn on. That said, it isn't at all necessary to go out and spend tons of money on a nice axe. Don't spend less than $200. There are a lot of poorly made beginner models out there that could just end up leaving you frustrated.


For Rock, an entry level Epiphone (by Gibson) or Squier (by Fender) model guitar is a good idea to start with. If your budget can handle it, Fender and Gibson have famous names on the headstock. They make instruments the way they made them in the 50s, 60s and 70s.
For metal, some good brands are B.C. Rich, DBZ, Dean, ESP, Jackson, and Ibanez. If you're old school, Gibson and Fender clones can also be used for metal.
Now, you may be asking: what's the difference between a rock guitar and a metal guitar? The most important difference is in the pickups. Heavy metal guitars tend to have ""active pickups"", while rock guitars usually have ""passive pickups"". Go ahead and look up the difference.
Remember, just because a guitar has passive pickups doesn't mean you cannot play metal with it. Vice versa, just because a guitar has active pickups doesn't mean you can't play rock with it.;
, Get something small (no more than about 30 watts, no less than 10) to practice with, and spend no more than 100 dollars on it. It should be a ""combo amp"". You don't need to pay much heed to this term, but if you're curious, look it up elsewhere. Anyway, you can move to higher-end models later once you are more experienced. Line 6, Crate, Epiphone, Fender, all make decent entry level amps. Fender, Vox, and Marshall make higher-end tube amps, among other companies as well. Read on to find out what the difference between tube and solid-state amps is.


There are two types of amps: Solid-state and Tube. Solid-state amplifiers are much, MUCH cheaper, and are recommended for a beginner. However, some metalcore and metalcore guitarists prefer solid-state amps because they can sound very harsh (doesn't always apply to cheap entry-level amps).
Tube amps (also known as ""valve"" amps, especially in the UK) are frequently used by professional rock musicians, and a large percentage of heavy metal players use tube as well. Unfortunately for the beginner, they much more expensive than solid-state amps. Tube-driven amps are widely considered to sound highly superior to solid-state amps. They are definitely not recommended for a beginner, as they do require maintenance and care must be taken when using them; they are quite fragile and can be costly to repair.

Special note: Some amps use a combination of Tube and Solid-State technology. They are often a good choice for the amateur guitarist who has moved beyond the beginner level. They sound far superior to entry-level Solid-State amps and are a lot cheaper than fully Tube amplifiers.
Another special note: ""tube"" does NOT refer to the shape of the amp.



, Get lots and lots of these. You're going to be losing them, I promise. No guitarist can avoid that, so have backups. Get some with a thin to medium thickness and some that are heavier. You will probably find you like one more than the other. Once you have found a preference, buy primarily that type of picks. Jim Dunlop makes great picks of all thickness.

, Guitars are nothing without good strings. Investing in these will produce awe-inspiring sound.


D'Addario and Ernie Ball strings are the most commonly used strings for both rock AND heavy metal. It's mostly a matter of personal preference.
Keep in mind the string gauge when buying strings. String gauge refers to how thick the strings are. When people refer to string gauges, they usually use the gauge of the high E string (the 1st string). For example, if you buy strings that are .009 gauge, that means that the 1st string gauge is .009 inches (0.0 cm) thick. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Strings#Electric_Guitar for an accurate list of string gauges.
The thicker the string gauge, the more bass you can hear and powerful-sounding the strings will be, but it will be more difficult to do string bends. A string bend is when you bend the string so you can change the pitch of the note. The thinner the string gauge, the easier it will be to do string bends, but the strings will sound more like treble. Make sure you try many different kinds so you can figure out what suits you best.

, Tablature is a system that uses numbers to represent positions on the fretboard. Remember, the 1st string is the one closest to your feet when you play, and the 6th string is closest to your head.


The long lines represent the strings:

E (1st)---------------------------------------------
B (2nd)---------------------------------------------
G (3rd)---------------------------------------------
D (4th)---------------------------------------------
A (5th)---------------------------------------------
E (6th)---------------------------------------------



, Here is a tablature staff telling you to play a note at the 3rd fret on the 6th string, then a note at the 6th fret on the same string, then a note on the 3rd fret of the 5th string, and finally two notes together - 2nd fret 4th string and the fifth string open (not fretting any note). Whenever notes are shown directly over or under other notes, all of them are played together as a chord.


E (1st)---------------------------------------------
B (2nd)---------------------------------------------
G (3rd)---------------------------------------------
D (4th)-------2-------------------------------------
A (5th)-----3-0-------------------------------------
E (6th)-3-6-----------------------------------------

, If you don't know how to tune the guitar, buy a tuner. Everybody uses them anyway, because tuning by ear is impossible for a beginner. If you cannot get a tuner, use a pitch pipe or some point of reference to:


Tune the fifth string to A.
Then match the sound of the 5th fret on the 6th string to the open A.
Match the D string to the 5th fret of the 5th string.
Match the G string to the 5th fret of the 4th string.
Match the B string to the 4th fret of the 3rd string.
Match the high E string to the 5th fret of the 2nd string.

, Key, is a big mystery to a lot of beginners. It's going to remain one too - because we aren't going into the swamp of music theory here. Next is this nifty chart which will tell you what fret (position) you can play your pentatonic scale at over any chord and stay in key. If this confuses you, remember that the scale starts on the 6th string, and the first note in the pattern is the root. Even if you skip the 6th string and start playing on the 4th, whatever fret you started on is your position. If you started anywhere on the 5th fret, you're playing in the key of A, etc. Still confused? Have a look at this:

Determine what notes you are using, and try to figure out what scale you are using.,
Decide whether you're using a major, or minor key.,
Use the scale constructed in step 2 to determine the key your riff is in.,
Write down the notes of your scale, and write the scale intervals (Roman numerals) underneath each in order.,
Decide what interval you want to harmonize in.,
Using the list you wrote in step five, write the notes down again, adjusting them for the interval you chose.,
Using this finished list, play the riff again, playing the notes that are underneath the original notes.

",How to Harmonize a Riff," Memorize it and the pattern.;
, The best way to do this is to construct a scale using the notes you used, and ascend with notes that sound ""nice"". This will become easier with experience.

, In general, major keys will sound happy and upbeat, while minor keys will sound sad (although this is not a hard and fast rule, a minor key can certainly sound happy). Also, metal songs will generally use minor keys.

, Ex: Your riff uses the notes Eb, F, Ab, and D. You determine the other notes to be C, G, and Bb. You know now that your riff is in either Eb Major, or C Minor. You decide to use C Minor.

, Ex: You write C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, and C. Under the first C, you write ""I"", under the D you write ""II"", under the Eb you write ""III"", and so on until you reach the second C, where you put ""I"" once again.

, Thirds are the most common, as they usually sound the best, and are the easiest, however sixths and fourths can also sound very good, and even a second or seventh can sound good, used sparingly.

, Ex: You decided to harmonize in thirds, so you write Eb under the first C, F under the D, and so on.

Change or decorate the pick guard.,
Hang something from the headstock.,
Add stickers.,
Get a flashy strap.,
Trick out the toggle switches.,
Write a slogan on your guitar.",How to Decorate a Guitar1," The easiest and most reversible way to give your guitar a little flair without damaging the instrument itself, or spending a lot of money is to get a new pick guard with interesting colors, or to get a plain pick guard and decorate it with markers or paint.


On electric guitars, most pick guards can be removed with a small Phillips-head screwdriver, after removing the strings. Replacing it is as easy as placing it and replacing the screws. Pick guards are available at any guitar shop or music store.
Acrylic paint and permanent markers are the simplest and best ways of decorating pick guards, and the bodies of guitars. There's more info about painting your guitar in the next section.;
, Jerry Garcia used to stick a rose in between the strings on the headstock of his guitar, and a variety of little decorations hanging from the headstock or the tailpiece of your guitar can look pretty cool.


Try getting a few scarves or attractive looking scraps of fabric and wrapping them under the strings at the headstock, and knotting them tightly.
Wrap some strings between the tailpiece and the strap of your guitar to keep it held in place.

, Another super-easy and effective way of decorating your guitar is to use a variety of stickers placed around the body of both electric and acoustic guitars. While some people think these negatively affect the tone woods and the resonance of the guitar, the difference is difficult to notice, and not significant on cheaper guitars anyway. All of the following make great guitar decorations:


Band stickers
Bumper stickers
Logos
Stickers along the fretboard

, Leather strap with a psychedelic mandala? Lightening bolt? Bandolier of bullets? A cool strap can do just as much for your general stage presence and vibe as a cool decorated guitar. Shop around online for cool options, or consider making your own.


Adjust strap to an appropriate rock and roll height. That means low, if you're in a punk band, and nipple-high if you're in an indie band.
Apply buttons of your favorite bands to the strap. This is also a good opportunity to rep independent record shops, bookstores, tattoo parlors, and head-shops in your town.

, Most electric guitars come with plastic toggle switch caps that you can remove and replace with any number of oddities, or leave blank for a more punk, or industrial look. Most knobs should have a solid metal inner knob that you can use by itself, or trick out with whatever you want to use.


Pop the volume knob off your guitar and replace with a die that you've drilled a hole in, then glue it to the metal rod. Other cool options might include clay balls, lego men, or prescription pill bottles.

, ""This machine kills fascists"" was famously written on Woody Guthrie's guitar, and Willie Nelsons guitar Trigger is autographed by hundreds of famous people in marker. A few words can be a nice touch on a guitar, whatever message you want it to include.


Use permanent marker, and make sure it dries completely before you touch it. It's very easy to smudge and make the smudge what's permanent.

Use an appropriate guitar.,
Remove the tuning pegs and strings.,
Remove anything you don't want to paint.,
Remove the finish from the guitar.,
Apply primer and an even coat of base paint.,
Apply additional decoration on top, if desired.,
Finish with topcoat.",How to Decorate a Guitar2," Only use cheap guitars for stripping and painting. If you've got an old beater that you want to punk-up a bit, that's totally cool. But it's probably not a great idea for the '66 Les Paul Standard your grandfather left you in his will. If you want to change the color of an expensive guitar, buy it in that color, or have it customized at a guitar shop.


It's important to understand that painting a guitar can seriously alter the tone woods and affect the sound that you get from the instrument. You've been warned.

, Before you do any stripping or painting, it's important to get the guitar ready for alteration mode, and get it out of playing mode. Strings can be removed by slackening them completely and then unwrapping them from the tuning pegs. Most tuning pegs can be unscrewed from the headstock using a small Phillips-head screwdriver, and then pulled from the slot.

, Remove the pick-guard and the pickups, if necessary, as well as any toggle switch caps or volume control knobs that you don't want to be colored whatever color you plan on painting the guitar. You can usually just pop these off and snap them back on.


If you break a control knob cap during the process, they're available for cheap from any guitar shop or online guitar retailer, if your guitar is a standard model.

, Depending on the finish on your guitar, you'll need to use a variety of different techniques to get it off.


Most acoustic guitars are stained and finished and will need to be sanded down before you attempt to repaint the guitar. In general, this is the worst idea and the most damaging for instruments. If you have a decent quality guitar, use more minor decorations, or just paint on top of the finish.
Electric guitars need to be heat-blasted with a heating gun to remove the poly finish.If your guitar looks like it has a hard plastic outer shell, that's a poly finish, and you'll need to use a heat gun on low setting to soften it before scraping it off with a putty knife.
Alternatively, of course, you can go the DIY punk route and just paint your skulls and panthers, or your metal band's logo directly on top of the guitar's current finish in acrylic paint or Sharpie marker. Might not look as professional, but that's probably what you're going for anyway.

, Guitars should be painted like other wooden objects, first sanded gently to create a smooth surface from which to work, then primed with wood primer, then covered with at least two even coats of latex or oil-based paint appropriate for use on wood.


Generally, you want to use a high-sheen variety of paint, which is more common for guitars. This also helps to hide the imperfections in the surface.
Allow each coat to dry completely before moving on to the next.
In general, you don't want to use rattle-cans of spray paint, unless you want a super-junky look, which can be cool too.

, After the base coat color is dry, you can use small paint brushes and acrylic paints to add additional details and designs as you want. Keep the additional details as basic as possible. Consider using any of the following designs for a little detail:


Thorn branches
Flowers
Paisley designs
Skulls
Roses
Stars
Your band's logo

, All guitars will get beaten up over time, from use, so it's important to apply a poly topcoat to keep the guitar as safe as possible. This is what gives it that hard, plastic-like finish.


Find a topcoat variety that works well with the type of paint you've used. Some won't work well with latex, for example.

Next, scoot your left foot forward and return the right foot to it's original position. do this as many (at least 5) times as you like across the stage, and have fun. BUT...don't fall or stop moving, you WILL look like an idiot. Be careful though; this is a good 30 years out of style, so you still might look like an idiot.;
, Step forward with one foot, then slide it back to its original position. Then do this with the opposite foot. Repeat however many times needed. If you are successful, it should look something like the running man!

, This is a very primitive move, but one of the most used and most entertaining. Simply jump in the air and tuck your knees in, then land. An alternate way is to jump in the air and separate your legs so it looks like you did a kick. Make sure your guitar is out of the way when you do this, or you'll bang your knees up and it will hurt.

, This is where you throw your guitar (make sure you have a strap lock!) over your fretting hand shoulder and then it will swing around your back and come back to you underneath your armpit. For more information, see the link below.

, Make your picking very dramatic. Strum really hard and look angry at the guitar. Bend your elbow and sort of ""throw"" your picking hand at the strings. Kurt Cobain held his picking hand in place and then moved the guitar neck up and down to strum. Try making up your own ""signature"" picking styles. A great way for a beginner to show their style.

, Look at the floor, and then rotate your head in a circular motion. Works great if you have long hair. This can hurt your neck if you do it too long, though. Also try bobbing your head up and down. Or side to side like you're saying no. This might affect your playing for the first time and you will find it difficult to do multiple tasks at once.

, Your playing stance is very important. Most of the time you want your legs to be spread out. A good punk rock stance is to spread out your legs, slightly bend your knees, rest your guitar on your thigh, lean back, and then attack your strings with your pick!

, Also called 'the crazy idiot'. Lay on the ground on your side (with your guitar, duh!) and use your legs to go in circles. Make sure there is enough room and people aren't around you. A wireless guitar is recommended for this.

, This one is extremely dangerous, it is just on here for looks. Take off your guitar, and throw it in the air so it does a flip or two, and then catch it. Put it back on and then start playing again.

, Turn your guitar so the headstock is pointing towards the ceiling, and then play.

, Made famous by The Who, just swing your arm in a circle and strum the guitar at every revolution (warning: watch the whammy bar).

, This needs no explanation.

, Made famous by The Who, done more recently by Tenacious D. Get a running start, and then fall onto your knees. If done correctly, you'll slide about 4 feet (1.2 m) across the floor.

,, The grip tighter to stop and put your strap back on.

, This may take some practice but its great, you can toss your pick to the audience or even a second player.

,, This is when you crouch down like a crab and head bang at the same time. Lots of metal bands do this at the breakdown part of their song in their music videos.

First think-what kind of music do you want to play?,
If you like jazz/blues, you may want to get a hollow-body guitar.,
If you like Folk/acoustic rock, Martin and Taylor are the way to go- if you're willing to shell out more.,
If you like heavy metal or Post-Hardcore, Schecter, ESP/LTD, Ibanez, and Jackson are a few major brands of guitar that have a great bang for buck effect.

,
For modern or classic rock, Fender and Gibson are great brands.,
Do some more research.,
Don't be afraid to go used.,
Build your own stuff.,
Use guitar forums like http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/forum/ to get great advice from seriously experienced guys.",How to Get a Great Guitar Sound for a Low Price," This is what makes all the difference in deciding what gear to buy.;
, These are beautiful guitars that sound great with low distortion and bassy tone. Ask about Epiphone, Washburn and Ibanez hollow bodies. Danelectro's are super cheap, but some people don't like the tone from them.

, For a low price, the best acoustic would probably be an Epiphone, or an Alvarez.

,, (Or Epiphone. They have the same guitars with slightly lower quality, but Epiphone is three times cheaper.)

, Go to a music store and ask one of the clerks about the guitars you are interested in. Avoid big chain music stores with ""monster deals"" for research unless you are testing for yourself. Most of the time the staff there is not going to be as knowledgeable or experienced as a smaller shop with dedicated, long-term employees, and the small stores will tend to be more truthful about products because they want your return business.

, Buying from places like eBay could save you a lot of money and get a lot of tone for the cash. As with buying anything, make sure it works and is not a fake.
, It takes a lot more skill than buying but building could save some serious cash. Granted building something like a guitar is hard and is best left to professionals. However, building effects pedal (such as a tube screamer type pedal) is commonplace and gives great bang for your buck. If you're even more handy with your soldering iron, make your own amp. Parts are readily available from the internet (as with effects pedal parts) and could be your ticket to cheap tonal nirvana.

, What's more, it's absolutely free.

Paint your guitar.,
Add stickers or decals.,
Draw or write with pens.,
Add colorful binding or purfling.",How to Customize Your Guitar1," Disassemble your guitar carefully to paint the body of it with spray paint or another paint that is safe for guitars. Add designs or repaint the whole surface, then top with a guitar lacquer for a shiny, professional finish.


It’s important to sand down the surface of the body before you paint, using sandpaper and a sanding block to smooth the surface and help the paint adhere to it.It’s a good idea to coat the body with a primer before adding paint. Add several layers of each to get an even color in your desired shade.Note that painting, especially if you’re doing the entirety of the guitar body, is best done on a solid-body electric guitar. Hollow-body guitars like acoustic guitars are more sensitive to changes to the wood and susceptible to getting the paint into the interior of the instrument.;
, Add any stickers or decals you want to the body of an electric or acoustic guitar for some extra character, color, or to make a statement.


Note that most typical stickers will leave a sticky residue behind or even pull up the lacquer or paint on your guitar. Make sure you are happy with the stickers being there permanently before you apply them.
You can buy decals that look a little bit like giving your guitar a tattoo. It’s best to spray a coat of lacquer over a decal for a shine consistent with the rest of your guitar., Sketch out your own freeform design or use a stencil to create patterns, pictures, or words on the body of your guitar with markers, pens, or paint pens.


Remember that most markers and pens are permanent. Sketch out a design lightly with a pencil before you add color from a marker. You may be able to remove some color with a little rubbing alcohol.Try adding your own signature to your guitar for an extra personal touch.
You can also add some sparkle to your designs by applying small gems or rhinestones using wood glue.

, Choose a colored or patterned decal to easily change up the existing binding and purfling on the edges of your guitar, which are the thin plastic or wood pieces between any two edges of the instrument body.The binding piece on your guitar is usually white or neutral wood, but the purfling can come in a herringbone pattern or other colors and patterns.

Try different shapes, designs, or even custom words for each fret.Carefully remove the strings on your guitar, clean and dry the surface of the fretboard, and center the stickers evenly on the frets to apply them.
You can also buy stickers meant for the headstock of your guitar, which you can even personalize with your name like a famous musician!

, Add a pickguard to your guitar in a fun color, shape, or pattern. The pickguard is used to protect the surface of your guitar face from scratching of the pick, but it can also be a highly decorative, customizable piece.


Applying a new pickguard is easiest to do on a guitar that doesn’t already have a one, but it may be possible to replace an existing one by carefully removing it with a bridge removal knife and a little heat from a lamp., Replace your current strings and tuning knobs with colorful varieties or different finishes.


Make sure you don’t sacrifice quality when replacing guitar strings. Use the same gauge and steel or nylon material of your current guitar (or upgrade to better quality!), or you will end up with a completely different sound and feeling while playing.Electric guitars have even more options for knob customization, as you can replace knobs on the face of the guitar as well with special shapes and materials. Just make sure you check whether your guitar has solid shaft or split shaft pots before you buy new knobs., Replace the pins that hold your guitar strings on the bridge of your guitar. Customize with unique pins that contain shell, bone, brass, or other materials that give them color and shine.


Bridge pins made from bone and wood can also change and improve the quality of sound from your guitar strings., If you have an electric guitar with pickup covers that can be replaced, try a new color or finish for them.


All you should need is a screwdriver to replace removable pickup covers. They come in all different colors and finishes to complement your guitar any way you want."

You can also make your own hard case if you have good woodworking skills and access to the materials necessary to cut a custom shape for your guitar.
Make sure that if you make your own case, there is no extra room inside for your guitar to rattle around and get damaged, but also doesn’t get squeezed too tightly.

, Try spicing up an old case with new, unique details to display your personality and style.


On a soft case, you can sew or iron on patches, embroider patterns, or attach buttons or piping.
On a hard case, you can add stickers, paint or pen designs, or replace the clasps and other hardware with new fixtures in a different metal or color.
On any case, you can also try customizing the lining by hand-sewing or using fabric glue to attach your own fabric in a fun color or pattern to the inside of the case. Just make sure your guitar still fits well in the case with your added lining., Get yourself a new guitar strap to easily add a touch of color or pattern to the overall look of your instrument. Choose a wide, well-made strap for comfort and durability.


You can also make your own guitar strap with any piece of heavy fabric and the right fittings to attach it to your guitar. Or, simply spruce up your existing strap by wrapping new fabric around it., Get new picks that express your style or complement the look of your guitar. Find guitar or music stores that can create custom picks for you, or that make unique or unusual picks.


You can even make your own picks using a pick puncher, which cuts out the right shape from any hard plastic or other suitable material."

Ask around.,
Make your choice.,
Communicate!,
Attend a no obligation trial lesson!",How to Find a Guitar Teacher," You might know somebody who plays the guitar or who knows somebody who could put you in the direction of a good guitar teacher. This method of searching is very useful as you will be able to ask questions to a student about the lessons they receive. If you really don't know anybody who can help then contact local music shops who will give you a list of tutors in the area .;
, Once you have a list of guitar teachers you need to decide on a few things. How much can you afford to spend per month? (Guitar lessons are usually hourly or half hourly a week and most tutors keep a regular time slot that you will be expected to regularly attend for at least a month). What style of music do you want to play? (Most guitar tutors can teach a variety of styles but some teachers specialize in only one style eg. classical or rock. If you want to learn to play blistering Van Halen solos then a strictly classical teacher will not be as qualified as a teacher who plays rock guitar). do you require one to one lessons or do you want to join a small group or class? If you can already play the guitar but have a specific technique or style you wish to learn then consider this too.

, Call a few teachers on your list to find out if they are within your budget, that they are able to teach the styles that you want to learn, if you are looking for a tutor for your child then make sure that they are CRB checked and have a safe learning space and that you are able to sit in on the lessons. You also need to speak to any potential tutors to make sure that you get along from the start! What experience or qualifications does the teacher have? (many guitar teachers are not academically qualified but this doesn't mean that they are bad teacher!)

, Some tutors offer the chance to attend a lesson (not free though) to see how you get on. If you attend a trial lesson you can treat it as an interview to decide if you will employ the teachers services. If there is a good learning atmosphere, you are made to feel relaxed and comfortable and you feel that you are LEARNING then you should book some more lessons.

Know that it is essential that you keep your bow straight, about halfway between the bridge and the end of the fingerboard.,
Bowing should be done with the elbow and the wrist; the shoulder should not move much at all.,
Mind the pressure you place on your violin strings.,
Now, articulations.",How to Use Exquisite Bowing Techniques on a Violin," Also, make sure your bow isn't leaning in either direction, but is perpendicular to the strings.;
, Your elbow should be approximately the same height as your shoulder when the bow is placed on the A or D string(this may differ on how you hold your violin and what style of teaching you use, most students that use the Suzuki method of teaching are sometimes told to put a book under their shoulder to use more wrist and less arm, however this can result in not using a full bow on louder notes resulting in poor projection which can make one press too hard on the bow causing it to give a scratchy sound.) Sometimes it is helpful to lean your shoulder against a doorpost so that it cannot move.

,


PP =Pianissimo. Put on enough pressure to not make a wispy sound but light enough so that the audience (or you) can hear it clearly, and softly.
P = Piano. Use a bit more pressure but not so much that it sounds like F. It should show contrast from PP so that they don't sound exactly the same, but not too loud. It should be a little bit less pressure than MF.
MP = Mezzopiano. Medium soft, a mix between P&MF. Many violinists make the mistake of thinking that MP is quieter than P, but it is actually louder. The Mezzos (MP&MF) are difficult to analyze, because they are the most unique dynamic and are used to show small contrast.
MF = Mezzoforte. Medium loud, give it a light, airy sound that does not hold too long, and then crescendos or diminuendos(decrescendos) in a piano sound.
F = Forte. Loud, try to use your full bow if the passage you are playing allows you to. It will give it a full sound. The sound of Forte.
FF =Fortissimo Very loud; don't hesitate to play the loudest sound your instrument can produce! And yes, there are FFF(fortonoando)& FFFF(sometimes referred to blastissimo), but you do not see them often. FF is extremely loud. Considered the opposite of PP, use a lot of pressure for this loud dynamic. Also, increase speed of your bow.

,


Trills- Make sure to have plenty of bow to give it a full sound, and make sure it resonates. Try to trill fairly fast also.
Slurs- A slur is more than one note played in the same bow stroke. String crossings are sometimes difficult when you slur, so it's recommended that you let you bow flow to the the next string. Do not jerk your hand/arm; it will hit the other string too early, or you won't leave the other string in time.
Staccato - Very quick, short notes. Jerk your hand, not your arm. Think of it as a ""bouncing a ball"" motion.
Spiccato - Spiccato is done near the frog of the bow (on the balancing point), never near the tip as this is very difficult. Allow your bow to leave your string. Spiccato is like many fast lifts, so remember, move your arm a concave curve. You have to use your fingers to propel the bow to move. Always bounce the bow near the string, lest you get a short, scratchy sound. Try to make the sound lush and longer. Spiccato requires lots of practice and listen to how your teacher describes doing it.
Play a full bow, but there are times when one may have to play at the frog for a strong sound, or play at the tip for a soft sound.
Be very particular with the section of the bow and the speed at which you are playing.

Understand why violinists use rosin.,
Choose a rosin.,
Make sure that you are using violin rosin.",How to Use New Rosin on a New Violin Bow1," Rosin is a mild adhesive that's used in string instrument playing to increase the friction between the hair of the bow and the string. The rosin temporarily ""sticks"" to the string until its limit of adhesion is reached, and then releases. When a bow is new, or has been rehaired, the initial layer of base rosin may take some time to get in place, depending on the ""roughness"" of the hair-string (stallion vs. mare, cold vs. warm climate, what the horses ate, etc.) it may take very little time, or quite a bit more time.


Rosin is basically the same substance that you see pitchers use on the pitching mound in a baseball game to increase their grip on the ball. It is generally produced as a refining by-product while distilling turpentine from tree saps (mostly various species of pine) - it's the goo that's left after the spirits have been evaporated off.
Contrary to many old beliefs, the hair does not have microscopic hooks that are raised up by rosin. Under a microscope, the hair looks like a swamp reed, with slightly ragged growth rings that themselves don't have enough friction to do any more that just tickle a whisper from a string. However, they do have enough friction to provide a way for the rosin to transfer and hold to the hair. Once there, the rosined hair will begin a succession of ""grab and release"" catches of the string to cause a somewhat sustained vibration of the string.;
, There are also various types of rosins, most notably by color: some are lighter, and some darker. The best rosin is the one that works best under the playing conditions you are presently experiencing, which is why many advanced players carry a variety of rosins with them to meet the needs of varying playing conditions.


As a somewhat general rule, darker rosins tend to be softer, melt at a lower temperature (like in the summer sun), and grip better in colder weather.
Very light rosins tend to be just the opposite: harder, work better in warmer weather where a darker rosin might tend to soften and became gooey while playing.

, Using new rosin on a bow depends on what instrument you have. You cannot use the same rosin from a cello or a bass on a violin's bow. The result would be a change in tone in your violin playing. If continued, this will render the violin's bow useless. However, it's okay to use a viola's rosin for a violin – or vice versa.

"

Prepare the bow.,
Prepare the rosin.,
Lift the bow onto the other rosin.,
Rub the rosin onto your bow.,
Apply the rosin to the entire bow.",How to Use New Rosin on a New Violin Bow2," Then, gently take the bow out of its container and tighten the horse hairs (which are white) until they are taut. Look at the wood of the bow: it should not be bent downward or upward.


If too tight, move the peg of the bow left until the wood is straight. If too loose, move the peg right so that the wood does not sag.

, Once you have the correct rosin, uncap or slide it out of its container. Use a closed pen to scratch your rosin until it is rough and gritty. Try to rub gently so you don't damage your rosin. Once the resin is exposed, you're ready to apply the rosin to your bow.


Wash your hands before so you don't get your rosin dirty. Be sure you also wash your hands after because your hands will be sticky and messy with rosin dust.

, The frog, which is the dark part of the bow near the peg, should be next to the rosin. The horse hair should be on top of the rosin.

, The application is simple: from frog to tip and back, ""play"" the rosin back and forth until you feel the bow gripping and no longer slipping. The heat created by the friction of the back and forth motion will cause the surface of the rosin to soften enough to allow the transfer of rosin to hair to take place.


Gently, and with little pressure, brush the hair of the bow against the rosin. One stroke down should end with the tip of the bow (the other end) next to the rosin. Then, go backwards so that the frog is next to the rosin again. Repeat up and down strokes five times.
Be careful. Don't ""play"" the rosin very quickly, or you'll risk breaking the bow. The new bow is not yet used to the high tension

, Keep ""playing"" the rosin until the entire bow is coated in rosin. Rub the rosin back and forth over a 2 inch (5.1 cm) area, several times quickly. When you've thoroughly coated this part of the bow, move to the next 2 inch (5.1 cm) section.

"
"
Test the bow.,
Be patient.,
Clean off the rosin dust as soon as possible.",How to Use New Rosin on a New Violin Bow3," Lift your violin onto the curvature of your shoulder. Then, lift the bow and place the frog on one string of the violin. Make sure the bow is not dragging on any other string or the wood of the violin. Stroke back and forth with gentle pressure while listening for a note.


Remember to maintain the same amount of pressure through out the strokes. Change in pressure will cause some parts of the bow to play notes clearly and others not as clear.

, Once a base layer of rosin is on the hair, achieving maximum playability is somewhat accomplished by feel. If you aren't getting the response you need, apply a few quick strokes of rosin to reestablish the friction level needed. Rosin will flake off the surface of the hair while playing, so it's common to re-apply.


If the violin still does not make noise again after rosin is put on, put more rosin on until notes are heard clearly.

, Because of its origins, rosin dust should be wiped off the surface of the instrument as soon as practical. Remember that it came from a refining process to get turpentine, and that there will always remain a small residual fraction of that turpentine in the rosin. Turpentine is a very effective solvent for removing paints and varnishes, including the varnish on the top of your instrument.

First, you need a guitar and an amplifier.,
You'll probably want some effects.,
Make some time; a couple hours should be enough.

,
The basic theory behind this whole process is to figure out how to make a sound, and then figure out how to manipulate it.,
Once you have your noise, figure out how to manipulate it.,
Now you have your sound.,
In order to keep your audience's attention, you're probably going to need to do some pitch manipulation.,
Now you've got a signature sound!,
Go wild with it!

",How to Create a Unique Guitar Technique," Really any one will do, but you will want one that is noisy. The perfect setup for a guitar is one with single-coil pickups, two volume knobs and a pickup selector, and preferably a tremolo bar. The amp isn't really important, but before you leave the store make sure it sounds good and can get some good feedback (reasonably good; really loud if you're right next to the amp, nonexistent if you back away).;
, They're not necessary, but you'll find you have a lot more options if you make a solid $500 investment. Pay special attention to the effects that you can control; an effect is an effect, but having control over the effect is what allows you to create rather than replicate. Some good examples are a wah-wah pedal, a whammy pedal (or other pitch alteration device, especially if it has a harmony setting), and a talk box.

,, So, do everything and anything you can think of to make your guitar make an odd noise. Don't be afraid of abusing is (see Warnings). A good example is feedback; step up close to your amp and wait until you hear the high-pitched, whiney noise.

, This is where your effects come in. Try out your wah or talk box. These are the basis of the originality of your sound, so be creative. Sometimes, just having them on completely changes the sound. Play around.

, The next step is putting it into a song.

, This is easily accomplished by toying around with a whammy pedal. For a more natural sound, you can also use a tremolo bar (if, of course, your sound does not require the use of both hands). Use this to make a sort of melody or solo, or whatever. It's your sound, do what you want with it.

, Keep in mind that the feedback example is just that: an example. The possibilities are limitless. Try hitting your guitar with something, unplugging and messing around with the cable, whatever. As long as it makes a sound, you can use it. Some other techniques are listed below.

There are two ways to determine if your violin is out of tune.,
Whichever method you choose to use, what you need to figure out is how far the string’s pitch is from the pitch that is desired.",How to Tune a Violin1," For more advanced violinists, try playing ""A"" on a piano or keyboard, and compare it to the pitch of the plucked string. Most beginning violinists fare better with a tuner, which is a device that determines the frequency of any open string--or, actually, any note--a musician plays. Tuners are extremely helpful and precise, and you can buy them for a reasonable price at most music stores. If you choose to use a tuner, the tuner will indicate exactly how sharp or flat a string is by picking up the sound as you play that string.






;
, If the note you are plucking on your violin is a just a little higher than the note on your tuner or piano, then you should use the fine tuner method to tune the violin. However, if the string is way out of tune, you should use the peg method to get the string closer to the desired pitch, and then use the fine tuner method to perfect the tuning.








"
"
While using the fine tuners to tune your violin, you may simply lay the instrument across your lap as long as you are very careful to keep it from falling to the ground.








,
Fine tuners are small, circular, screw-like devices found at the top of the tailpiece, which is located in the lower part of the instrument and shaped a bit like a triangle.,
Follow these steps on all four strings.",How to Tune a Violin2,",









Each string can be gradually tightened or loosened by the fine tuner positioned directly below it on the instrument. Not all violins have four fine tuners, and some have none at all.
If your instrument does not have fine tuners, then you will have to tune with your pegs. Fine tuners are meant to be turned either clockwise or counterclockwise to affect the pitch of the string, and they are helpful only when a slight change in pitch is needed.
If the string you wish to tune is too low-pitched, then you should turn the fine tuner clockwise, or the way that a clock‘s hands turn. This will tighten the string, and therefore raise the pitch. But if the peg is tight and doesn't turn easily, it should be turned so the string is loosened and then tightened the string again. This will avoid breaking the string by placing to much force on the peg. Pluck the string again, and observe if it is closer to the desired pitch then before. Turn and pluck as many times as necessary. If it eventually becomes too high-pitched when you pluck, follow the instructions in the next step.
If the string is too high-pitched, turn the fine tuner counter-clockwise, or the opposite of the way that a clock‘s hands turn. This will loosen the string and therefore lower the pitch. Pluck the string again, and observe if the sound is closer to the desired pitch then before. Turn as many times as necessary. If it is now too low-pitched when you pluck, follow the directions in previous step.

, The next string you should tune after ""A"" is ""D"", which is to the left of ""A."" Then, after you tune ""D,"" you should try tuning ""G."" ""G"" is to the left of ""D."" Lastly, once all of the other strings are tuned, you can tune ""E.""








"
"
While tuning with the pegs, hold the violin in front of you so that you can see the strings and so that the bottom part of the instrument rests on your legs.,
Locate the correct peg that you will be using to tune.,
Once you have located the peg that you will be turning, you are ready to tune!,
With one hand, grip the desired peg.,
As you turn the peg, pluck the string you are tuning but still keep a firm hold on your violin.,
When you would like to stop turning the peg, you should gently push the peg into the instrument to reinforce its position.,
When the peg finally sticks in place, pluck the string again and listen carefully.,
When you pluck the string and the pitch is just a little out of tune, then you may use a fine tuner to perfect the pitch.",How to Tune a Violin3," One hand should always be firmly holding the violin and the other hand should be tuning. This position will help you to create the force needed to turn the pegs correctly and it will keep your instrument safe.








, Pegs, which are often made of ebony, are knobs located on the neck of your violin near the top. Observe that each of your violin's four strings is attached to one of the four pegs. Turning one of these pegs tightens or loosens one of the strings, therefore changing its pitch. If you are tuning ""E,"" for example, then you will be turning the bottom right peg. If you are tuning ""A,"" you will be turning the top right peg. If you are tuning ""D,"" you will be turning the top left peg. And, finally, if you are tuning ""G,"" you will be turning the bottom left peg.








, Keep in mind the proper tuning position.








, You will be turning the peg “towards” you or “away” from you based on how you would like to change the current pitch of the string.









For strings that are very “sharp”, or high-pitched, you will need to turn the peg “towards” yourself.
For strings that are very “flat” or low-pitched, you will need to turn the peg “away“ from yourself.

, It is important to pluck the string so that you can hear how the pitch is changing.








, This will help keep the peg in place so that the tension won’t move it and make the string slip further out of tune. This can be difficult, so have patience! You can also gently push the pegs in as you're tuning.








, Is the string too high? Too low? Can it be tuned with a fine tuner, or is it so out of tune that you need to turn the peg some more?








, When it sounds just right, then you are finished. Congratulations! Time to move on to the other strings. Just as in the fine tuner method, the next string you should tune after ""A"" is ""D"", which is to the left of ""A."" Then, after you tune ""D,"" you should try tuning ""G."" ""G"" is to the left of ""D."" Lastly, once all of the other strings are tuned, you can tune ""E.""

Start by taking off the strings.,
Gather your tools.,
Start with the neck or body.,
Make sure all tuning pegs are snug but not tight.,
Dip a small portion of the towel into the water.,
Wipe down the body, limiting the water used.,
Spray contact cleaner in your switches and pots.,
Clean the frets, if you want.,
Once your guitar is clean, restring it and play.

",How to Clean an Electric Guitar," You need to remove all of them, no matter what is said about string tension. Do it by any means but don't destroy your guitar.;
, Once all the strings are off, get a microfiber towel (preferably) or a non-lint rag, regular, plain ol' tap water, fine steel wool, sandpaper, a set of screwdrivers, pliers, and tape (only use painter's tape or automotive tape).

, It doesn't matter, but in this tutorial we will start with the neck.

, Use the screwdrivers and the pliers to snug up all screws and the nut and washers on the peg.

, Wipe the neck down, scrubbing inside the frets. You don't need to water a dead tree, get off all excess water, and do not ever use oils or other guitar ""care"" products.

, Tighten all screws and watch you don't mess with your set up. Do not use any guitar ""care"" products.

, They will become dirty and have a terrible sound to them.

, This part is time consuming, so you may skip it if you like. Tape off the frets, and use the steel wool to clean each and every fret. Remember that the steel wool will scratch your fretboard, so tape off right at the fret.

Lay the bridge flat on the violin (under the strings).,

Carefully, lift up the bridge so that it eventually falls off in place.,

, You may want to loosen your strings before. You want to lift it in rotation-like motion. Do it slowly to avoid damaging the violin., If you loosened your strings, you'll need to retune them."
"
Make sure the tuning is the problem.,Sit down comfortably on a sturdy chair where you have plenty of light.,





Locate the keys on the top of your violin.,

Slowly and very carefully turn the keys and bring your violin the closest to the appropriate tuning as you can before moving to the next step.,

Tune your violin normally with the small pins near the bridge if you have them.
",How to Repair a Violin2," You know it's out of tune when your tuner reads the note as a completely different note (eg. when tuning on the G-string, the tuner reads it as an F#).,, They are usually black and difficult to move.,

If your key breaks, don't panic! Your violin is probably cheap or is very dry and fragile. You'll need to go to the luthier.

"

Buy another string.,

Loosen the little tuning pins near the bridge if you have them.
,

Insert the end with of the string with a bead on in the little hole beneath the tuning pins mentioned in the previous step.,

Take the other end of the string and insert it in the big tuning keys at the other end of the violin.",How to Repair a Violin3," Be sure to buy the right string, as they don't all have the same properties (eg. the E-string is thinner than the G-string).,, This hole is always there even if you don't have these tuning pins. Just look where the other strings are attached and you'll find it., Turn it a couple of times before tuning it. Make sure it doesn't slide."
"
Make sure stuck keys are the problem.,

Apply some graphite powder near the junction between the key and the violin.",How to Repair a Violin4," If your tuning keys are stuck, you'll notice while tuning that they refuse to move and seem glued to the wood., After a few twists, it should be as good as new.

If you don't have graphite powder, you can take a regular HB pencil and draw at the junction between the key and the violin.

Check over the violin and bow visually.,
Look inside the f-holes.,
Obtain any parts or accessories you may need.,
If needed, put the chin rest on the instrument using the chin rest tool.,
Clean and re-string your violin, or take it to someone who knows how to put violin strings on.,
Check over the bow visually.,
Add rosin to the bow.,
Play away.",How to Set Up a Violin," Make sure there are no missing parts or visible structural damage like cracks or open seams. From top to bottom, the violin should have a scroll, 4 pegs, a black fingerboard that is firmly attached to the neck of the instrument, a bridge, a tailpiece, and a chin rest.


Some parts are easily replaceable, like the bridge or chin rest, while some more serious repairs will require a specialist. If in doubt, ask a violin teacher whether your instrument needs anything special; they will usually help with setup and will let you know if it needs any additional work done.;
, You should find the manufacturer's tag, which will give you more information about where and when the instrument was made, and by whom. You should also see a small wooden dowel inside called a sound post. It should be sticking straight up. If it is crooked, bent, warped, fallen, missing, or is causing obvious strain to the belly of the instrument, then you will need to have it looked at. It looks tiny, but it's actually extremely important in terms of both structure and sound.


A sound post tool is used to remove and replace sound posts, and it's usually professionals who handle this.

, Make sure you get everything in the right size for your violin (e.g., 3/4, 4/4).


Chin rests, shoulder rests (or a soft sponge with a rubber band keeping it in place will do if not immediate access to a shoulder rest), bridges and strings are typically sold at music shops, or you can buy them online.
You should also buy a new set of strings, even if your violin came with all 4 strings, because those might be old and are more likely to unravel or break. Strings should be replaced at least once a year anyway.
You will also need rosin, instrument cleaning cloth, polish, a tuner/metronome, and maybe some peg drops in case you have trouble with your pegs slipping out of place.

, Most violins are sold with chin rests already on them, but they are removable. There are a variety of chin rests on the market, so if you're on a 4/4 violin and you're looking for something a little different, try asking a teacher which chin rest they recommend.

, It's not terribly complicated if you want to try your hand at it, but just make sure you look at which peg goes with which string before you take the old strings off.


It is necessary to put the two middle strings on first (A and D) in order to hold the bridge on, and it is also advisable to re-string one string at a time so that the bridge never actually has to come off.
The bridge should go halfway between the f-holes, and you can use the little crosses in the fs to line it up. Make sure it lays flat and isn't noticeably warped or crooked. (The downward sloped side is the E side.) Once there is enough tension to hold the bridge on, take out your tuner and tune the strings starting with A.

, Be careful not to touch the horsehair. Horsehair is sensitive to the oils on your hands and it will ruin it very quickly, making it dirty and slick. Make sure there is enough horsehair on the bow (about thumbnail-width) and it looks new or light in color.


Tighten the bow screw (about 10 turns, or until you feel the slightest resistance) and make sure the bow stick bends inward, not straight or outward. You can also check and make sure it has a grip, and you can just put a pencil grip on there if it's missing.
More expensive bows can be rehaired if necessary, but cheaper bows are usually just replaced if the hair becomes too sparse and oily. This is because cheaper bows are more difficult to take apart.

, If your bow is fresh-off-the-presses new, it does not make a sound yet when bowed across the strings. You need rosin, and lots of it! To start a new rosin block, take some car keys and scratch the smooth surface to release some rosin dust for the bow. Be careful not to break it. Then rub the rosin against the horsehair with slow, small motions from frog to tip, until the bow will make a sound against the strings. (If you see dust flying, you've done too much!)

, Your violin should be in playable condition now, so it's time to set up to play. Put the shoulder rest on the back of the violin (adjusting width if needed)—it should look like an arch, not a half pipe—and tighten/rosin the bow if you need to. (And to pack up, you'll loosen the bow and remove the shoulder rest.)

Practice a lot.",How to Produce a Bigger Violin Sound," If you have a violin teacher or friend who plays the violin, asking them may be useful as they will probably know who is the best dealer to go to.;
, A violin costing $1,000 will get you a decent violin, but cheaper violins can often be equally as good. Ask to try each violin in your budget range, and then get them to tell you about the instrument. If you are unsure what you are looking for then bring someone along who does if possible.


Remember that ultimately, it is your ability to play that matters; if you're a good player, you can make a tin violin sound amazing.

, The bow is equally as important in producing a sound as the violin itself. As a beginner violinist, you may not realize this, but it can be a reason behind not enjoying playing the violin, so it is a good investment to purchase a quality bow.


A mid-ranged bow is about $200-$500 dollars. Spending more than this may be a good idea if you are are planning to take your music learning further than a hobby.

, The strings too, have an impact on the sound quality the violin produces. The more popular brands of violin strings tend to produce a strong, pleasant sound, which is what renders them popular.However, it pays to experiment with strings from different brands as you become more confident playing, as eventually you'll find yourself preferring some strings over others, owing to both the sound produced and how they feel. This is not something an article can teach you; it's a feel-sense that you'll gain through playing and experimentation over time.

, These are: Speed, pressure and sounding point., Put more pressure on the bow as you play, to produce a fuller sound.

, Speed will create a louder sound. Do be aware that speed can also create a harsher sound, so it's important to refine your technique as well as playing faster.

, The flatter the bow is placed, the louder the sound that is produced. This occurs because more hairs from the bow are touching the strings on the violin.

, Playing at the heel of the bow produces a stronger sound compared to the tip.

, A good violinist does not apply the same sound level throughout a piece but varies the sound to reveal the mood and varying shades of the music. It is important to learn innately when to increase your violin's sound and when to keep it softer, varying it as you play the music., It's a cliché but the more you practice, the better you get. Moreover, the violin improves in tone too; research undertaken in the 1990s showed that the more a violin is played, the more the instrument's tone improves."

And last, the sides.







,, Put the chin rest under your jaw - it is called a chin rest, but you really place it under your jaw. The chin rest should be on the top of the instrument (use the diagram below to help you). Hold the instrument slightly slanted downwards, where you can balance a rubber bouncy ball (If you have one) on the C and G strings. Your wrist should be straight and not collapsed against the instrument. then turn the instrument is off to the side.

,
To play pizzicato, or pizz., you pluck the instrument's strings - put the thumb of the hand you are not holding the instrument with on the corner of the fingerboard, and pluck the string with your first finger. If you are playing guitar position (you are playing the instrument like a guitar - you can't play with the bow like this), you pluck the strings with your thumb only.






To play arco, play on the strings with your bow - hold the bow with your right hand, on the bottom with your thumb in the ferrule; your middle finger and ring finger over the grip and frog, slightly angled toward the screw; your first finger over the silver part above the grip or on the grip, bending over the bow gently; and your pinky finger on the bow on top of the screw. Then you put the bow hairs on the instrument's string, in the space where there is no fingerboard, while holding it up in up position; place it on the side of the bow hairs, with the bow angled towards the scroll a little bit. Pull the bow up and down as straight as possible to play the viola.







, The strings on the viola are, in order from left to right(thickest/lowest string to skinniest/highest string) are:


--------------------------------------- C String
--------------------------------------- G String
--------------------------------------- D String
--------------------------------------- A String

In other words, the thickest, lowest string on the left is the C String, the next string is the G String, the next String is the D String, and the last, skinniest, highest string is the A String - the D String is probably the most commonly used string.




, If you take classes, you may need to ask your teacher to help you label your finger positions with tape or stickers. If you don't take classes, then buy an electric tuner. Play with your bow (on the D String), your first finger, just a little bit away from the nut of the instrument, until the tuner says it sound like an E, then move on to an F♯ - put your second finger about an inch away from your in-tune first finger and play until the tuner says it sounds like an F♯. Then put your third finger down next to your in-tune second finger and play until the tuner says it sounds like a G. Put stickers in the three in-tune spots. The first, second, and third fingers are in the same positions as the D String fingers are, just on a different string.


These are the fingering positions for the viola: {anything in all caps is most commonly played by a beginner and the notes in parenthesis are another name for a note.)

remember there is no midway for 2 fingers on C, G, D, and A.
also remember that four fingers on the C string is a G and four fingers on the G string is a D. Four on D is A and four on A is an E.



, After reaching a certain level, you may want to learn it. It isn't, however, a good idea to learn vibrato if you haven't mastered the basic and intermediate levels of viola. It's a matter of personal preference, but most violists tend to do arm vibrato. Arm vibrato produces a slower, richer type of vibrato used in Largo-Andante tempos. This prevents you from looking like ""that maniac"" trying to frantically vibrate the string while playing at 50 beats a minute.

, Some people feel like they'll never be able to, but its an inevitability. At the very least you should recognize and A and be able to tune in 5ths. Be careful. Turning too tight due to a hard to turn peg can easily cause strings to snap and break. Using pencil lead to draw on the tuning pegs can help loosen them up. However get the lead only on the tuning peg(s) needing to be loosened.


If the tuning pegs are not staying in consider buying some peg compound to help it stick. A lubricant like WD40 can be used on the fine tuners, but do not get any water on the body of your viola.

Purchase the correct strings for your guitar.,
Lay the guitar on a flat, soft surface at a comfortable height.,
Turn the hole of the tuning post so that the hole faces you.,
Thread your first string through the bridge and into the tuning peg.,
Grab the string on both sides of the peg and crimp it in an ""s"" shape.,
Wrap the end of the string around the other half to lock the string in place.,
Lightly hold down the string as you slowly tighten it.,
Repeat the process on the rest of the strings.,
Cut the ends of the string off.,
Tune your guitar frequently once the new strings are on.",How to Change Strings on an Electric Guitar," If you're a serious guitar player you'll be changing your strings frequently, and some musicians change weekly. If your strings feel slow and sticky, or you have to re-tune frequently, you're due for new strings. If you haven't restrung in 3-4 months, get new strings.









If you're about to play a big gig, change the strings that morning to prevent unexpected breaking.;
, If you're new to tuning, you want to have a good sense of how the guitar should look. Take a picture of the strings, or simply look up a picture of your guitar online. While it isn't complicated, you want a good sense of how the guitar is strung before beginning.








Though it is rare, some guitars have special holes or winding patterns near the strings. Don't cut the strings off without take a quick look at everything.

, Turn the tuning machine or peg to loosen each string enough that you can unwind the string and pull it out but hand. You'll know you're loosening if, when plucked, the string sounds deeper. While you can also cut your strings off, this method eases tension gradually and, in the worst case scenario, you can reuse an old string if one breaks while restringing.









If you're a beginner, just loosen one string at a time. Then replace it and repeat with the next string.
Once loose, you can unwind the string off the tuning peg and free it from the neck of the guitar., On a regular bridge, like a Fender Strat or any other string-through guitar, just pull the strings out of the back of the guitar's body. To make it easier, carefully push the strings through, providing some slack and making them easier to grip. Grab the string by the small, donut-shaped metal end and slowly pull it through the guitar.









Most guitars are strung in a simple, straightforward manner, so just follow the string through the guitar to remove it.
Do not yank the strings out. Protect your guitar by taking your time.
If you have a wrap-around bridge, you will be able to pull them out of the underside of the bridge. Wrap-arounds started out as Toms when players like ZZ Top wrapped the strings around the tailpiece to give the string height a low profile without any buzz., Use this time to remove all of the dust, grime, and dirt from the neck of your guitar. This will make the guitar look good, protect the new strings, and actually make your guitar feel a little faster. For deeper cleaning, purchase a bottle of fret-cleaner from your local music shop.








, 95% of the time you should get the ""regular weight,"" or ""lite"" strings. While some guitarists use heavier gauges or odd string configurations, you can't simply grab a set of strings if your guitar is not made for it. Strings that are too heavy for your guitar can warp or bend the neck without the proper adjustments, so stick to regulars until you know more about your guitar.









In general, you want your high E to be a "".008-.0011"" thickness. This is for medium, lite, and extra lite strings.
If you use drop tunings, like a drop D, you might want heavier strings. Ask your music store staff for a specific recommendation., Give yourself plenty of room to work, laying the guitar down on a table so that you can adjust it comfortably. Make sure to place a towel or blanket underneath to prevent scuffing or scratching. Some people like resting the head off the edge to make tuning easier.








, This hole should point away from the string so that it is parallel to one of the frets. If you were holding the guitar and playing it, the hole would be pointing up.

, Thread it from the inside of the guitar out. In general, most guitarists will begin with their heaviest string, the top E. It will often me marked as ""6th string,"" or by the highest gauge number (usually around .050). Slide it in the opposite way you took the other strings out, then run it through the hole in the tuning peg, pulling the string away from the guitar. Make sure you leave 2-3 inches of slack, as well -- you don't want the string to be taut before you even start tightening.









The tuning pegs aren't marked, but you should just replace the strings in the same order you took them out. On most electric guitars, the first peg is for the top string, then each one further towards the tip of the head is for a string further down., Try not to overthink this. Simply grab both sides tightly, then turn your hands clockwise to crimp both sides of the string along the tuning post. If you pulled the string out, it would look like the ""S"" in the Van Halen logo.









Your right hand will be coming towards your body, away from the guitar.
Your left hand will be pushing up, in towards the other tuning pegs.

, Take the end of the string and pull it under the other side of the string (the side being fed into the tuning post). After you go underneath the string, bring the end back over the top and pull it taut, pulling towards the very tip of the guitar. You're basically creating a loop with the end of the string around the rest of the string.









You'll have a small coiled bit of string right where the string meets the tuning peg.

, Place your index finger on the string 1-2"" before it meets the tuning peg. You don't want to pin it, just hold it down. Then you can turn your tuner slowly counter-clockwise. Make sure that your string is winding around the peg in a uniform manner.









Use a tuner to slowly get yourself up to the proper tension. When in doubt, try not to over-tighten -- this causes strings to break.

, Once you've got the first one done, repeat the process on the rest of the strings, working through the packet. Remember to clean the fretboard after removing a string, to leave some slack in the string before tightening, and to crimp the string in place before starting to turn.









If your head has a 3x3 set-up, remember that the lower set of tuning pegs must be turned in reverse. Simply repeat the proceeding instructions, replacing left with right and up with down.

, Use wire cutters to remove the excess string at the end, though you may want to leave 1/2"" or so to allow deeper tunings, if you desire.








, As the strings get used to the tension, they slowly stretch. This only occurs for the first 1-2 days, and can be avoided by regular, constant tuning as you put the strings on.

The point of effects is to make your guitar or bass sound better in its musical context or to make it sound new and different or even just to have fun making strange noises.,
The most noticeable and commonly seen effects are those little 3"" or 4"" square boxes you often see on the floor in front of guitar or bass players.,
Larger floor units with big buttons for players to push with their feet and multiple types of effects are common as well.",How to Buy Guitar Effects1," (Many effects processors can give you hours of juvenile joy just messing around with them.);
, These are called stomp boxes due to a large steel button the player steps on to turn the effect on or off. There are also floor boxes which feature foot treadles for continuous control of one or more effects.

, All of these types of effects can be referred to as effects pedals. Rackmount effects are meant to be mounted by their front panels into a standard equipment rack. These often come with an associated foot controller. Finally, many modern amplifiers feature built-in effects with controls on the amp's primary control panel or optional floor controllers. There are plenty of other special types of effects that have been used over the years, but the vast majority are simply modifications of one of the categories below.

"
"
While learning to play one's instrument is, of course, far more important than modifying its sound, messing around with effects early on can be a fun way to engage with the instrument and start learning its tonal range without a lot of hard practice.,
Alternatively, there is a broadening selection of very low-priced multi-effects pedals that give you a lot more to mess around with and get your feet wet with a lot of different effects types.,
If you've already been playing for a while, look to artist interviews (such as those online here at Musician's Friend) to find out what your favorite artists use to produce their signature tones.,
Finally, and most importantly, check out the sound bytes we've posted for most of the effects on our website.",How to Buy Guitar Effects2," There's a huge variety of stomp boxes out there, many with very low price tags that make great gifts and can add a new dimension of fun for beginning players.

, A practice amp with built-in effects is also a great way to get started. Most modern multi-effects units and amps feature presets created by experienced engineers to sound good at the touch of a button. If you're a typical player, you'll adopt and abandon dozens of different effects boxes over your playing career.

, Also, if you hang around late at club shows or show up early, most players are willing to talk about their rigs.

, These will give you an idea of what each of these effects can do when used by a pro. Referring to our sound bytes while reading this guide will give you a more concrete sense of what various effects sound like.

"
"
By and large, delay effects split the signal into two identical signals and momentarily hold back one while allowing the other to play in real time.",How to Buy Guitar Effects3," The signals are mixed back into one at the output. Usually you can control the length of the delay and the amount of the signal that is affected versus the part that stays ""dry"" (unaffected). This latter control—found on most effects—is usually called the level control.

"
"
Reverb is the most natural of effects.,
Reverb thickens up your sound, softens the edges, and makes it sound like you're playing in a large hall (or a bathroom or stairway).,
Echo (also called long delay) is a natural effect as well, but it can only be encountered in large spaces such as canyons or maybe a large, empty stadium.",How to Buy Guitar Effects4," You can experience reverb by singing in the bathroom or a concrete stairway. This type of sound is easy to duplicate by putting transducers on either side of a spring and running a guitar or bass signal through it. Spring reverbs have been included on many guitar amps since the early 1960s.

, Though there is scarcely a record made that doesn't use any reverb, you should use it judiciously. Heavy reverb almost always sounds bad. If you buy a dedicated reverb unit, it will give you several varieties of reverbs to choose from.

, You emit a loud, sharp yelp and a second later you hear the yelp come bouncing faintly back to you from a far wall. This is a particularly fun effect to play around with by yourself. If you set the delay long enough, you can play against the notes you just played and harmonize with yourself while the rate sets up a kind of beat.

"
"
Echo controls usually let you determine the level, the period between playbacks, and the decay—the rate at which succeeding notes get quieter and quieter before they fade out altogether.",How to Buy Guitar Effects5," The period (or time) parameter is often controlled by a single button you push repeatedly in time with the music. This is called tap delay and keeps your echo effect from clashing with the music's time signature.

"
"
Chorus occurs when you duplicate the signal (some units create as many as 8 duplicates), keeping one in real-time and delaying the other only by a hair.",How to Buy Guitar Effects6," This creates a rich almost ""underwater"" sound. The more delay is added on the secondary signal the more vibrato and ""bubbly"" to sound will get. This is most common on acoustic guitar and saw it's golden days of usage in the 80's, not to say it's still not widely used today that is.

First if you don't already have one, get a guitar.,
Practice.,
Know music.,
If you don't know how to practice, get some good guitar books.,
Improve your finger strength and speed.,
Becoming a good guitarist takes years, you're not gonna wake up one day and be able to play an amazing riff.

,
When you're practicing, don't just play chords of songs you know.,
Try new things.,
You can also play guitar and sing at the same time,like Jimi Hendrix, Kurt Cobain, or James Hetfield, but most of the best guitarists these days don't really sing much.

,
If you feel that you are confident in your playing, play for family and friends.",How to Become Awesome at Guitar," Try to find one with a good sound. An equipped guitarist would have a supply of picks, an amp, cables, extra strings, and if you want to make cool sounds and effects, some effects pedals like Distortion or Wah. Or you can get a guitar pack that comes with all the essentials.;
, Practice. Practice. Do you think Jimi Hendrix woke up an amazing guitarist? NO! he practiced, and practiced, and practiced.HE probably practiced hours and hours every day. You practice at least half an hour a day and if you REALLY want to be really good, even more.

, Be able to read the staff, guitar tab, and chord markers well. Though, many great artists out there never did learn how to read music correctly...take Billie Joe from Green Day for an example.

, Look on the internet for some tips, if you don't already, Try to get an advanced guitar player teacher to help you with your playing and practice.

, By practicing a lot, your ability to move your fingers and hit the strings will increase. Your fingers will become stronger. You can also practice finger speed with guitar scales.

,, This could help with your chord knowledge (still do it) but you want to do some exercises. Try learning the different scales and just playing through them.

, Experiment with your Amp and your pedals. See what sounds you can make. Try to get a unique sound, ""your"" sound. Use your whammy bar(if you have one) and use different forms of strumming and playing the notes.

,, Do they think your good? Before you start looking for some sort of job as a guitarist, make sure you know and other people know that you can play REALLY well.

Make sure you understand what intonation is.,
Change the strings on your Strat, if necessary.,
Tune the lowest guitar string to an 'E.',
Sound the natural harmonic at the lowest string's 12th fret.,
Pluck the lowest string at the 12th fret.,
Adjust the bridge saddle for the lowest string.,
Repeat the process for the remaining strings.",How to Adjust Intonation on a Strat," On a fretted instrument like a guitar, intonation is the instrument's ability to produce fretted notes at the correct pitch all the way up the neck. Therefore, intonation hinges on the length of the string from saddle to nut. If the string is too long or short, the guitar will play farther and farther out of tune as you move up the neck.;
, Intonation should be checked every time you change a guitar's strings, so if your current strings are worn, consider changing them before adjusting the intonation. Each time you change strings, the tension in the strings may change or you may inadvertently move the bridge saddles, which will alter the intonation.

, With the guitar in playing position, tune the lowest string to an ""E."" Use a tuner for this, and take the time to get it right; precision counts when adjusting your Strat's intonation. If you regularly use a tuning other than standard E, you should tune the string to the note called for in your preferred tuning.

, To play this harmonic, lightly touch the string above the 12th fret and pluck it. The note sounded will be exactly one octave above the open string's pitch, because only half of the string is vibrating now.


Note that this harmonic can never be out of tune, because it resonates based on a fundamental principle. Half of the string's length will always sound at exactly one octave above the full string's pitch.

, After listening to the harmonic, fret the string at the 12th fret and play a note. The 2 notes should sound exactly the same. The goal is to adjust the string's length so that the 12th fret bifurcates it exactly in half. If the picked note is higher in pitch than the harmonic, you must lengthen the string. If the picked note is lower than the harmonic, you need to shorten the string.

, The saddle of the Strat's bridge is the rectangular metal piece on which the string rests at its highest point. To adjust it, simply use a Phillips screwdriver to tighten or loosen the screw at the back of the saddle. Tightening the screw will lengthen the string, while loosening it will shorten the string. Keep making minute adjustments until the 12th fret is exactly the same pitch as its natural harmonic.

, You may need to check each string's intonation a second time to make more minute adjustments, as adjusting the tension of each individual string will affect the others.

Get the right amp for the job.",How to Choose a Guitar Amplifier for Rock Music," Yes, it seems remarkably uncomplicated and highly un-technical, and there are really no acronyms to cover it. However, it's important to realize that from the outset, you have to like the sound the amp makes relative to the style of music you play.


A Marshall amp sounds absolutely amazing—if the style of music you're playing falls in to the Van Halen, Cream, or AC/DC camp.
A Fender amp also sounds amazing—if you're going for more of a Stevie Ray Vaughan, Jerry Garcia or Dick Dale sound.
The best way to determine what an amp sounds like is to play your guitar through it. If you are more of a beginner, not confident about your chops, but want an amp you can ""grow into,"" have somebody at the store play it for you. The critical issue here is how amp ""a"" sounds when compared to amp ""b,"" so do whatever it takes to get a good comparison.;
, Amps are rated by wattage rather than physical size (although high-wattage amps do tend to be physically larger).



Lower wattage tube amplifiers will tend to create harmonic distortion at lower volumes, which is preferable in practice, studio, and miked stage performance.

Higher wattage tube amplifiers will distort at higher volumes—which will require more creative mixing for live situations.
The wattage has an effect on both the actual and perceived sound volume. In general, it takes 10 times the wattage of an amp to double the perceived volume. For example a 10-watt amp will sound half as loud as a 100-watt amp
The wattage and cost of an amp are rarely related, as 10 watt amps can be two, three, or even ten times the cost of a 100 watt amp—depending on the quality of the components and the design. A knock-off 100-watt solid-state amp is inexpensive to produce compared to a boutique 5-watt tube amp.

, The sound quality experienced from an amplifier can be determined by many things, including (but not limited to):


the preamp tubes used
power amp tubes used
the wood material used for the speaker cabinet
the type of speaker cones
the resistance of the speakers
the guitar used
the cables used
the effects used
the pickups in the guitar
and even the fingers of the player.

, There are two main categories of guitar amplifiers configurations: combo and head/cabinet.


Combo (combination) amps combine the amplifier electronics with one or more speakers in a one-piece package. These are generally smaller, as combining a powerful head and a couple large speakers can quickly push an amp into the ""weightlifter"" category.






Head/cabinet arrangements solve the weight problem by separating the speaker cabinet (cabs) from the head—or amplifier—cabinet . Heads can be free-standing units that generally sit atop the cabs, or they can be rack-mounted units which are great for touring and more complex guitar signal chains.







, There are notable differences between the two styles of amplification. Tube amps use vacuum tubes in both the pre-amplification and power amplification stages, whereas solid-state amps use transistors for all stages. This can, and usually does result in markedly different tones.



Solid-state amps are known for delivering bright, clean, accurate sounds. They respond quickly to your playing, and are far more rugged than tube amps: think of the difference between a light bulb (tube) and an LED (solid state). Throw both of them on the floor, and you'll be scooping up one of them with a dustpan! Also, with advances in technology, many solid-state amps are loaded with a wide array of modeled amp sounds, giving you a lot of versatility.






Solid-state amps from a given manufacturer tend to sound the same, which can be a benefit when you need a reliable, repeatable tone. They are also notably lighter—both in weight, and on the pocketbook—than their tube brethren.
This versatility and ruggedness comes at the expense of warmth of tone. While this is an entirely subjective evaluation, there are some differences that account for this: when pushed into distortion, a solid-state amp's waveform shows a hard-clipped edge and harmonics that stay strong through the range of hearing. By comparison, a tube amp pushed to distortion has a soft clipping edge, and harmonics that fall off well within the limits of hearing, giving tube amps their famed warmth.

Tube (valve) amps have a certain unmeasurable ""something"" to them that makes them the most popular type of amp. The sound of a tube amp has been described as ""thick,"" ""creamy,"" ""fat,"" and ""rich""—adjectives that would pack on the pounds if amps were food!






Tube amps can vary slightly in tone from amp to amp, and certainly do from player to player. For some players, their amp is the one that, in conjunction with their guitar, defines their sound.
Tube distortion is softer, and to most, more pleasing to the ear, and when pushed hard, adds some compression to the dynamics that adds to sonic richness that only tubes can deliver.
Tube amps can be much more powerful than solid state amps. A 20-watt tube amp can easily sound as loud or louder than a 100-watt solid state amp.

, A tube amp—especially a large one—can be very heavy: a big negative if you regularly haul your gear up 3 flights of stairs!


Tube amps are also more expensive, both initially, and when it comes to maintenance. A solid state amp simply ""is."" Unless you have a massive power surge, your solid state amp will sound the same, year after year. However, vacuum tubes—like light bulbs—wear out over time and will need to be replaced. Tubes are not terribly expensive, but it will be an annual expense (depending on how much you use it).
Tube amps rarely have emulation-type effects. You'll need stomp boxes for those sorts of things. However, tremolo and spring reverb are often incorporated into amp designs.

, While it's good to know the pros and cons of both types of amps, it's not always the case that ""tube good, solid state bad."" Studies have shown that when played without distortion, tube amps and solid state amps are virtually indistinguishable., Here are some common configurations for combo amps:



Micro amps: 1 to 10 watts. These are tiny, ultra-portable amps which are useful for practice on the go (or when others are trying to sleep). They don't pack enough volume to be used in most ""jam"" situations (where you must be heard in the mix with other musicians). As a rule, their sound quality tends to be poor (when compared to larger amps) due to low output power and lower quality circuitry and are not adequate for professional performances. The Marshall MS-2 is an example of a super-portable (1 watt) micro amp which has received good reviews for a solid-state amp of this size.

Practice amps: 10 to 30 watts. Practice amps are also suited for the bedroom/living room environment, although the loudest of them may be used for small gigs (performances), especially if a microphone is used to send them through the venue's PA system. Popular practice tube amps that sound as good or better than many larger amps include, Fender Champ, Epiphone Valve Junior and the Fender Blues Jr. As a general rule, the best amps in this range feature 20 to 30 watts with at least a 10 inch (25.4 cm) speaker.

Full-size 1x12 combos: With 50 or more watts of power and at least one 12 inch (30.5 cm) speaker, the 1x12 amp offers the smallest package which is considered suitable for small gigs without using a microphone. For higher-end models, such as those produced by Mesa Engineering, the sound quality is of thoroughly professional calibre.

2x12 combos are similar to 1x12 combos, but they add a second 12 inch (30.5 cm) speaker. The 2x12 design is considerably heavier and bulkier than the 1x12, but it is still a favorite choice of working musicians for performances at small to medium-sized venues. The addition of a second speaker allows for certain stereo effects, and two speakers simply move more air than one (allowing more ""presence"" in your sound). A favorite in this category is the Roland Jazz Chorus, which features a signature sound, stereo, a clean sound, and built-in effects.

, For example, if you'd like to know what a tiny 5-watt Fender Champ sounds like in the studio, listen to Eric Clapton's guitar on Layla!

, While combo amps are great for an all-in-one solution, a lot of players like to customize their sound. They may love the sound of a Marshall cab (speaker cabinet), but only when driven by a Mesa Engineering head. Others might not be that particular about cabs, but want to be able to have several of them for a powerful wall of sound that stretches across the stage.

, A head is an amplifier without speakers. A cabinet (cab) is a stand-alone speaker enclosure, which can be connected to a head. A stack is a head and a set of cabinets connected together, ready for use.


Stacks are generally preferred for gigs rather than practice, although there's no rule against having an enormous stack in your living room—if your family allows it. Fair warning: in most cases, they won't! Stacks are physically bulky, very heavy, and devastatingly loud. These are the tools of musicians who play large venues.

, Heads are all roughly the same size physically, but they come in a variety of wattages. Small heads pack 18 to 50 watts, while full-power heads are generally 100 watts or more. There are also super heads, boasting a tinnitus-inducing 200 to 400 watts of power.


For performances at small to medium-size venues, a small head is more than enough. The smaller heads are often connected to a single 4x12 cabinet (which contains four 12 inch speakers, as the name suggests). This type of setup is known as a ""half stack,"" and it is a favorite of working musicians.
Before buying a half stack, keep in mind they are too large and too loud for most bars or venues with a small stage (most of the gigs you'll actually play), they don't fit in any vehicle smaller than a van or pickup, your band members will not help you haul it up on stage, and a half stack will cause permanent hearing damage if you don't use earplugs. The half stack offers plenty of volume, and the presence of four speakers. Use the heads (amplifier) that the professionals use.
A full stack is the dream of many a guitarist (but will be frowned upon by your sound man and everyone on stage with you). This is generally features at least a 100-watt head connected to two 4x12 cabinets. The cabinets are stacked vertically (one on top of the other), giving the setup its distinctive name.
A full stack is as tall as a grown man, making for quite an impressive sight. The sound is equally impressive. A full stack is too large for all but the very largest of venues, and even then your sound man will be mic'ing you so you'll never actually have a use for a full stack. Most working pros will use two half stacks in stereo rather than bringing a full stack on the road.
Guitarists who are truly sadistic (in a sonic sense), such as some heavy metal players, may run one of the 200-400 watt super heads through a full stack. With any full stack (and especially the ""hot rod"" setups), you will require ear protection if you wish to play at higher volumes without sustaining potentially serious ear damage.
Most live shows you see that use full stacks are doing it as a stage trick. Typically only one cabinet has speakers in it and the rest are up there for show. Mötley Crüe used to make fake speaker grille frames out of black cloth and 2x4s to make it look like the stage was full of amp stacks!

, Most pros currently use 2x12 or half stacks because the sound is easier to control. If you really want a full stack, by all means get one, but you'll almost never get to use it unless you are doing a stadium tour. They are just too big to be practical.

, Many musicians use gear racks, usually a reinforced metal box with removable panels on the front and back. The front side of the rack, when open, has two vertical rows of threaded screw holes on the sides, set 19 inches (48.3 cm) apart: the rack mount standard.


Like a head-and-cab setup, a rack-mounted guitar amplifier rig separates the amplifier components and the speaker cabinets. However, rack-mounted heads can be broken down into two categories: the preamp and the power amp. Both heads and combos have these components as well, but rack units make it practical to treat them as separate items.
Most major amplifier manufacturers, including Marshall, Carvin, Mesa-Boogie, and Peavey make rack-mountable amp rigs.

, This is the initial amplification stage: in its basic form, a preamp boosts the signal so that it can effectively drive the power amp stage. Higher-end preamps will feature various tone-shaping features, including equalization, variable tube configurations, and more.

, This is connected to the preamp, takes the signal the preamp shaped, and gives it serious, speaker-driving power. Like heads, power amps are available in different sizes, from a minimum of 50 watts to monster 400W power amps.


As many power amps as you want can be connected in a daisy chain or to different pre-amp outputs to boost the power of the signal, as well as possibly blend the tonal influences of two different power amps.

, As you can probably tell, racks are frequently very complicated rigs. A novice guitarist may find them perplexing. They are also heavier and bulkier than heads -- and add onto that the bulk and heft of the rack itself. Since you need to buy multiple products and accessories, the price for a new rack rig can be (but isn't always) higher than that of a head.

, A rack allows you to mix and match products by different manufacturers and find a tone that is distinctly yours! In addition to the preamp and power amp, there are a lot of great products that can be mounted right on the same rack with your amplifier—reverbs, delays, EQs, and other sonic delights.

Racks frequently have caster wheels, making them very easy to roll around, and having a rack can also simplify setup: your components are always ready to plug in to as soon as you wheel your rack onto the stage and power it up.






Finally, racks are uncommon, and will attract attention. People will be impressed if you wheel a rack rig into rehearsal or performance, but beware—they will expect you to be a seasoned guitarist, or at least be able to effectively use your rack. Don't bring your rack anywhere unless you know how to get those pre-amps and processors to do exactly what you want them to do. Professionals axe masters like Robert Fripp, The Edge, and Kurt Cobain have favored rack rigs.

, For the most part, amps are not ""one size fits all."" Although there are all sorts of amps, they can be classified in two broad categories: ""vintage"" and ""high gain.""

, Each style of rock has characteristic amps. Here are some general guidelines:



Vintage amps produce the classic sounds of early amplifiers. For the jazz, blues, or blues-rock guitarist, the vintage sound is still widely considered the most appropriate for the style. Vintage amps can be actual antiques, or they can be modern amps that replicate the sound of antique amps. The sound of Fender, Vox, Marshall, and similar amplifiers from the 50's, 60's and early 70's is the foundation of the vintage tone. When you think ""vintage,"" you think Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, Eric Clapton, Deep Purple, etc. These are the sounds that started it all.

High-gain amps produce a sound with greater distortion than that of vintage amps. Although there is some debate about the evolution of high-gain amps, many believe that a large part of their history is owed to Eddie Van Halen. Van Halen actually knew very little about electronics (he has admitted that is why his guitar was so oddly assembled), and only got his high gain tone by maxing out all the knobs on his amp, then brought the volume under control with a variac, which brought down the amp's voltage. With his landmark ""Eruption"" solo in 1977, Van Halen introduced the roaring, face-melting sound of an amp pushed into complete power tube saturation. Amp makers trying to emulated that sound at lower volumes then started adding extra gain stages to the preamps of their amp designs, to allow for higher gain tone at controlled volumes. As heavy metal evolved, so did the need for higher gain amps. For hard rock and heavy metal music from the early 80's and beyond, vintage amps are overshadowed by their modern high-gain counterparts.
If you want to play jazz, blues, blues-rock (in the style of Led Zeppelin) or very early heavy metal (in the style of Black Sabbath), a lower gain tube amp may be your best choice. If you want to play hard rock, 80's metal, and shred guitar (in the style of the countless 80's ""guitar heroes""), you will probably want to go with a high-gain model. Note that many newer amps can provide both high-gain and vintage sounds, although some purists feel that the only vintage amps worth playing are the actual antique amplifiers themselves. ""
Amp modeling technology (which allows one amp to simulate the sound of many different amps) is a relatively recent development which has both fans and critics—though to most people, they sound remarkably good. Modeling amps can be very useful, although if you're a purist, nothing beats walking in with a real Fender Twin Reverb, an ancient Marshall ""Plexi"" head, or something similar.

Decide whether to buy an electric, acoustic, or classical guitar.The most common guitar for a child's first is a classical style guitar.,
Figure out what size your child needs.The size guitar you choose for your child is, perhaps, the most crucial aspect affecting the child's ability to actually play the guitar.,
Consider the guitar brand.,
Think about color and design.,
Know how much you should expect to spend.Regardless of brand or design, as a general rule of thumb, the most expensive guitars will have better tone and durability.,
Make sure to purchase the right accessories.At minimum, you will need to buy extra strings.",How to Buy a Guitar for a Child," A classical guitar is an acoustic guitar with nylon strings. While acoustic guitars with metal strings are more common in the music industry, nylon strings are softer and easier for children to press down and strum. This is especially important for young children learning to play for the first time, since painful metal strings may turn them off of playing long-term.


While not as common, electric guitars are a worthwhile option, especially for children with a more energetic demeanor. They tend to be a little more expensive than an acoustic guitar, though, so many parents prefer to buy them only if they feel confident about their child's continued interest and dedication to practicing the guitar.






Consider asking your child for his or her preference. If your child has his or her heart set on a particular type of guitar, buying something different may make your child feel less inclined to continue practicing.





;
, A guitar that is too large will be impossible to play, while a guitar that is too small will teach your child to play incorrectly, making it difficult for him or her to transfer to a standard size guitar upon reaching adulthood.


In general, a 4 to 6 year old child, ranging in height from 3'3"" to 3'9"" (99 cm to 114 cm), needs a guitar that is 1/4 of the standard size.
A 5 to 8 year old child, ranging in height from 3'10"" to 4'5"" (117 cm to 135 cm), needs a guitar that is 1/2 the full size.
Children between the ages of 8 and 11 years old, ranging in height from 4'6"" to 4'11"" (137 cm to 150 cm) need a 3/4 size guitar.
Children ages 11 and up who are at least 5' (152 cm) tall can have a standard, full-size guitar.

, Brand has an impact on both the price and quality of the guitar. A higher quality guitar, like a Squier guitar made by Fender, will stay in tune remarkably well but will also be on the high end of the cost scale. You can ask the store or dealer for other recommendations based on quality that will not have as much of an impact on your budget, though. If you are uncertain about whether or not your child will stick with guitar lessons, you can also buy an inexpensive starter guitar from a respected beginner brand like J. Reynolds or Excel.

, Kids are attracted to color and print, especially at a young age. Thankfully, highly decorated guitars are not usually much more expensive than plain, simple guitars. At the very least, you should consider buying a guitar in your child's favorite color. You can also shop for a print or pattern that can appeal to your child. Guitars with Hello Kitty or other popular characters tend to be popular, as well as guitars with flames and skulls. Guitars with pretend rhinestones can be popular.

, The price of extremely high-quality guitars can run into the thousands, but you can purchase a fairly good quality guitar for a child for anywhere between $150 and $300. The difference in tone between a guitar that costs $150 and one that costs upward of $500 will not be that noticeable in child's guitar, especially if the child is still a beginner.


Moreover, if your child may outgrow the guitar in a few years, it is better to go with a less expensive one earlier on and save up for a higher quality guitar once he or she is old enough to have a full size.

, Your child will, in all likelihood, go through a fair share of strings as he or she learns to play, and you will want to have extra strings on hand to change out as soon as one breaks. You should also have a good stock of picks, since children are just as likely to lose a lot of picks, too.


If you are getting your child an electric guitar, you will also need to purchase an amplifier and a guitar cable. These do not need to be anything especially fancy, but you will at least need a simple 10-watt amp in order to make the guitar audible.
A guitar bag, guitar strap, and guitar tuner are also good accessories to buy. They are practical accessories, since they will help your child play and maintain the guitar, but they may also help make your child feel more enthusiastic about learning to play, as well, since they give some sense of authenticity to the experience.

Find someone selling a used guitar.,
Ask them how old it is.

,
Try playing a few frets.,
Place the Head-stock in front of your eyes with the guitar body away from you and look down the neck to verify it is straight.

,
Ask the person that is selling the guitar to play something on it.

,
Check if you hear any odd noises.,
Check if there is any rust on the fret bars, the strings and the knobs at the machine head.

,
If there is any rust, ask the person if he can replace it for you and then sell it for the same price.

,
Make damn well sure the strings play well.,
Lastly, check for any scratches, cracks and chips coming off the guitar at any place.,
Don't go all gung-ho on buying that same guitar now!,
Spend an entire week searching for people selling used guitars.,
Also, make sure you feel comfortable with the size of the guitar, whether your fretting fingers are too strained, etc.,
After you're done searching for guitars and have at least 3 options to choose from, choose wisely, and choose best according to sound quality, price and looks all in one.

,
Don't forget to ask for some guitar picks, spare strings, strap or a case if they can get you one.

",How to Buy a Used Guitar,";
,, Start playing all frets from top to bottom string and listen for strings ringing/rattling. If you hear a noise, verify that it is a string with broken windings rattling. If it is not a string with broken windings, then it is a fret that improperly set. The fret is the metal lines going across the guitar neck. It can also be an improperly set bridge at the bottom end of the guitar, usually white and the strings sit over it.

,,, It can be because of a dented fretboard, or a bent one.

,,, Learn to tune the guitar too. Ask the seller if he can tune it for you too.

, If the box-part is safe, no cracks, consider buying it.

, Ask the person to wait for your response.

, It's best if you go in person to see them.

, Some guitars have very hard strings to press and they might hurt you. Some fret boards might be too large for you, and all this extra stretching might get you tendinitis. DON'T quit learning guitar for some lame sounding gear. Comfort is the key.

Consider what type of music you'd like to play.,
Look at the action.,

Get it tuned up and play it in the store.,
Hook it up to an amp, and see if you like the sound.,
Have a realistic budget and stick to it.,
Go for tone with the amp.",How to Choose a Beginner Electric Guitar and Amp on a Budget,"


If you never intend to do octave high vibrato bar stuff or play music in the style of bands like PANTERA (hard, fast metal, with lots of high note bending leads), or Jimi Hendrix (psychedelic rock), then exclude any floating or fancy bridge (also called a tailpiece). Non-floating tail pieces are usually more stable (keeping tune and intonation) and cheaper to buy.
You should visit a local guitar shop to purchase your first guitar. You will benefit immensely from their experience, and they will be able to support you after the sale. Avoid places like Walmart, Best Buy, etc., because all they can do is sell you a guitar, and a poor one at that. Most local guitar shops have gone to great lengths to select guitar lines that are serviceable, and play and sound good. As a beginner, you will appreciate their service and commitment to you, even though a local shops pricing may be a touch higher. Most local shops offer lessons, as well.
Avoid mega chain music stores such as Guitar Center or Sam Ash. The customer service record is poor for the most part, and the atmosphere is not conducive to a beginner picking out their first instrument. Also, they offer no in-house service department, and no lesson studios, either.
Neck thickness. Do you want an all-around guitar, or do you have a certain style you know you are going to want to play? Slide blues players should look for a neck that is wider and has a nice arch on the backside for support. If you want to play popular metal or rock, you should go for a nice narrow neck. It's easier to move the fingers.;
, Action is the distance between the fingerboard and the string at any given time. Make sure you hear no buzzing from the guitar when playing a note at a normal weight. Try it at the 5, 10, 12, fret, etc. and listen for the 'buzz' of strings banging on the frets below it. If any guitar is like this, ask the music store (any good one will do this for you) to adjust the neck if you can try it out in playable condition. If they can adjust it for you, then there is no problem, it just needed adjustment.

, The obvious stuff.

, Some people may find this uncomfortable, being a newbie and all. If you don't want to play it, just start bending strings, up and down, using the whammy bar; think of it as 'guitar stretching'. Then see how well it stays in tune. If this guitar has no locking nuts on the head, and it still stays in tune, it's a winner. But if you have to re-tune more than a little, and almost all the strings, pass on it. You will grow frustrated by it very quickly.

, If you are new to this, your taste for tone will likely change. Just get something that sounds close to what you want. Think in terms of clarity, tinniness, depth, colour.

, Look around until you find something in your range. You can expect to find something in the $200 to $450 range for beginners.

, Try more than ten different types before you decide. You may need to buy a processor as well, so consider whether the amp has inbuilt effects or not.

String your guitar and test it.",How to Build an Electric Guitar," Before you begin, you’ll want a solid idea of what you want your instrument to look like. You can draw inspiration from a classic model like a Fender Telecaster or a Gibson SG, or make your own unique design. Once you’ve settled on a design, draw the body, full scale, on paper, and cut it out.The guitar body shape can be rounded, like a Gibson Les Paul or a Fender Stratocaster, or angled, like a Gibson Explorer or Flying V.
You can also choose a unique shape for your guitar, such as a square or circle.
Some guitarists prefer a single cutaway to access the higher frets, some like a double cutaway, or you might choose not to have a cutaway at all.;
, Many electric guitar bodies are made of swamp ash, alder, mahogany, or maple. Common woods for guitar necks include maple and mahogany. Rosewood or maple are standard choices for fingerboards.Some of these woods are rare or protected, and hard to come by. You can experiment making an electric guitar with any kind of wood you would like, however.
There is room for variation in terms of the thickness of an electric guitar body. Select a wood size based on the thickness of an existing guitar, or on what feels comfortable to you.

, There’s a lot of variety in terms of the looks and capabilities of the parts you’ll need for your guitar. You can choose based on the kind that existing guitars you like use, or experiment with something new. You can easily buy the equipment you’ll need from most guitar shops or online. For an electric guitar, you’ll need:One or more pickups (single coil or humbuckers)
A bridge
Tuning pegs
A nut
Volume and tone controls and knobs
A pickup selector switch
An input for a ¼ inch cable
A pickguard (optional)
Strap pegs (optional, but recommended)
A truss rod (optional, but recommended)
Fret wire (if you are building your own neck)
Strings

, Unless you have a lot of skill and experience in woodworking, it is recommended that you buy a pre-made neck. Since the neck is often considered the most complicated part to make, you might consider purchasing one and building the rest of the guitar yourself. You still do the rest of the work yourself., If you purchase a pre-manufactured neck, building an electric guitar doesn’t require highly sophisticated tools or expertise, but the process isn’t exactly beginner level, either. You’ll need to know how to saw, drill, sand, and solder, and have tools capable of fulfilling these tasks.It’s possible to create an electric guitar using hand tools alone. However, having access to an electric jigsaw, drill press, and router will make things much easier and faster.

, Several companies produce electric guitar kits that include all of the parts you’ll need, prepared and ready to assemble. If you just want to get your feet wet, these can be a good choice. While you won’t get the full experience of making a guitar from scratch, you’ll still get the satisfaction of putting it together and finishing it yourself., Lay the cut-out of your guitar body design on the wood you selected, and trace the design onto it. Use a jigsaw (or another saw) to cut through the wood, following the outline you drew.Sand the sides of the body blank after cutting it out. If you would like to round off the top and bottom edges of the guitar, use a sander for that as well.

, Draw a line down the center of the body blank for reference. Then, draw marks on the body blank to identify where you want hardware like volume controls and the pickups to go.You can position things like volume and tone controls, the pickup selector, and the plug input more or less wherever you like. Follow the design of an existing guitar, or choose what feels comfortable to you.
Pickups should sit under the strings, centered with the fretboard. Mark the position of the pickups by referencing the center line you drew.
The bridge needs to be positioned so that the distance between it and the nut on the neck correspond to the scale length of the neck, which varies somewhat depending on the guitar. If you purchased a pre-manufactured neck, use its scale length to position the bridge accordingly. Otherwise, most guitars have scale lengths ranging from 24-26 inches.

, You’ll need to make a cavity (a hole that goes partly through the body of the guitar) in the back of the guitar to fit the electronics for the volume, tone, pickup selection controls. You will cover it later with a bit of material (usually hard plastic). You’ll also need one cavity in the front of the guitar for each of its pickups. Rout the pickup cavity (or cavities) to the depth recommended by the manufacturer.You will also want to rout a cavity where the neck will attach to the body that is wide enough and deep enough to secure the parts together.

, Use the marks you made earlier as a guide. The number and position of the holes you’ll need will depend on the exact hardware you’re using. Generally, however, you will need holes:For the bridge hardware
For the volume, tone, and pickup selector controls
To allow the pickup wires to pass from the front cavity to the back one
To fit the cord input in place
For the strap pegs (if you are using them)

, Much of the creativity that comes from making your own guitar shows in the way the body looks, so use your imagination here. The possibilities are endless! You might try:An oil finish to give your guitar a natural look
A colorful paint and either a high-gloss or matte finish
Multiple colors to create a striking pattern
Painting an image or design on the body for a standout look

, If you purchased a pre-manufactured neck (recommended), skip this step. If not, you’ll need to cut the guitar neck to the width and thickness you prefer. Leave the headstock end wider to accommodate the tuning pegs. Round off the back of the neck (using a belt sander, for instance) until it has a comfortable profile.Neck widths are usually about 1.5–1.75 inches (3.8–4.4 cm) at the nut, and widen slightly as the frets get higher.
Make the headstock whatever contour you like.
Routing a hole through the length of the neck to insert a truss rod is recommended, but not required.
If you are adding a fingerboard to your neck, cut a thin piece of wood to the same width as the neck, and glue it on top. Round the edges of the fingerboard to give it a “radius.”
Cut fret wire to size for each fret, then gently tap the frets in place, then file their edges smooth. Measurements need to be highly precise, so use a spacing template (available online).Glue the nut where the fingerboard meets the headstock.
Attach the tuning pegs to the headstock, drilling holes if necessary.

, Attach the neck to the body where you previously made a cavity for this purpose. You can glue the neck in, or run bolts through the back of the body and the neck to fix it in place., There are a number of types of bridges, so the exact directions for attaching yours will depend on its design. The simplest varieties, however, simply require a few screws to fix the bridge in place.

, Run the pickup wires through the holes you previously drilled. Drop the pickups into the cavities on the front of the guitar body, and fix them into place with the screws provided by the manufacturer. Do the same for the volume, tone, and pickup selector controls, as well as the input for the guitar cord., The pickups you purchased should come with a schematic that shows exactly how to connect these to the controls and to the input for the guitar cord. Follow this schematic, using an ordinary electronics soldering iron to complete the job. Wrap any wiring connections with electrical tape, unless the manufacturer’s instructions suggest another method.


Once the electronics are in, cut a piece of hard plastic to cover the cavity you created in the back of the guitar body. Fix it in place with small screws.

, Use your favorite string gauge. After they’re in place, try playing your guitar a bit unplugged to make sure everything feels right. Then, plug your guitar in and play. If all has gone well, the guitar is done!You might need to make small adjustments to perfect the guitar's intonation, such as changing the bridge pins or saddle height. If you need help doing this, take your guitar to a local shop.

First, you'll want to consider the age and the dominant hand of the recipient.,
Choose between Acoustic or Electric.,
Be careful when buying a relatively cheap beginner's guitar (about $100 give or take, and you may even find a package deal that comes with an amp and an array of accessories perhaps even an educational DVD).,
When you buy a used guitar, you can get a much better guitar for the same money.,
.

,
Look everywhere you can before making a purchase.",How to Buy a Guitar for a Beginner," A right handed person typically holds the neck of the guitar with their left hand. A left handed person holds the neck with their right hand. However, it could be that he/she wants to strum with the non-dominant hand so it is easier to operate the fretboard with the dominant hand, so let him/her experiment with the preference.If a person is left handed there is a neat little test that can help determine whether buying a lefty guitar or a righty guitar will be best for them.First have the person clap their hands as they normally would and watch. How do they clap their hands is their right hand mostly still while the left hand does most of the clapping? If this is so then a lefty guitar would suit this left-hander best. If both hands are doing equal clapping then it should be up to the left-hander to decide.;
, Typically electric guitar strings aren't as rough on a child's fingers the way that an acoustic guitar can be. If you go the electric route they probably will want an amp too. By all means go cheap and small. Make sure the amp has a headphone jack that mutes the speaker when connected. Some amps are in the headphone itself which just plugs into the guitar.


Some brands make smaller versions of their full size models. Think of the guitars that Hendrix or Clapton usually played on because you can easily find a cheap child sized one like that. The benefit is that scale is shorter, easier to reach with smaller hands. The string tension will will be lower than the full scale model (the strings won't be so stiff or hard to press on) and this makes it easier for weaker fingers to build strength.

, You may find that the guitar is poorly set up. That means that it will be hard to play and to tune correctly., Bring along a friend who is more experienced- He or she can weed out the damaged or unplayable guitars. Hint: The best deal is a middle priced guitar owned by an adult. It is much less likely that a mature person, who has spent his/her own money, will abuse their guitar. Often they look brand new. The other advantage to buying used is, if you should decide to stop playing and sell your used guitar, you will likely be able to sell it for about what you paid. Absolutely do not buy from a teenager, the vast majority do not know how to take care of a guitar. (Sorry teens)

,, Look online for prices, but buy in a local music store. Sometimes local music stores will compete with online store pricing. So don't be afraid to ask if you see the same instrument in a store that was cheaper online. Shipping will be a factor due to size and weight, but shouldn't be much. Buy locally, the store employees can be a big help when buying and after you bought as well. .

Stretch your fingers.,
Do hand exercises.,
Practice speed drills.",How to Avoid Pain in the Left Hand While Playing the Guitar1," The strength of your muscles is secondary to the flexibility and agility of your muscles. One way to improve the latter two attributes is by properly stretching your fingers before practice. Bend back each finger until it feels comfortable and hold them in that position for several seconds. Do the same for each thumb, but also stretch your thumb into your palm.


Get the blood flowing through your fingers by pretending to type rapidly in the air.
Roll your wrests both clockwise and counterclockwise.
Spread your fingers out into a fully extended position, then release the tension.;
, After stretching out your hand, you can strengthen the muscles you commonly use during guitar play. There are two main exercises you can do without playing the guitar itself. Work out the extensor muscles of your fretting hand with these two exercises:


First hold your left hand (or fretting hand) in a relaxed position. Extend your thumb to your pinky and then pull them apart slightly. Continue this motion with the rest of your fingers: ring, middle, and then your index finger. Repeat as many times as you want, but don’t over-exercise your muscles.
Hold your fretting hand relaxed with your palm facing up. Extend your pinky finger slightly and then flex it. Continue the same exercise with the rest of your fingers: ring, middle, and then your index finger., After properly warming up your hand, you can practice a few lines on your guitar. Set a metronome, if available, to a comfortable tempo. For beginners, use 80 bpm, and experienced players can play at around 120 bpm. Set your hand so your index finger is on the first fret. Then play this chromatic riff across each string: 1-2-3-4. Use an individual finger to play each fret.


For an added exercise, do the same motion in a descending order. Start with your pinky on the fourth fret of the last string.
This technique will exercise each finger.Once you become comfortable performing this exercise, increase the speed of your metronome.

"
"
Hold the guitar properly.,
Have the proper finger placement.,
Relax your posture.,
Take productive breaks.",How to Avoid Pain in the Left Hand While Playing the Guitar2," The way you hold the neck of the guitar effects how long you can barre chords before your hand cramps and hurts. Anchor your thumb close the center-back of the neck and not over-the-top as if it was peeking from the fretboard. Placing your thumb in the center-back of the guitar's neck should help you with the proper form. The proper form will increase your hand’s stamina.Look at the angle of your arm and wrists. You will notice that the more acute the angle of your wrist, the less strength you have in that hand. Keep all your joints from your wrist to your fingers at natural rounded angles.
There isn’t a golden rule with hand placement. Jimi Hendrix held his guitar in a way that his thumb wrapped around the guitar. Do whatever makes you comfortable. In this example, you’d hold the guitar like a tennis racket.

, The proper finger placement helps your sound and your hand's stamina. Place your fingers close to the fret that is closest to the bridge, instead of placing your finger dead-center between the frets. This helps decrease the force needed to barre chords.


You should also get into the habit of arching each finger when playing notes or chords. This way your fingers don't touch other strings and hinder the sound., It is common to feel stressed and strained while playing the guitar. This is especially true for beginner guitarist. It is normal to feel pain when trying out a new guitar shape. When reaching for these tougher hand shapes, it’s important to take note of how the rest of your body is reacting. Make sure you have the proper fingering, then take a deep breath and let your shoulders rest.


Stiffness will only hinder a musician. Keep a relaxed posture to work the instrument into a natural position and feeling., When you are practicing the guitar for longer periods of time, make sure you take breaks. A good guitarist will take productive breaks to ensure the practicing mentality isn’t lost. Take a five minute break to drink water or go on a walk. Avoid sitting on the couch and watching TV on your break.


Maintain your desire to improve as a guitarist. Keep a musical biography around to keep you inspired.

Adjust the action of your guitar’s neck.,
Try different neck shapes.,
Seek medical assistance if pain persists.",How to Avoid Pain in the Left Hand While Playing the Guitar3," A guitar with high action will require more force from your fingers to press the strings down. You can adjust the truss rod on most guitars with an allen wrench. It is easy to damage your neck, and you should take your guitar to a trusted repair shop for an easy adjustment.If you cannot afford to have your guitar's action fixed by a repair technician, consider using a capo on the first fret of the guitar as a temporary alternative. Placing a capo on the first fret helps bring the strings closer to the frets.
Older guitars require you to remove the neck to access the truss rod.

, Neck shapes play a major role in the comfort of playing. Different brands and styles of guitar offer many neck styles and shapes to their customers. Always try out a guitar before buying it. Similar to buying a new pair of shoes, you want to try out guitars that not only sound great, but also feel right.


You can also change your the neck of your current guitar. The process isn't too complex and it could be a more economical solution.
Fat necks are usually viewed in the guitar world as sturdy and reliable necks. This style of neck could be difficult for beginners. Try out several styles of necks before making any decisions.

, Prepare for soreness and stiffness. With that in mind, a novice guitarist should not expect to have the same level of stamina exhibited by a more experienced guitarist. If pain in your fretting hand persists for longer than two days, you should let a doctor examine your hand. You body lets you know something is wrong whenever pain becomes acute. Unlike weightlifting, where some pain is gain, in the guitar world persistent pain could mean trouble.

",How to Afford an Expensive Guitar," Some guitars are around $1000, or if you're in the market for a Les Paul, $3500. Basically get the best guitar you can afford to get at the time. It makes a difference.;
, They might have to put it under their name if you are under 18.

, Only withdraw the money when you're going to buy the guitar.

, It is very important that you decide the exact make and model and that you stick to it.

, Don't only go to the extremely large ones, but try to find some small, privately owned ones also. Check there for your guitar and start writing down the store name, price, whether it is new or used, and what condition it is in. This should start to get you a good idea of how much it will cost.

, Don't get anxious and buy the first guitar you see. You need to wait it out. After 2 or 3 months, you will find an amazing deal., They will help you decide if it is in good enough condition, and will keep you from buying it on impulse. Don't be afraid to do this more than once. If the guitar is not right for you, keep waiting.

, Guitar stores always mark up prices, and with a little pressure, you can make them bring it down, especially if it is used.

Good things to say:

""Well, I don't really have quite enough right now...""
""I think I saw it cheaper at (insert store).""
""Um... I think I'm going to shop around a little more... maybe find a better deal.""
""If you take 100 bucks off the price, I'll take it off your hands right now.""

Start playing songs.",How to Strum a Guitar," Keep the guitar balanced on your thigh, tight into your body. To learn to strum the guitar properly, you need to keep the elbow of your strumming hand out of the way of the string, near the base of the guitar, so you can use your wrist to strum. Support the guitar neck with your fret hand. The thumb should be positioned just past the center of the neck (opposite the strings).









If you have to use your arms to hold up the guitar, it’s very difficult to strum properly. Let the weight of the guitar rest on your lap, securing it with your elbow and make sure you can move your strumming hand without moving the guitar.;
, With the palm of your hand facing your body, curl all your fingers in toward your palm. Place the pick on the first knuckle of your pointer-finger, so it points straight toward your chest. Grasp it with your thumb securely, leaving only a few centimeters of clearance from your finger. Play around some to get a good and comfortable grip on the pick.









Alternatively, you can strum without a pick, using the thumb of your non-fretting hand. Johnny Cash never used a pick. That choice depends on whether you can get enough clear sound with your fingers. Practice with a pick and abandon it if you find it too troublesome and like the sound of your fingers on the strings better.
It can be somewhat painful on your strumming fingers to not use a pick. Building up calluses is always a good thing, though.

, The action refers to the height of the strings off the fret board, and the strength in your fretting finger needed to play the strings. Practice making chords properly and getting a clean sound on all the strings at once.









Strums will sound rattle-like if you strike “dead strings” that you’re not fully fretting. It can be quite frustrating to try to learn to strum if you’re not making the chords properly. If your strums sound dry or like a rattle, stop strumming and reform the chord correctly.

, Practice strumming the strings in different places to get a sense of the sound it creates. Strumming directly over the sound hold will create a ""bass-ier"", ""boom-ier"" sound, while strumming closer to the bridge will give you a sharper, tinnier sound.









While there’s really no “right” place, generally, you want to aim your strums about an inch south of the sound hole. Play around with your particular guitar to get a sense of where you like the sound best., In time, try strumming a simple first-position chord, like a G chord, with down strokes. Play quarter notes, one strum each, trying your best to hit all the strings. Stay on tempo, counting your four strums per measure.









Starting with the low E string, strum all the strings, trying to give them all equal weight. It can be difficult at first to make it sound like a “chord,” letting all the strings ring more or less the same. Beginners tend to hit either E string, the first or last, a little harder.

, When you’re comfortable doing that on beat, try strumming the guitar from the little E string to the low. This is called an upstroke. These can be somewhat more difficult, but you still want to practice getting all the strings more or less equally, letting the chord “thrum” out like one big sound, rather than raking over them all individually and slowly.








, A good strum is all in the wrist. You’ll be able to spot a beginner easily from the flailing about of the strumming arm, strumming from the elbow. Learn to keep your elbow tight into the instrument, using your wrist to strum.









Many novice guitar players find it difficult to hold onto the pick while learning to strum. Most pick problems are the result of hanging on too close to the base of the pick and letting it flop around. Make sure you’re holding it properly, letting only the tiniest amount of the point stick out of your fingers.

, The most basic rhythmic strumming pattern you can learn is to alternate down strokes and upstrokes with every beat: (DUDUDUDU) Down Up, Down Up, Down Up, Down Up. Keep the same tempo, but try a down-up strum for every beat, dividing the quarter notes into eighth notes.









Instead of one stroke for every beat, you’ll have two strokes for every beat. These are eighth notes. It should be the same tempo, so keep tapping your foot at the same rate, but strum twice for every beat.

, When you get comfortable with your down strokes and your upstrokes on one chord, change it up. Switch from a G chord to a C chord every measure, then every two beats, practicing changing chords in time.









Take your time learning this and getting the changes down. It might be slow going, but you’ll be better off for the work you put into it now. Moving on to the next step before you’re comfortable changing chords will be frustrating and discouraging to your sound. Get the chord changes worked out and you’ll be playing songs in no time.

, Almost no songs involve a straight up-down pattern, and it would be boring to play the same pattern over and over. Leave out one down stroke and see how the pattern changes: (DUDUDU-U). Where you would have played the down stroke, play nothing.









To start learning more complicated strumming patterns, you have to learn how to leave out certain up or down strokes, while still maintaining the same up and down pattern in your hand. In other words, you’ll continue moving your wrist, but leave your pick off the strings.

, A familiar strum pattern you’ll hear at lots of open-mics and practice sessions is (D-D-U-U-DU).








Start listening actively to your favorite songs that feature acoustic guitar prominently to get some sense of the strumming pattern used. Now that you know the basics, you can start learning to vary your strumming patterns, leaving out particular strokes to achieve different effects in the song.

, Another way to add some variations to your strumming patterns is to learn to dampen the strings with the ball of your strumming palm, maintaining the pattern but getting a more percussive effect when you strike the strings with your pick.









Neil Young has a distinctive, bottom-heavy strumming pattern that he uses along with string dampening, and acoustic guitarist-surfer-popstar Jack Johnson also has a distinctive damp-strumming style that’s easy to learn and sounds fancier than it actually is.

, Beginning guitar players often “over-strum,” focusing too much on doing the pattern they learned and too little on the tempo, the clarity of the chord, and playing the song. When strumming, try to focus on the chords first, then onto the strumming pattern. You’ll sound like a pro in no time.








, Guitar’s a lot more fun when you’re actually playing chord patterns and songs that you know! Start out with an easy song that will teach you basic strumming patterns.









You can play almost any country and folk song using the first position chords G, C, and D. Pick a few to learn and practice them to get the strumming patterns figured out.
Identify the chords you have to play in a song you’d like to learn and determine the amount of strings to strum. D Major, for example, only requires strumming five strings, while G Major requires strumming all six.

Dedicate time to practice guitar every day.,
Spend time each day on the ""boring"" technical skills necessary for good guitar players.,
Try to teach yourself your favorite songs by ear.,
Learn to read tablature (""tab""), the most common written form of guitar music.,
Supplement your practice with music theory to expand your range across the guitar.,
Refine the tone of your guitar to truly shine on stage.,
Push yourself to learn new styles and songs outside your comfort zone.,
Take lessons, play with a more experienced guitarist, or enroll in an online class.",How to Be a Good Guitar Player1," Study after study has shown that regular, consistent practice is far more effective than big chunks here and there. If you want to be a good guitar player, you need to practice at least 6-7 days a week.That said, not all practice is created equally, and the following steps will help you make the most of your time each day you sit down.


Practice should always be focused. That means all your mental energy is on guitar, not practicing with the TV in the background.
Don't try to learn five new techniques a day -- it's much better to perfect 1-2 at a time.
The more time spent practicing, the better you'll be. This is the most important thing you can do to be a good guitarist.;
, Shredding an incredible solo is not some skill that is trained on its own. It is the culmination of many technical exercises and hard practice. Think of the following exercises like a painter mixing up her paints -- these are the small but essential skills needed to create your art on stage. Consider just 5 minutes of the following exercises each time you practice:


Running up and down through all of your scales.
Learning 1-2 new chords and strumming them to a metronome
Repeated picking exercises (search online and find your favorites)
Speed-picking practice (alternating picking, downstrokes only, and sweeping)

, Learning by ear is when you teach yourself a song just by listening to it. Before the internet, this was one of the only ways to learn a song, but there is more to the activity than just memorizing the notes. Learning by ear trains you to understand the guitar intuitively -- instead of thinking about what note needs to come up, you start to think about what notes will sound right before your even play it. You ear and your fingers become synced up much more smoothly.


When learning by ear, work in small sections. Get a few notes perfectly right, then slowly add more.
Trying to get chords right is difficult, but just work slowly. Figure out all of the root notes first, then try to determine what types of chords fit into the song., Tablature, or guitar tab, is a simple and intuitive way to write out guitar parts. You'll see six lines, much like a musical staff, with numbers on each line. The six lines correspond to your six strings, with your heavy E string on the bottom and your thinnest e string on the top. The numbers tell you which fret on that string to play, and you read from left to right. Thus, the following tab would tell you to ""play the 3rd string, 2nd fret, then play an A minor chord:""


|e|--------|-------------|
|B|--------|------1------|
|G|------ -|------2------|
|D|---2---|------2------|
|A|--------|------0------|
|E|--------|-------------|

, Music theory may seem dull and boring, but it actually opens up thousands of new ideas, scales, and chords for you to use. Think of it this way -- would you rather have to memorize which chords and scales go with which, or would your rather of the blueprints to create any song you can imagine? Music theory, of course, is a huge field, but some good places to start include:


The circle of 5ths.
Major and Minor scale composition
The use of ""modes.""
Common chord progressions., While not nearly as important as technical practice and skills, good guitarists know that what they play is only part of the battle. How your guitar actually sounds, whether acoustic or electric, will help shape your tone and personal style, so take some time to research and experiment with the guitar, amp, pedals, and strings that work for you.


String gauge is an easy way to change your tone -- thicker strings sound deeper, with more bass, while thinner strings sound high and bright.
If you're an acoustic guitarist, the size of the guitar's body is the major factor in changing tone. Luckily, most music shops will let you test any guitar you want before buying.
Electric guitarists have the most freedom, as you can tinker with effects pedals and amp combinations to perfectly refine your sound., Good music is good music no matter what genre it is, and the best guitarists know that inspiration can come from anywhere. Different types of music use chords, scales, and rhythmic ideas that you may never think of, but can open up wholly new avenues as a guitarist:


Drop the pick and play with your fingers. A pick may seem necessary, but guitar gods like Mark Knopfler and Jeff Beck prove otherwise.
Cover a few songs in a genre you don't normally play -- what does it sound like ""converted"" to your favorite style of music?
Try to figure out the parts for other instruments, like trumpet solos or bass lines, to get a fresh perspective of melodic composition.
If you're a lead player, write some rhythm parts (or vice versa)., Take classes, get a book, watch an instructional video, or join one-on-one lessons -- whatever teaching style you prefer, seek some outside guidance to kick-start your learning. It seems obvious, but you cannot teach yourself what you don't know. A dedicated teacher or set of lessons will help you improve much more quickly than you can on your own.


No matter what avenue you take, make sure you're still enjoying yourself. A teacher is no good for your development if they take all of the fun away."

Practice every day, for about 30-90 minutes.,
Get your band mates or some other musicians to play with.,
Build an audience of friends or family to watch.,
Record your performance in front of the small audience and compare it to a recording of you playing the piece alone.,
Asses the location of the performance in advance.,
On the day of the performance, play for a small group at the venue beforehand, if possible.

This will allow you to learn chords and scales in the future and get better at learning how to play songs. We are going to be discussing the string order on a standard six string guitar. Seven string and eight string guitars will have a different string order.The top string is the thickest string and it is E. The order then goes from the thickest string E, to the thinnest string, low e. The order is: E, A, D, G, B, e.
It may be tricky to remember the string order so you can use the anagram, Eat All Day, Go to Bed Early.;
, Learning how to play chords will do two things: it'll get your fingers used to the guitar, and it'll allow you to play at least a simplified version of pretty much any song. You should look up chords for right handed players if you play with your right hand and chords for left handed players if you play with your left hand.








Start by playing guitar chords very slowly. Take your time and try to play each note clearly. Practice holding the strings down and making the chord shapes. Try to hold the chords with your non-dominant, or non-playing hand and strumming the strings with your dominant, playing hand.You may start by following chord diagrams, online or printed out on paper, to help you visualize the basic chords. The chord diagrams will label each string with their corresponding note (E, A, D, G, B, e) and the order you are playing the notes to make a guitar chord.You can look up basic chord diagrams online or through a guitar chords app on your phone. Use your knowledge of the string order on your guitar to learn basic chords. You can then move on to more complex chords once you have mastered the basics.

, Basic scales will help you become familiar with the notes you can play on guitar. They aid in the process of knowing where your fingers should land if you're reading a piece of music for the first time. For playing lead guitar, knowing scales is essential.








You can start by learning the major scales on the guitar and then move on to more complex or obscure scales. Learning new songs will also push you to try different scales and patterns on the guitar so you are a more well rounded player., Start by breaking up your guitar neck into blocks of four frets. Each section of the guitar neck will contain four frets that you can use to play major scales. You will then use a pattern, or series of notes, to play major scales in each section of the guitar neck.








To play scales, you will need to first locate the key of the scale. The key is determined by the first and last notes of the scale. So if you are playing a scale in C major, you would start the scale on the C major note, located on the eighth fret. Then, you would play the pattern over and over again, running through each note.
An example major scale pattern can be found online.
There are a number of resources online for learning scales, including this one and this one.

, Once you have practiced a few scales in the same key, switch it up and practice playing to same scale in different keys. Challenge yourself to learning scales in each key of the guitar so you have increased range and get more comfortable playing at different keys.








You should also focus on accessing all of the frets on the guitar, moving up and down the guitar neck. Try to play scales that start at the lower frets of the guitar and avoid playing in only the keys you are comfortable with playing. Many guitar players make the mistake of practicing the scales in the same area of the guitar, which can lead to boredom and underdeveloped playing skills.

, Guitar music is most often not written in sheet music form; it's written in tablature. This is a way of writing music down to read that is unique to guitar. It's also fairly easy to read. Tabs are formatted to mimic the fretboard of a guitar visually. You'll see six lines when you look at a tab, and each line represents one of the six strings, starting with the thickest at the bottom.You read the tab from left to right. You'll see little numbers on the lines that represent the strings. Each number tells you how far up the string that note is. So if you see a number 2 on the E string, you should play the second fret on the E string. Then you just play the notes in the order as they're written. The only weakness of tablature is that it doesn't give you the exact rhythm that the notes are played in. You'll have to listen to the song to get that down.

, Before you start practicing a song, you may want to warm up your hands by playing a few exercises on the guitar. You can listen to audio of the warm up online and then try to play along to the audio or play it from memory. Warming up can get your hands and brain the mindset for practicing tabs.








You can find simple warm up chords and scales online. You should try doing different warm ups to improve your finger dexterity and speed. This may come in handy when you are trying to learn how to play songs., To get better at reading tabs, you should look up the tabs for your favorite guitar song or songs. Start with less complex tabs first and then move on to more difficult tabs. Study the tabs and note where the chord changes as well as the major scales used in the song. You can then break down the song and practice each section of the song using the tabs.









Tabs will be notated by string, such as E or A, and numbers, which notate the fret. For example, if the first line says “e”, that is the low “e” string, which is the sixth string of the guitar. Then, the first line may say “3-3-3-3-3”, that means you play the “e” string in the third fret.
You can find the tabs of many major rock, pop, and jazz songs online on sites like Ultimate Guitar Tabs. Many tabs will come with audio of the song so you can play along to the audio.

, Challenge yourself to learn one new song a week to improve your playing. You may start with a certain genre of music, like rock, and then challenge yourself to try a new song in a different genre, like jazz or pop. Look for songs that have unique or interesting chord changes as these will allow you to learn how to play new melodies and sounds.


You may want to consider playing with someone else who is also learning how to play guitar and challenging each other on learning different songs once a week. You can then help each other improve on technique and playing.

, If you have a favorite guitar driven song that has a wicked guitar solo, look up the tabs for that solo and practice it on guitar. Doing this will allow you to listen closely to how some of your favorite guitarist use chords and scales to great effect. A big part of being a good guitar player is learning how to play with feeling and style. Listening and mimicking your favorite guitar solos can help you work on these elements.








One option is to listen to a guitar solo you love and transcribe it by ear. Then, try to play the solo on your own using your transcription and your memory of the solo. This can help you get better at listening closely to guitar solos and the individual playing styles of the guitarists you love.

, There are several Youtube channels online that are made to help people just starting out on guitar. They will walk you through everything from chords, to scales, to arpeggios, and more. Find one or two that you like and use them as a resource in your practice.








Some of these Youtube channels include https://www.youtube.com/user/martyzsongs and https://www.youtube.com/user/tomas6750.

, A metronome is a device that provides regular, metrical beats or clicks at a certain speed, known as beats per minute. Using a metronome when you practice your playing can allow you to get better at playing tight and on beat. It can also allow you to test your speed and dexterity when you play.








You can download an app on your phone that can act as a metronome and set the metronome at different speeds or beats per minute. Then, try to play an original song or an existing song at that speed.
The idea is that as you play, the metronome click should disappear or go into the background against the strong beats of the music. If your playing is in perfect time, your notes will line up right on top of the metronome click, and you will no longer be able to hear the sound of the metronome., Another way you can improve your playing speed and finger dexterity is to challenge yourself to do several timed guitar drills a day. You may try to run through all the scales and chords on the guitar within a certain time frame or challenge yourself to learn and plan the tabs of a song within a certain period of time. Set up a timer and force yourself to commit to a timeframe so your practices feel more like short drills that allow you to get better at your playing.









You can find guitar exercises like fretting combinations, ascending and descending quads, and chord changes on the Guitar Lesson World website.

, Once you feel you have reached a certain level of playing, you may try to expand your playing abilities by trying more complex techniques like finger picking or hybrid picking. These techniques can add personality and variety to your playing as well as challenge you to try different styles.








To do finger picking, you will need position your hand so you are using your thumb, index, middle, and ring fingers for picking. You will then use these fingers to pluck certain strings, creating a cool technique that you can integrate into an original song or as an original flourish on an existing song.To do hybrid picking, you will use a pick to play strings usually played by your thumb finger. You will then use your middle, ring, and pinkie fingers to pluck the higher strings on the guitar. Hybrid picking is popular in country music and for playing riffs in rock n roll.

Push yourself past your most common strumming patterns.,
Practice daily with a metronome, percussionist, or both.,
Learn to dampen bum notes to clean up your chords.,
Teach yourself 1-2 new chords a week.,
Use capos to place difficult-to-sing songs into your vocal range.,
Learn the value of groove by paying close attention to bass and drum techniques.,
Use dynamics, or volume control, to create unique and captivating rhythm parts.,
Experiment with alternate tunings.",How to Be a Good Guitar Player2," If you've been playing guitar for any period of time, you'll likely start to notice that you naturally fall into the same strumming patterns each time you play or write a song. The best way to avoid this is to try and duplicate strumming patterns from your favorite artists, pushing yourself to widen your rhythmic tool belt.


Can you mix some single notes into your strumming? For example, a very country-western technique is to pick the root note, then strum the chord separately right afterwards.
Remember to strum both up and down when playing.
How can you use muted strings (by lifting your fingers lightly off the frets) to get a percussive sound in your strumming? Check the Violent Femmes for good examples., A rhythm guitarist, it goes without saying, needs to be able to stay in rhythm. The problem is that a guitarist's primary training is in melody, as drummers generally provide the rhythm for you to follow along to. However -- the ability to stay perfectly and precisely in time separates the amateurs from the pros, as perfect rhythm has an indescribable ability to make people dance.


Spend at least 5-10 minutes a day on a metronome, if not the entire practice session.
Always start at a pace where you can play the notes perfectly instead of rushing through. Gradually up the tempo as you get faster.
Many metronomes can be set to click off for a few beats, forcing you to stay in time on your own before they come back in. This is a great way to test yourself., Many times, especially with electric guitars and distortion, playing too many notes at once can sound muddled or messy. Many jazz chords require skipping strings in the middle of the chord to sound correct. Great guitarists pull this off but using the pads of their fingers to dampen the strings below the strings they're fretting. For example, the following jazz chord is formed by using the bottom of your middle finger to mute the A string, allowing you to freely strum all six strings without the A sounding out:


|e|----7----|
|B|----7----|
|G|----7----|
|D|----6----|
|A|----x----|
|E|----7----|, Ideally, you want chords that you can play with chords you already know, which helps you practice transitioning from one to the other. Dig deep into every chord you can find, from simple power chords to complex jazz shapes. To effectively learn a chord:


Practice forming the shape from nothing. Take your hand off the guitar, then place it down in the chord shape. Repeat until it feels automatic.
Practice getting to the chord from other chord shapes.
Play or learn a song with the chord in it.
Review your new chords each day until memorized., A capo simply shortens the neck of the guitar, allowing you to play open chords starting at any point. This means you can change the key of a song without actually changing the shape or order of any of your chords, allowing you to play the song in any key you can sing it. Effective capo use is essential for a rhythm guitarist or singer/songwriter.

, As part of the rhythm section, you are responsible for keeping the song grooving both melodically and rhythmically. If you're in a band, you need to be locked into these other musicians so that you're always in time, hitting each note in unison to give the song power. If you're playing all alone, it's twice as important to get this groove down:


Learn the basics of bass guitar and/or drums to get more in touch with the tempo and timing aspects of rhythm guitar.Focus on playing every note together as a rhythm section. This perfect synchronicity is the essence of a good groove.
When playing alone you have a lot more freedom with rhythm. The best way to ""groove"" is to know the song so well it's automatic, letting you feel the energy of the song and audience instead of thinking about the next chord., Work on a smooth transition from dead silence to powerful strumming, or picking individual notes in between fuller chords. Your ability to modulate tone and volume is a great way to create tension and release in a song, building drama and energy.


When playing with a band, try to sync up with the drummer. When he takes some volume off, you should too.
If playing alone, use volume control to manipulate the energy of the song. Try starting slow, then building up to a triumphant or climactic song. See John Butler's ""Oceans"" for a good example., New tunings open up new sounds, new chords, and can make certain chords or progressions far easier to play. A good way to start is by learning some famous songs in other tunings -- the Led Zeppelin (""Hey Hey What Can I Do"") & Rolling Stones (""You Can't Always Get What You Want"") catalogs particularly good places to start. Guitarists Jimmy Page and Kieth Richards both lean heavily on alternate tunings.


Start with open tunings, which are when the guitar hits a chord without holding down any frets. This allows you to play more open notes, giving the whole song a brand new texture.
Even dropping your low-E string a half step will give you a slightly richer, deeper tone overall, as seen in Led Zeppelin's ""Hey Hey What Can I Do."""
"
Make sure your lead lines service the song, not overshadow it.,
Pay attention to a note's expression, not just the notes themselves.,
Build solos like stories instead of just tossing out technical fireworks.,
Start improvising to your favorite songs and backing tracks.,
Study rhythm guitar to immerse yourself in chords, structure, and solo ideas.,
Jam with other musicians and guitarists.,
Dive into modes -- slightly different scale forms with specific moods and tones.",How to Be a Good Guitar Player3," The best lead guitarists don't just know what to play, but when to play it. In particular, lead lines tend to muddle up singing, and so most guitarists tend to fill in the gaps between words instead of playing on top of them. Your goal, always, is to be a part of the song, not to try and stand out on top of it. Other strategies to consider include:


Letting your lead lines mimic the song, such as playing the melody the singer sings or synchronizing with the bass line.
Using lead lines to transition in and out of intros, choruses, bridges, etc. instead of constantly playing them.
Making each note count instead of seeing how many notes you can play.

, For a masterclass in expression, listen to B.B. King. On paper, many of his solos don't seem that impressive. But live, when you hear the incredible emotion and tone he drips on every note, you realize why he is one of the greatest to ever live. If you focus on making each note compelling and enjoyable your solos will become exponentially better. Remember that the guitar is a physical instrument-- get physical with the strings:


Vibrato, or shaking a note back and forth, is a great way to drag a note out artfully.
Bending into and out of notes allows to literally ""manhandle"" the note into the tone you want.
Slides let you move gracefully around the fretboard, gliding notes into one another
Hammer-ons and pull-offs help your play quick sets of notes with extra emphasis and speed., It may sound cliche, but Jimmy Page's ""Stairway to Heaven"" solo is a masterclass in how to build a compelling, gripping guitar solo. Think like a storyteller -- with rising action, a climax, and a resolution. ""Stairway's"" solo starts slow, building power until it crescendos in the blistering licks the song is known for.


Don't ever play your best stuff first -- save it for the climax.
Restraint is key. Remember that what is hardest to play is not always what sounds best.
Find a ""home base"" lick to keep coming back to if you get lost in the scale. This gives your solo a recognizable structure or theme as well.
Tension is caused by contrasts -- a fast section sounds far quicker when played after a slow one., Even if the lines and solos in your band's songs are usually written in advance, improvisation is one of the top ways to explore the fretboard and expand your musical creativity. Improvising is, naturally, a personal effort, so you can and should go about it however you'd like. Some good ways to get started include:


Look up backing tracks on YouTube, like ""Blues in A-minor,"" to play basic scales along to.
Learn your favorite solos, then experiment with rearranging the notes in new ways over the same song.
Get a guitar partner, make up a quick chord progression, and trade solos back and forth, alternating the rhythm player.

, One of the biggest mistakes a lead guitarist can make is thinking they're better than or above the rhythm player. Nothing is further than the truth, as the best lead players must know chords inside and out. Think of it this way -- a chord is simply a collection of single notes all played at once, meaning all of these notes are plum for the picking in lead lines. If you know the rhythm section backward and forwards you'll be able to write unique, blistering lead lines and solos to mesh with it.


It's generally good practice to be able to play the rhythm section proficiently before crafting lead lines., Music is a shared art form and one that can be learned much faster with others. You pick up tricks, share and receive new chords or scales, and learn to play on the edge of your seat. Playing with others is the closest you can get to being on stage while still practicing. Furthermore, surrounding yourself with better musicians is the fastest way to get better yourself. When jamming, remember to:Play both rhythm and lead. No one likes a solo hog.
Ask questions if you're confused. Learn the chords in the beginning, not when it's your partner's chance to solo.
Play with the other instruments, not on top of them. When everyone is playing together, everyone sounds better., A mode is simply a set of notes in the major or minor scale that you highlight instead of playing the entire scale. In a sense, they are entirely new scales to play, though they take a little study to master. Pick one below that sounds good and look it up online. Each mode emphasizes certain notes to get totally different moods and styles:


Ionian -- your basic major scale
Dorian -- a bluesy minor key sound.
Phrygian -- a Spanish-sounding minor mode
Lydian -- very close to the major scale, but with a slight cool-jazz tint
Mixolydian -- a bluesy major key sound
Aeolian -- an almost identical minor key, but playable over major chords
Locrian -- very unstable sounding mode, sometimes used in death metal and atonal jazz."

Learn the basics thoroughly.,
Study musical notation.,
Practice every day.,
When learning a piece or song, choose one that you are comfortable with.,
Try to finish a piece, no matter how difficult it may be.,
Have patience and reasonable expectations.,
Listen to different guitarists.,
Record your guitar-playing.",How to Be a Good Guitarist," A good guitarist must be an expert in the fundamentals of guitar playing. The fundamentals include posture when holding the guitar, proper left and right hand finger positioning, and plectrum or pick usage.;
, Though reading guitar tablature is easier, it generally has one drawback: it does not show timing. The beginner should at least be familiar with reading musical notation. Granted, some very talented guitarists are able to play without ever needing tablature or sheet music; they learn a song just by listening to it. But unless you are one of these people, you'll be better-off mastering musical notation so you'll have access to a wide collection of compositions.

, Do drills and exercises to polish your skills and technique. Strengthen your fingers, and aim for a clean and clear tone. Avoid muted sounds unless the music calls for it.

, Learn easy songs first. Not only does this build confidence, but it also helps your fingers 'remember' certain formations and chords that tend to be repeated in other songs.

, Do not get into the habit of not finishing what you start. If a certain part of a song frustrates you, put the guitar down and take a break. You may even sleep on it, and start fresh the next day. Do it at your own pace, it doesn't matter how long you take to master a piece. Of course, remember the previous step. Be reasonable. Do not take on a complicated song or piece if you haven't mastered your basics.

, Do not expect to play like a famous guitar 'god' with just a few lessons. Attaining a professional skill level takes years of practice and training.

, Compare one artist's interpretation of a song to another's. Have an open mind. A good guitarist is familiar with different styles and genres.

, Listen to yourself and identify your mistakes and weaknesses. Have another guitarist critique it. You'll improve more if you know what you must work harder on.

Know your guitar.,
Identify the issue.,
Apply the proper fix.",How to Adjust Your Guitar to Fit You1," Learn where all the good and bad things are such as string buzz or intonation issues. Knowing what could be better on your guitar will make fixing it easier and give you a better feel.

, Figure out what you want to change on your guitar and fix it. Some common issues are fret buzz, this is when you play a note on your guitar and the string vibrates against a fret. In order to do this you need to adjust the bridge first and maybe a twist of the truss rod. Adjusting the action is another common procedure in which the strings need to be raised or lowered to fit the players style and preference which can help fix major buzz.

, To do this, you will need to read the following steps and methods so that you don't break anything and can continue playing.

"
"
Acquire the proper tools.,
Adjust action.,
Check your action.",How to Adjust Your Guitar to Fit You2," If you have a sole work place, gather all materials you need and keep them there. If not, gather all you need for your guitar you will be adjusting and replace them afterwards in an organized place. Here is all the tools you may need for all types of commonly played guitars:


Screwdrivers (+) (-)
Hex wrenches
Pliers
Small Crescent Wrench
String Winder
Side-cutters
Ruler (optional)
Manual (optional);
, For Tune-o-Matics, screwdrivers are all that are needed. Individual saddle bridges and floating tremolos much like Strat style bridges need hex wrenches and screw drivers. Floyd Rose and similar only need hex wrenches. Now that you have the proper tools ready you will adjust the action of your guitar by:


using a hex wrench to adjust each saddle of a Strat style bridge, the bolts are small screws inside the saddle, left is down, right is up. Tune down your strings to make rising easier.
using your fingers or a flathead (-) screwdriver to adjust the bridge and/or tailpiece to obtain desired height.
using a handbook and hex wrenches to adjust the mounting screws on Floyd Rose and similar bridges
Using a manual and proper tools to adjust a bridge not listed

, Once you find a desired height, make sure the strings do not hit anything along the span of the strings, including the frets. A little fret buzz on electrics you can get away with but no fret buzz should be present when you play an acoustic. You may use your ruler to find an exact measurement.

"
"
Be sure.,
Use proper tools.,
Use caution.",How to Adjust Your Guitar to Fit You3," Be certain that the problem requires you to adjust the truss rod before you start. Problems like major buzz, too low or high of and action, or neck warping can be fixed by the truss rod. However, adjusting the truss rod is a very delicate procedure that if rushed or not taken with care can even result in breaking the truss rod or the guitar neck. If at any time you feel uncomfortable adjusting the rod, take your guitar to a tech.

, Use the proper tool for the job most commonly a hex wrench and a manual to describe which way you need to turn.

, If possible, do not do this yourself unless you are experienced, if you're not careful you can easily snap the neck of the guitar, or render it unusable. Take it to a guitar tech where the adjustment is relatively low cost and experienced.

"
"
Know what you need.,
Find a gauge.,
Adjust accordingly.",How to Adjust Your Guitar to Fit You4," Different string gauge and material give you different feel and sound. Research what you need by all means necessary, including playing your guitar. Some examples are; Rock genres- 46-36-26-15-13-10. Metal/down-tune- 54-48-42-24-17-12

, After finding a gauge you like string them onto your guitar and always stretch them. Remember that most guitars will not hold past certain brands of 56 gauge.

, Sometimes a perfect lower gauge action will not be welcomed with a higher gauge string. Adjust your bridge referencing to step 1 to accumulate the best of your guitar.

Set the rhythm of the metronome to 4/4 time.,
Set your metronome's tempo to a comfortable, easy pace to begin -- around 70 beats per minute.,
Evenly strum the guitar to the beat, hitting just one strum per beat.,
Try out a more complicated strumming pattern to keep improving.,
Set the metronome to cut out every other measure, forcing you to stay on time without a guide.,
Try different tempos and time signatures each time you practice.",How to Practice Guitar with a Metronome1," This is the most common time signature in modern music, the one counted out ""1, 2, 3, 4 // 1, 2, 3, 4 // 1, 2..."" The metronome will count out these beats for you, giving you a perfectly timed track to match up with.









Not all metronomes advertise time signatures like ""4/4"" or ""3/4."" Some make you pick the note length. If it asks, set the machine to ""quarter notes."";
, Metronomes determine their speed in beats per minute, or BPM. While many songs are around 100 BPM or more, you need to focus on getting perfect rhythm across a variety of tempos. Start slow, then move up as you get better.









Some people actually find slower tempos harder to match up to, helping you improve even faster. If you can hold at 70 BPM, then 120 will be much easier.

, Just work on one simple strum per beat. This isn't glamorous, but focus on hitting every beat perfectly for 1-2 minutes straight. Really try to get you strumming perfectly matched to the beat.









Once this becomes easier, start upping the speed, still sticking to just one strum per beat.

, Once you can strum every beat, it's time to start playing ""real"" guitar. Pick a couple of chords you are comfortable with -- something simple, like G-C-D -- and start an up-down strumming pattern you can hold comfortably. Up the speed of the metronome, focusing on holding your rhythm even when you have to change chords.








, This is a key feature for practice -- the metronome goes silent for a measure, but comes back in right on time. Your job is to come back on time with it. As you get better and better, keep making the intervals between measures longer and longer. Once you can stay on perfect time even when the metronome cuts out you will have the rhythm mastered.








, Set the machine to eighth notes, or 3/4 time. Get really crazy and try out a song in 7/4, or drop the BPM so low you really need to focus on each well-spaced beat. Metronome practice doesn't have to be boring if you're willing to challenge yourself.









Again, never just screw around or play halfheartedly, making mistakes without corrections. You need to actually work on staying with the metronome to gain anything from these exercises.

"
"
Move your foot or head along with the beat.,
Count yourself in if you struggle to find the beat.,
Focus on the one.,
Play with other musicians, or a jam track, to bridge your skills to real music.",How to Practice Guitar with a Metronome2," This isn't just to look cool -- moving another part of your body along with beat helps you sink into the groove, making it easier to sync your strumming up. Tap a foot or nod you head.








, With the guitar in your hand, simply count with the metronome -- ""1, 2, 3, 4 // 1, 2, 3, 4 // 1, 2..."" Once you feel comfortable with the beat, keep counting as you drop in with the guitar, letting your voice help guide you with the rhythm.









If you're really struggling, adjust the tempo. Don't practice at a pace that forces you to make multiple mistakes -- you want to learn to hold consistent rhythm.

, The first beat of every measure is a good benchmark to hit on time, especially if you're struggling. Counting out the beats, just focus on strumming on the first beat for a few measures. Get use to where the beat ""resets."" When playing with other musicians, the most essential beat to hit in any measure is usually the first one.








, At the end of the day, you're not going to be on stage with a metronome -- you'll be with a percussionist, other guitarist, or no one at all. That said, many recording studios use metronomes, so you do need both skills. Never rely on just one or the other to practice rhythm -- both of them are essential to becoming a top guitarist.

The strings run between the headstock of the guitar, where they are affixed to tuning pegs that can be rotated to tighten and slacken them, and the bridge, where they're fixed to the guitar's body. On an acoustic guitar, the strings are fixed to the bridge with removable pegs, and on an electric guitar the strings are generally strung through an eyelet.
The neck of the guitar is the long wooden piece of wood, flat on one side (this is called the fretboard) and curved on the other. The fretboard is inlaid with metal frets that demarcate the different notes.
An acoustic guitar will have a sound hole in the body where the sound will resonate, while an electric guitar will have as many as three magnetic pickups which will channel the sound through an amplifier.;
, Before you start wailing like Hendrix, make sure you're holding your guitar correctly. If you're right handed, you'll play the guitar by strumming about halfway between the sound hole and the bridge with your right hand and fretting the strings on the neck with your left hand.









To play your guitar, sit up in a straight-backed chair or stool. When you orient the guitar to your body, the smallest string should be pointed toward the ground and the thickest string should be pointed up at the ceiling. Hold the back of the guitar so it touches your stomach and chest and rests on the leg of your strumming/picking hand.
The guitar should be held mostly with your leg and by cradling it in your body. Your left hand is used to stabilize the neck and fret the strings. Hold the neck in the V created by your thumb and forefinger. You should be able to smoothly move your left hand up and down the neck without having to hold it up.
Even if you hold the guitar correctly, you may experience some discomfort while getting used to playing. Do not become discouraged if your shoulder hurts in addition to your neck, arms and hands. You will eventually get used to it.

, It's no fun to play a guitar that's not in tune and can lead to some bad habits when you're first starting out. Tuning regularly will also familiarize you with which string and fret combinations correspond with which notes.










Learn the name of each string. From the lowest to highest pitch (thickest to thinnest strings) the strings are named E, A, D, G, B, and E (after the note played when the string is plucked with no fingers touching it). Use a mnemonic to remember this order, such as ""Eddie Ate Dynamite, Good Bye Eddie!""
Electric tuners are easy to use and very accurate. Hold it to the guitar and pluck the high E. The tuner will tell you if the guitar is ""sharp"" (too high) or ""flat"" (too low). Pick each note and tighten the string to make it go higher, or give it some slack to lower it. Make sure the room is quiet when using a tuner because the microphone on the tuner can pick up other sounds.
If you cannot afford a tuner, you can also tune your guitar without one by matching each note to the corresponding note on the piano.

, The frets are the metal strips that run perpendicular to the strings that mark each note. To play a note, press your finger down between the metal strips, not on them. To say that you're playing the third fret means that you place your finger on the string in the gap between the second and third fret. If you hear buzzing, move your finger away from the lowest fret and closer to the higher fret. Hold the string down firmly so that it only vibrates between your finger and your strumming hand, with the tip of your finger doing the pressing.









Every time you move from one fret to another, the resulting pitch will be half a step higher as you move toward the body and a half step lower as you move toward the headstock. Practice moving up and down the fretboard, pressing the frets and getting a feel for the pressure you need to use to play a note.

, A pick, or plectrum, is a small tear-shaped piece of plastic used for picking out individual notes and strumming the guitar. They're cheap and available at any music retailer. While it's not essential to learn to play guitar with a pick, it's most generally the way to start.


Make a fist with your picking hand and your thumb flat on top of your curled fingers. Hold the pick by grasping it perpendicular to your fist between your thumb and index finger, with no more than a few centimeters of the smaller end sticking out of your hand.

, A chord is a harmonic group of at least three notes. For beginning guitar, there are two basic chord types: first position chords, and barre chords. First position chords can be played with a combination of open strings and pressed strings in the first three frets of the guitar.









Commonly major chords are C Major, A Major, G Major, E Major, D Major.
When you've got the shapes down, practice switching between them as quickly as you can. Write out more or less random arrangements of the chords you want to play and switch between them, strumming once.
Make sure you play the appropriate notes. In A Major, for example, the low E string is not strummed. They'll be marked on the tablature with an ""X"". Develop good habits now for success in the long run.

, The finger placement is as follows (first major, then minor):










C-chord: Place your ring finger on the third fret of the fifth string. Place your middle finger on the second fret of the fourth string, and your index finger on the first fret of the second string. Strum all but the sixth string. Then, go back and play each string individually, while still playing the chord. Make sure each string rings out clearly.

A major: Take your index, middle, and ring finger, and place them on the second frets of the second, third and fourth strings on the guitar. It is simply one line down these three strings. Play every string but the top one.

G chord: Place your middle finger on the third fret of the sixth string. Place your index finger on the second fret of the fifth string, and your ring finger on the third fret of the first string. Make sure each string rings out clearly.

E Major: This is one of the easiest chords there is. Place your middle and ring fingers on the second frets of the fourth and fifth strings. Your index finger should go on the first fret of the third string.

D Major: Place your index finger on the second fret of the third string. Place your middle finger on the second fret of the first string. Place your ring finger on the third fret of the second string. Only play the bottom four strings.

E minor: This is exactly like E major, except you don't use your index finger. Put your middle and ring fingers on the second frets of the second and third thickest strings.

A minor: Place your middle and ring fingers on the second frets of the third and fourth thickest strings, and your index on the first fret of the second thinnest. This is the exact same shape as E major, just moved down one string. Again, ignore the top string.

D minor: Again, very similar to D Major. Place your middle finger on the second fret of the third thinnest string. Place your index finger on the first fret of the thinnest, and your ring finger on the third fret of the second thinnest. Play only the bottom four strings.

, After you had placed all your fingers on the fretboard, play through each of the strings of the chords. Make sure that the strings that are supposed to ring are not muffled or muted.









If the notes are not ringing out properly, chances are that you are not pressing hard enough or parts of your fingers are touching that string which prevents it from sounding out clearly. Are any unused fingers touching strings?
Keep your fretting fingers curled above the fret board when they're touching the strings as if you had your fingers resting over an imaginary glass ball, or a marble in the knuckle of each finger. This leaves space for the open strings to ring out unmuted.

, Strumming consists of downstrokes and upstrokes in various combinations, striking all the notes of the chord evenly and rhythmically. Use your wrist to practice smooth up and down motions. Keep your elbow in tight towards the guitar and sweep the pick down all the strings. Your elbow should not move very much, as you strum mostly from the wrist.








, Barre chords, or movable chords, are extremely useful for starting to play songs. In a barre chord (sometimes shortened to ""bar chord""), the index finger of your fretting hand ""bars"" all the notes at a single fret. To play an F, which is the barre chord in first position, you bar all the notes on the first fret with your index finger and play what is essentially the shape of the E chord moved one step up the neck, with your middle, ring, and pinkie.









Using the same claw-like finger positioning on the second fret, you can play an F# chord. Move to the third fret, and it becomes a G chord. It's a difficult finger positioning to learn, but you can start playing the chords to any rock or pop song relatively quickly when you learn to strum and play barre chords. The Ramones, for example, used nothing but barre chords to great effect.

, There'll be a point at which things will seem bleak: you can't quite get to each chord as fast as you want, your fingers are killing you, and it seems easier to put the thing back in its case. The reason most guitar players stop playing a few weeks in is that it hurts. After a couple of months and years of playing, callouses will build up on the fingers of your fretting hand that will greatly reduce the pain of pushing down the strings for long periods of time. Everyone who learns to play the guitar has to deal with sore fingers at the beginning. Learn to love the pain and associate it with everything that you love about music and the guitar.


Ice your fingers after playing or soak them in some apple cider vinegar to alleviate some of the pain.
Dipping your fingers in rubbing alcohol after playing can speed up callus build up. Just don't do it before you play.

, It's a whole lot more fun to play when you're playing a song that you can recognize and not just a set of chords or notes. Even better, 90% of music is made up of only 3-4 chords. Follow the link in the bolded text to find ten songs you can play with only four chords.









Start off slow and speed up gradually as you get used to the rhythm. It can be frustrating how mechanical you will sound at first, but the more comfortable you get switching between the chords, the closer you'll be to rocking out on stage.
As you master easier songs, move on to more complex pieces. ""Sweet Home Alabama"" by Lynyrd Skynyrd is basically a repetition of D, C, and G in that order, but it sounds much more complex on the record because of the lead guitar licks.

, Guitarists have their own system of music notation called guitar tablature, or guitar tabs for short. The basic idea is to look at each line in the ""staff"" of the tab in the same way you look at your guitar. Each line corresponds to a string, and each number tells you which fret to hold down when plucking that string. For example, to play this tab-notated lick from the Lynyrd Skynyrd song ""Sweet Home Alabama,"" you would play two notes on the open D string, the B string at the third fret, the G string at the second fret, etc.


E|-------------------------------------------------||
B|-------3---------3----------3--------------------||
G|---------2---------0--------0---------------2p0--||
D|-0-0------------------------0--0----0h2p0--------||
A|------------3-3-------------2---0p2-------0------||
E|-----------------------3-3--3--------------------||
Switching between lead-style licks and chords is exciting. You'll feel like you're really making music and not just ""learning guitar."" Make sure you've got your chord shapes down correctly and that you're not losing the rhythm entirely when you play a quick lick.

, The guitar is best learned by watching, listening, and mimicking the techniques of others. You don't have to take formal lessons to learn guitar, but having friends to play with and share tricks and suggestions with can be a great resource.









YouTube tutorials can be extremely helpful for beginners and for advanced players alike. Watching Stevie Ray Vaughn rip through a solo or seeing how Jack Johnson fingers your favorite song can be a great learning experience.
If you'd like to play classical or jazz guitar, or even if you'd like to learn to read sheet music, formal lessons are a good idea. Teaching yourself is a great way of developing your own style, but there is only so much you can learn without a knowledgeable mentor.

Spin the screw to the right to make the bow hair tighter.,
Rosin the bow with the orange, green, or yellow piece of dried pine tree sap.,
Use the rosin and rub it onto the bow hair, up and down repeatedly, about 5 or 6 times.,
Congratulations!",How to Prepare a Violin Bow," A bow is just as fragile as it looks. Take care in handling your violin.;
, Be careful not to make it too tight or loose, see ""Tips"" for a method of checking if the tightness is good.

, If your hands are sweaty, wet, or it is just hard to spin the screw, try putting your shirt, or a piece of cloth over it. The process should be much easier.

, This is called the ""rosin."" Make sure that the surface is rough and grainy so that the grains get into the bow hairs. If it is not, then file it with a nail file or sandpaper.

Learn how to hold it like Geminiani.,
Try some alternate positions, on and above the collarbone.,
Adjust your left hand hold.,
Stabilize your violin with the bow.,
Adjust the angle of your bow arm.,
Learn how to shift.,
Find inspiration.",How to Play the Violin Chin Off," Geminiani said in 1751 that “the violin must be rested just below the collarbone, turning the right-hand side of the violin a little downwards” . Give it a go. If you push the violin against the body, you'll find a quite stable position.;
, Once you have mastered a position below the collarbone, you might also want to try to rest the violin above the collarbone where you can more easily perform music from later time periods. Experiment with banging the violin against the collarbone so that you know exactly where it is. There are two possible positions: 1) more horizontal, directly on the collarbone. 2) more vertical, slightly further up and pushed against the neck, with the button of the violin pointing at the middle of the neck., You can use your thumb quite low, or you can rest the violin in your hand. In any case, you need a flexible and independent thumb that can adjust to the needs of your fingers!

, The bow is part of the chin-off equation! Believe it or not, it actually helps stabilizing the violin. Let’s do this little experiment: Glue the bow against the strings and move the violin in the air with the help of the bow.

, Depending on the angle of your violin, you might have to adjust your bow arm by moving the elbow further back if the violin is more in front of you. You will also have to adjust the level of your arm if your violin is more horizontal/vertical.


, Shifting does become a little bit more adventurous when you play chin-off, but it will also make you get to know your violin better.  There are a few different things to think of when shifting:



 When possible, do half-step shifts and gradual climbing, rather than big jumps.  
Secondly: It is possible to move the whole hand for large upward shifts, but not for large downwards ones (you might end up dropping your violin!). Instead, you can shift downwards like this:  Squeeze the violin a little between 1st finger and thumb. Put on the 2nd and 3rd finger and slide down while keeping the thumb in the same position. When you have reached your destination, rest the violin the hook of your 1st finger while you move your thumb back. Go back to your normal grip.  Voilà! You have now mastered shifting as a chin-off violinist.

Study the violin.,
Tighten the bow by twisting the scroll located just below the frog.,
Put your left thumb and four fingers on the neck at the top of the violin.,
Hold the bow correctly.,
Hold the bow gently but firmly.,
Once you have reached the tip of the bow, put your first finger down.,
It's your decision if you want to mark the spot or not.,
Do the same thing, but this time placing your second finger.,
Place your third finger right beside the second finger.,
Now move to the next string on the left.,
The next string is the D string.,
Do you see a pattern in the strings?,
Good luck!",How to Play a Violin As a Beginner," Pluck the strings at the fingerboard. The highest note is E. The lowest is G. The second lowest is D and the second highest is A.
,


Put rosin on it. Make sure to scratch newly bought rosin with sandpaper, a key, or a coin so it's no longer smooth. You will need to rosin your bow about every time you practice. After practicing, make sure to wipe your violin with a clean cloth to get rid of any sticking rosin.







, Make sure your wrist is straight, not flat. Remember, ""no pancake hands! Make your wrist straight as a carrot!"" Flex your fingers and touch the strings. Put the chin rest under your jaw and align the violin with your arm. Don't put the violin right on your arm, a bit beside it.

, Put your thumb just next to the frog. Place your middle and ring finger together on the frog. Make sure they don't go around the frog. Your pointing finger should rest on its side at the second knuckle about four centimeters above your middle finger. Lastly, place your pinky finger next to the scroll. Always remember that your pinky should not go around the bow; it's the only finger that stays on top.

It might also be beneficial to place your fingers near the balance point of the bow. To do this, lay out your middle finger (since it has the most balance) and place the bow on it. Move the bow to the right or left until it stays on your finger without falling off. Then put all of your fingers in place - your finger positioning stays the same, you are just placing your hand in a different place.







, Be sure that your bow stick is parallel to the bridge. Start with E, the string closest to your right. E is the highest string. Rest the bow on the E string and start at the bottom of the bow. Put the hair on the string and slowly pull the bow down. Flex from your elbow.


Remember not to put pressure on your hand; use the weight of your arm to pull the bow.

, The key is to know where to put your fingers. Put your finger right at the edge of the fingerboard. It's an F. Move it down one fingertip. That should be where you put your first finger.

, Many violin teachers mark the spot so that you always know where to put your finger, although you will get into the habit of looking at your fingers and not relying on your ears.

, Start right beside your first finger and move it down one finger tape. Mark this with tape as well. This note is a G. Play.

, Move it down only half a fingertip. Mark this as well. It is an A. Play this note.

, It is the second highest. It is called the A string. Play this. Now. You should already have the tape marking where all the notes are. No fingers is A. First finger is B. Second finger is C. Third finger is D.

, Open string: D. First finger: E. Second Finger: F. Third Finger: G.

, Guess the next note. If you guessed G, then you're right. The notes on the G string in ascending order are: G, A, B and C.

, Keep practicing and use the help of a teacher."

Finish with a bow.",How to Play Air Guitar," It's recommended that you try metal/rock or punk, as these tend to have the right pace, energy and rhythm needed for good air guitar playing. Most air guitar players are simulating electric guitar music like rock and heavy metal. On the whole, most other music genres are a lot harder to play air guitar to, some being too slow, some too melancholy and some just plain too complicated.;
, A guitar solo section is always the best place to play air guitar. The longer this section, the better, giving you a great chance to really get involved in the playing. Be sure to include some riffs.

, Try to imagine that you are creating the sounds that you're hearing. Part of imitating is believing, visualizing yourself up there on stage being the center of attention as the crowd hollers for more, more, more!


When you play the music for the air guitar session, the music must be as loud as you (and those around you) can withstand. It's best that way!

, Spread your legs out wide, bend your knees a bit and put your right hand about level with your crotch. Hold the guitar in place––bend both arms between 75 and 90 degrees, one hand in front of your belt buckle. Your palm should face you at the appropriate fret spot that a real guitar player would play frets and have the other hand up in the air with the fingers spread, bent and pointing toward you.

, When playing, here are some things to bear in mind:


The higher the note, the lower your hand should be placed.
Don't put your strumming hand down too low, no real guitar player will play with the guitar down to their knees, except Fieldy from Korn.
Occasionally caress the imaginary neck of your guitar, running your hand up and down it.
Get moving! This isn't just about shifting your fingers and arms around. Get the whole body involved. Bend those knees, lift those legs, jump up and down now and then. Jerky movements and slides across the ""stage"" are great additions too.

If you want to be really cool, try some Jimi Hendrix style moves with your air guitar; behind your head, playing with teeth, doing spins and moves like that. You could even smash it up at the end don't worry it'll fix itself.



, While performing your exaggerated strumming motion, accompany this with loud singing or lip-syncing. This step is optional; you don't have to be a singing guitar player and you might not find a suitable combination of music with energetic singing. However, if you do love the lyrics, this can really help get you into the spirit.


Loud ""yeahs"" are considered mandatory by some air guitar players, so even if you can't sing, you can holler!

, It's fun alone and twice the fun with someone else. Get an air buddy willing to jam with you. Maybe they can join in on bass? You will look much less ridiculous and others might even join in. In fact, the more the merrier. Let it rock!

, Your audience will applaud.

",How to Play Some Simple Tunes on the Violin," Test this by holding your chin on the chin rest. The chin rest is the black piece towards the bottom of the fingerboard. Most newer violins have one, but some people take them off or an older violin may simply not have one. Getting one attached is a simple matter of going to a music store or a violin instructor. Then, grab the scroll. The scroll is the elegantly carved piece at the very end of the fingerboard.


Once you are holding it, if your arm is stretched out but you aren't straining to reach it, that's your size. The sizes are Full, Three-Quarter, Half, and Quarter. Keep in mind, however, if you're between 9 and 18, you may want to buy a Full size one. That way when you're finished growing for a while you won't need a new one right away, it's pretty easy to play one a size big. If you're a little kid and you need a Quarter, a Half will most likely accommodate your size for a little bit longer.





;
, It goes as follows. The body is the basic wooden structure. The fingerboard is the long, often black, piece containing most of the strings. The scroll is the end piece, which contains the peg box, where the strings are attached to the violin. F-holes are the black scrolling openings on either side. These allow the vibrations to escape from the sound post, the part that is responsible for turning vibrations into music. The bridge is where the strings run over on their way down. This is connected to the internal sound post, causing the vibrating strings to make the whole violin come to life and make music appreciated worldwide.

, Many books designed for children are good no matter your age; the notes are often labeled.

, Hold it by the curve in the middle so you are looking down the whole structure towards the scroll. Facing this way, the string to the far left, the thickest, is G. The next one to the right of G is D. The next one after that is A, then E.

, The bow, made of wood and horsehair pulled from the tail of a horse (no animals harmed, that's not painful and the horse can grow the hairs back), is drawn across the strings to create a vibration, carried through the bridge and down the sound post. You may wonder, with only four strings, how can such a wide range of notes be produced? The player placing their fingers down, that's how!

,, Reverse these directions for lefties.

, The middle strings are easier to switch between at first. Then you can move on to E string. Try G when you're comfortable.

, These are easy to learn, only too difficult to explain. If you bought a good book though, you'll be confident in what it says. If the book makes you feel like you're doing something wrong, pop in the CD/DVD that came with it. If you're still not sure, go buy a new book, but keep the other one. Even if they're poor in basic instructions, they'll have some good practice songs for later.

Identify the e-string and g-string side.,
Loosen the strings slightly.,
Place the bridge between the F-holes.,
Put the violin strings in the knobs of the bridge.,
Tighten the strings.",How to Place a Bridge on a Violin1," A violin bridge is a small piece of wood. The bottom of the bridge is usually a straight line, while the top is arched slightly. When you're examining your bridge, you'll notice one side of the arch is slightly higher than the other. The lower side is the e-string side, and the taller side is the g-string side. When you put the bridge in place, make sure the e-string comes over the e-string side, and the g-string comes over the g-string side.If you don't know which strings are which, when the violin's head is facing your body, the g-string will be the string farthest to the left. The e-string will be the string farthest to the right.;
, To avoid snapping a string while placing the bridge, loosen the strings slightly. You loosen violin strings by turning the tuning knobs on the end of the violin. Strings should be loose enough that you can easily pull them up and down, allowing them to be lifted up enough to slip the bridge under the strings., The F-holes are two f-shaped holes found near the end of the violin's head. When you slide the bridge under the strings, make sure it's between the two F-holes. The bridge should be placed at roughly the midway point of the f-holes. Imagine you're drawing a line from one f-hole to the next, starting at the small horizontal line running through one f-hole and stretching out to meet the small horizontal line running through the other f-hole. This imaginary line should run through the violin bridge., The violin bridge has four small knobs running across the top. The four violin strings fit into these knobs, keeping the bridge and the strings in place. Gently feed one violin string at a time into the knobs on the bridge., Now you can retighten your strings to keep the knob in place. Gently turn each knob on the bottom of the violin. It's a good idea to use one hand to hold the bridge in place while tightening the strings, to prevent it from falling over. Tighten the strings until they are secure enough to keep the bridge in place while still having a very slight amount of slack."
"
Make sure the bridge is standing at a 90 degree angle.,
Check to make sure the bridge is in the center of the violin.,
Make sure the bridge falls roughly in the middle of the f-holes.",How to Place a Bridge on a Violin2," Once you've placed your bridge, you'll want to check to make sure its placement is correct. Lay your violin down on a flat surface. Get down to the violin's level. The side of the bridge facing the violin's tailpiece should stand at a roughly 90 degree. The other side of the bridge should be sloped forward slightly.If the bridge is not forming a 90 degree angle, you may have put it in place backwards. You'll have to remove the bridge and start over.

, Your bridge should be in the center of the violin. It should not be too far to the left or right. If your bridge is leaning to the right or the left, gently push it until it's in the center of the violin.You can simply eyeball to see if the bridge is in the center by glancing at the violin from a bird's eye angle. If you want to be extra sure the bridge is positioned correctly, however, you can use a ruler or measuring tape to measure the length of each end of the bridge to the end of the violin. The measurements should be roughly equal.

, The bridge should be between the f-holes, roughly falling between the middle of each hole. The bridge may have slipped slightly while you were tightening the strings, so once again check. Make sure you can drawn an imaginary line through the center of each f-hole that runs through the bridge. If the bridge has moved, gently slide it up or down until it's in the right place."
"
Hold the bridge when tuning.,
Replace strings individually.,
It is best to have a professional place your bridge.",How to Place a Bridge on a Violin3," Bridges often fall out of place during tuning. To prevent this from happening, make sure you hold your bridge in place with one hand when tuning.

, On occasion, you will need to replace the strings of your violin as they break and wear down over time. In this case, make sure to replace strings individually. Removing more than one string at once can cause the bridge to fall out of place., Take your violin back to the shop where you bought it, or bring it to a music shop. If you don't feel confident placing a bridge on your own, ask your instructor to do so, or get a professional do so for you despite the cost. A professional will sand it, make sure it's the right size for your instrument and will adjust the sound post. "

Approach violin practice in a different way.,
Split sessions up.,
Check with your teacher about your pieces.,
Use movement to express musicality.,
If you prefer a particular genre of music, you can play that genre you prefer.,
Listen to violin music while doing other tasks.,
Picture your violin as your best friend or twin.,

Know about celebrity musicians.,
Take advice from your tutor or music teacher.",How to Make Violin Practice Fun," If you look at violin practice as 'a chore' or 'boring' - chances are it will be a boring old chore. Instead, stop and think... why do you like the violin? Go through all the main reasons why you like it. Many like the violin because of its sound, so instead you could say something like ""My violin is a cool instrument - I love its sound, so I will practise to make it sound even better!"" Say it enough times, then it will become fun.;
, Your natural attention span only lasts 30-45 minutes. If you're an advanced player and you must practice for an hour or more per day, do half an hour in the morning and another half hour at night. You're doing the same amount of practice, but in small chunks.

, You may have been playing them for a while now, and have become too easy. Or it could be too hard. Ask your teacher for permission if you may learn some new pieces or scales.

, Sometimes, it pays to be a little bit crazy. Close your eyes and sway with the music like Joshua Bell. Mairead Nesbitt (the fiddler) from the Irish group Celtic Woman can play the violin while jumping and twirling around on stage. You could even choreograph a dance routine with your violin, like YouTube violinist Jun Sung Ahn (JunCurryAhn). If you choose this, find yourself a private studio, music room or a space in the house where you are free to move around.

, You can play pop music on your violin, for example. Alternatively, if you prefer learning violin by ear, listen to a particular song multiple and then teach yourself to play it with no sheet music.

, The more music you're exposed to, the better.

, You are pretty much inseparable. In your head, you can start up a little conversation with it, and let its sound 'talk' to you. Listen to whatever it has to say. Pretend only you and your violin can understand a secret language, like you would with your best friend. If you leave your instrument in its case for too long, you can say it will start to get lonely and neglected.

, Think about your memories with your violin. Were they happy memories? You have come a long way since when you were child. And your violin has come a long way since being popularized during the 13-14th Centuries. Question its past. Was it really one of the first instruments to appear in the Venetian Court? Just imagine all the stories your instrument could tell...

, Use your imagination to make up a story in the back of your mind as you practise. Here are a few suggestions:


You're a celebrity violinist and you're backstage preparing for a huge show. If you let yourself be lazy, you're going to get booed off by the crowds.






You have applied to audition for a prestigious violin scholarship, and you have to do a performance exam. The panel is testing you on how well you know your scales, your pieces, theory, your musicality and how well you can read sheet music. In order to get that scholarship, you need to practise harder and more efficiently to be just that little bit better than everyone else.






Imagine you are a child prodigy. You have to perform in front of some important people. Therefore, you must practise hard in order to impress them.






You're going to record your latest album. You want the CD to sound good enough to impress the untrained ear and the only way you can do that is practicing a number of times to avoid any 'recording' mistakes.
Imagine a special someone in your room as you practice. They are sitting in the corner, beside you. It could be your crush or significant other, a best friend, favourite family member, or someone in your life that you respect. No matter who they are, if they are a person worth impressing you must practice if you want to look good in front of them.

, Practise for a certain amount of time and reward yourself afterwards with things like a day with friends, movies, new stationery, books, clothes. Chocolates also work - but only do the chocolate reward sparingly. Avoid money rewards, these can become unappealing after you've spent some of it.

, Keep posters of them, get their latest albums and if possible watch their DVDs. This can be handy when you have a bad day, as having a picture of them or listening to their music can help inspire you. Some include Andre Rieu, Lindsey Stirling, Hilary Hahn, Sarah Chang, Midori, Celtic Woman's Mairead Nesbitt,and Itzhak Perlman.

, They often have the best practising tips.

"
"
Open your violin case up and put it in a sunny place.,
Leave your violin in an open, sunny area for a period of time (closing it at night of course) storing the bow in a safe area outside the case where the hair can breathe.

,
Vacuum out your case a number of times thoroughly.,
Have your bow repaired, or purchase a new bow if your old one has become a victim of the bow bugs.

,
Putting 15 drops of rosemary or cedar essential oil may also repel these bugs.,
Practice, practice, practice!",How to Get Rid of Bow Bugs," These bugs hate light and open, fresh areas..;
,, Do this at least two times. It may take a few times to clean out the bugs.

,, Placing chips of cedar wood or a cake of camphor (wrapped in cloth) in the case can also work, but these steps are optional. Moth balls also may help, but often contain poisons or neurotoxins. A better choice might be ""Sawyer's Permethrin"" or ""Repel Permanone"" pest repellent. Remove all items, spray everywhere, especially in bow pockets, and let dry before returning bow and violin to case.

, Bow bugs like places that are dark, concealed and unopened for long periods of time.

"
Violin and Viola players should turn their instruments over and carefully place them in their laps with the peg box to the left.,
Cello and Bass players should turn their instruments back side out and carefully place them in a stand, or have someone carefully support the instrument.

,
Measure length-wise across the back of the instrument (4) from the purfling (3) in the neck button area (1) to the purfling edge by the end button (2).,
Refer to the following list of body sizes by measurement to find your instruments body size.","How to Measure the Body Size of a Violin, Fiddle, Viola, Cello or Upright Bass",";

Learn to play the violin.,
Learn to read music.,
Look for songs to play.,
Have fun!

",How to Play Songs on the Violin," This is absolutely essential. You can't just pick up a violin and play it straight away, it takes a substantial amount of time to learn and you will likely need several years experience before you can tackle complicated songs.;
, You can learn songs by ear but it's better if you can read the actual notes.Note: Only treble clef is used in violin music.

, Buy books of sheet music in music shops (make sure it's for violin though), or try the internet. Also try learning by ear.


If you're a beginner, try nursery rhymes. (You'll probably do this if you have proper lessons anyway.)






Although they aren't really songs as such, you can learn a lot from playing classical music. (Again, the kind of things you'll likely do in lessons, if you have them.)






Country music would be a good idea to play as violins are often used.






Same goes for pop; you will often hear some violins in amongst the guitar, bass and synthesizers.






You could try rock and metal, but usually these kind of genres' music focuses much more on guitars. However, if you really want to play rock/metal songs on violin and have had a good few years experience, consider learning a bit about guitars and guitar tabs; this will open the door to a world of online tabs which you should be able to adapt for violin with some knowledge and skill.

Learn the names and placement of the distinctive elements of the violin.,
Note what the F-holes do.,
Find the fingerboard.,
Locate the chin rest.,
Understand the purpose of the strings on the violin.,
Know the terminology applied to parts of the violin directly related to the strings:

The bridge is a wooden piece that holds up the strings and carry the vibration of the strings to the body.,
Know how to locate the tuning pegs.,
Have a good understanding of the bow and its parts.",How to Identify the Parts of a Violin," The body is the large wooden part of the violin. It vibrates with the strings to make more sound.;
,


The neck is the skinny part of the violin between the main body and the nut. This is where the violinist's left hand is placed while playing.






The tailpiece is near the bridge. It houses the fine tuners at the end of each string.






The scroll is the decoratively carved end of the neck of the violin. It is usually shaped like a rolled-up spiral (hence the name). However, some scrolls are carved into the form of a human or animal head.







, You need to know these so that you can understand what is being asked of you when you're asked to clean, place fingers on, tighten, etc. various parts of the violin. Every beginner violinist must know these names by heart and what they signify.

, The f-holes are f shaped holes in the body. These holes are put in place to help amplify the sound and project the acoustics of the violin more.

, The fingerboard is the long wooden piece touching the peg box. This is where the violinist places his or her fingers to shorten the vibrating section of the strings. If the finger is placed nearer to the bridge, the pitch will be higher. If the finger is placed nearer to the scroll, the pitch will be lower.

, True to it's name, is where the violinist places his or her chin or jaw. this is attached to the bottom of the body.

, The strings are where the magic happen. They are usually made out of metal or animal gut. When the violinist uses the bow on the strings or plucks the strings, they vibrate and create the beautiful tones of the violin. Violin strings change in pitch when the tension is changed or a violinist's finger presses on them. The strings from left to right are called: G, D, A, then E (E being the highest in pitch).

,






The fine tuners are metal screws that change the tension in the strings by small amounts for fine adjustments.







, There are four tuning pegs near the scroll. These are used to hold the strings in the peg box with friction. They are used to adjust the tension (which changes the pitch) on the four corresponding strings. There are some violins in existence that have mechanical geared pegs, however they are rare and not very popular. Conventionally, the lower left peg holds the G string, the upper left peg holds the D string, the upper right peg holds the A string and the lower right peg holds the E string.

Also note the peg box. The peg box is at the end of the finger board. This is where the four strings are wound around the tuning pegs.






The nut is located at the top of the fingerboard near the peg box. The nut helps hold the strings in place over the fingerboard. The nut is sometimes used instead of a finger to limit the vibrating area of the string. Doing so makes a harsher tone than when stopped with a finger.







, The bow is used to make sound on the strings. It has a few parts to it as well:


The stick is the wooden part of the bow which is above the hair.






The hair is the part that interacts with the string.






The part of the hair that is closest to the hand is called the frog.






The part of the hair that is furthest from the hand is called the tip.

Make sure that you have all the appropriate supplies for your practice time.,
Set goals for how much you want to practice for each category of music.,
Always start your practice time with scales.,
Next move into etudes.,
After that, move onto your solo, or other current music.,
Metronomes are friends!!",How to Make the Most of Practice Time for Violin," This should include a stand, your violin and bow, music, pencil, and a metronome.;
, Write it down in a notebook, and keep a clock close by to monitor the time. For example: scales: 10 minutes, etudes: 20 minutes, solo: 20 minutes, etc. You may want to set a timer if it helps you remember.

, This will warm up your fingers and make you more aware of the key of pieces. Start at G and play as many octaves as you can. Then go up chromatically, as far as you know. Go slowly, and precisely; making sure each note is in tune. This may also be used as a warm-down.

, Be well aware of the key and don't worry so much about the bowings, unless your teacher wants you to have them. Make sure the notes are in tune: that is etude's main purpose. Play the etudes straight through, and then pinpoint any difficult spots.

, Make sure you don't just keep playing this straight through. Avoid playing the parts you know over and over, and work on the difficult parts. If there is a hard passage take it out of the music and practice is slowly with nice, sustained bows. Increase the speed from there until you have is up to speed, and put it back into context.

, Try to use one at least every other day, especially in parts where you are rushing. When you get a new piece, play it slowly with the metronome, to make sure you get every note with every melody.

Sit down in a straight-backed chair or stand up straight.,
Don’t slouch.,
Position your feet.",How to Hold a Violin1," It doesn’t matter if you choose to sit or stand, but it does matter that you keep your core engaged and that you sit up or stand up straight. You want to feel like you have power up through your body.;
, Slouching can lead to decreased speed and eventual pain. When sitting, both feet should be flat on the ground with the same positioning as if you were standing.

, If you're standing, position your feet a comfortable distance apart. They should be slightly less than shoulder-width apart, with your left foot a bit in front of the right. Place your weight fairly evenly between your two feet. When moving while playing, you may shift the weight between your feet. "
"
Place the violin on your neck and shoulder.,
Place your chin on the chinrest.,
Angle your head properly.,
Pivot the violin toward the center.",How to Hold a Violin2," You should rest the broad end of the violin onto your left collarbone with the neck of the violin facing outward. It should feel like a relatively natural, stable position.

, Lower you head straight down until it touches the chin rest. This may feel slightly less natural, but you also shouldn’t be straining yourself too dramatically. Your chin should only drop, not stretch.

, Now that your chin is on the chinrest, angle your head a little to the left so that you are looking 90 degrees from your violin. You want to angle your head in such a way that the chin rest runs along your jaw and ends at your chin.

, It should create a line that extends from your nose outward. This is the correct way to hold a violin. If this is your first time holding a violin it might seem difficult, but get in the habit of doing it this way. Otherwise you will develop bad habits that will make it difficult to progress in the future.

"
"
Keep the angle of the violin relatively steady while playing.,
Hold the violin straight with the strings parallel to the ground.,
Position your left hand at the end of the violin's neck, before the struts.,
Curl your forefinger onto the top of the neck.,
Establish a straight line from your left wrist to your forearm.,
Grasp the bow.",How to Hold a Violin3," When you play, the angle of the violin will fluctuate from left to right depending on the type of music and your comfort level. However, the angle should not deviate too much more than 20 degrees. , The violin has a tendency to drop with bad posture, so check your posture if you notice the violin dropping constantly. To help with this, tie a rope from the ceiling and attach it to the scroll of the violin. Make sure that the rope is short enough that it is taut when the violin is in the proper position. , Hold the neck between your left thumb and forefinger, as if you are pinching it. You don’t need to hold it too tightly or you will cramp your hand.

, The remaining fingers should not touch the violin. The violin should rest on that knuckle lightly. The weight of the violin should be distributed evenly between this knuckle and your collarbone. , Do not twist your wrist. This positioning will change depending on the type of music being played and which strings you are using. This is the basic 1st position.

, You need to hold the bow at the end of the bow. Don’t choke up on it like a baseball bat. Hold it with your right thumb and fingers. Your forefinger should rest on top of the bow's pad and your pinky finger should sit on a screw. Now you are ready to play. "
"
Begin practicing vibrato only after you are fairly comfortable with your finger placement and have memorized all of your notes' positions.,
Understand how your wrist is supposed to move as you vibrato.,
As you hold your left hand in this fashion, imagine that someone is holding a pencil just centimeters away from the side of your hand.,
Try it with your instrument.,
Keep in mind that your finger should never slide on the string.,
Try bowing the string that your vibrating finger is on.,
Move very slowly when learning, to develop muscle memory.,
Practice this slowly until you feel very comfortable.",How to Do Vibrato on a Violin1,";
, Hold your left hand in the air as if you are ready to play the instrument.

, Try to move your wrist and your arm so that your hand touches the imaginary pencil. Keep in mind that, while you vibrate, the only thing you should be trying to move is your wrist (in a back and forth motion), as if there were two pencils on either side and you were trying to brush them as your hand moves. This is the movement you shall use for vibrato. While doing this movement, your left hand should remain extremely calm.

, First you should try the vibrato movement without actually playing, and you should attempt to do it slowly. Vibrato works best when only one finger is on the string. You may try vibrato with any finger you would like, although it is usually easier to do on the 2nd and 3rd fingers. Do not attempt vibrato on the 4th finger until you have mastered it on the rest of the fingers, however.

, It rolls against the fingerboard, rather than slipping back and forth. Again, keep in mind that your wrist should be moving, and not your arm. You should also not have to put effort into rolling your finger against the string. Because your wrist is in the vibrato motion, your finger should roll on its own.

, You will hear the pitch lowering. That is because, as you vibrate, your finger should first be on the correct pitch, and then roll towards the scroll, which will lower the pitch. After that, your finger should roll back towards the previous pitch. This is what causes the shaky sound in vibrato.

, Your finger should roll against the string so slowly that you can hear the lowering of pitch. And then, after that, the raising of pitch.

, Learning vibrato may take a lot of time, but it is very much worth it.

"
"
If doing vibrato with your wrist is giving you troubles, try doing it with your forearm, instead.,
To do vibrato with the arm, start with the first step with learning wrist vibrato, but instead of just moving your wrist move your full forearm back and forth.

,
After that becomes fairly comfortable get your violin and put a finger on the fingerboard and very slowly move your arm back and forth with your finger still on the fingerboard.

,
Be sure to switch your fingers too, it is important to be comfortable doing vibrato with all your fingers.

,
When you get more comfortable, speed up the vibrato bit by bit.

",How to Do Vibrato on a Violin2," This way is much easier to learn and it gives a richer sound than vibrato with the wrist.

Form a ring with your thumb and fingers.,
Place the bow into your curved hand.,
Let the remaining fingers fall into place.,
Allow for differences in the down stroke and upstroke.The position described here is the basic position you will use when making both a down stroke and an upstroke.,
Avoid overextending and tensing your joints.",How to Hold a Bow1," Hold the bow in a vertical position using your non-dominant hand. With your dominant hand, form a loose ring with your thumb and both the middle and ring fingers.


Note that your index and pinky fingers should naturally curve down toward your thumb, as well. Do not touch your thumb with those fingers, but keep them relaxed and perched in that curved position.;
, With the bow hair facing you, gently open the ring you created so that you can slide the stick of the bow inside.


The stick should rest on your thumb right at the point where the frog (the device where the bow hair is held and can be adjusted) meets the leather bow grip.

, Bring the index and ring fingers down over the opposite side of the frog. The pads of those fingers should rest directly on the frog.


Your index finger should rest around the stick at a finger's space away from the middle finger, and the pinky should curve and rest on top of the bow stick.
You should gently hold the bow without gripping it. Your fingers should be curved in a natural, relaxed form, and your joints should not be stiff. Your palm should also remain soft.

, But you should be relaxed and accept gradual changes in this position as you move your bow along the instrument.


In general, your fingers will be more arched during a down stroke, but during an upstroke your fingers will become more elongated.

, While playing, be sure that you keep your hands and joints free from tension. It should be a comfortable and relaxed grip.

Your first and second finger joints should all be bent slightly, with no hyperextensions. Otherwise you will not have a lot of control and your strokes will be short.

Keep your wrist relaxed.",How to Hold a Bow2," The thumb of your dominant hand needs to rest on the point of contact between the bow and the frog, which is the device at the end of the bow hairs where they can be tightened. Your thumb will end up being wedged between the bow hairs and the bow stick, somewhere between the frog itself and the leather pad next to it.


The bow should be in a horizontal position. Hold it straight across with your non-dominant hand placed at the middle or the far end as you position your dominant hand correctly. Release the bow from your non-dominant hand once you set your bow hold.
Note that the portion of the bow used for playing will face toward your non-dominant side. For right-handed cellists, this will be the left; for left-handed cellists, this will be the right.

,


If you are left-handed and holding the bow with a dominant left hand, turn the wrist slightly to the right.

, The remaining fingers should curve gently over the top of the bow stick. The pinky finger should not be allowed to rest on top of the bow stick, as it might with a bow stick for a viola or violin. Instead, the pinky should also extend downward with the other three fingers.


While it is not essential, the middle finger usually lies just opposed to the thumb from the opposite side of the stick. The ring finger is usually on the side of the frog, and the first joint of your pointer finger will usually end up on the leather pad or metal winding ahead of the frog.Even though the exact placement of your fingers can vary, you should not allow your thumb to collapse back as you play. It needs to remain gently bent in a normal direction.
Most of your leverage will come from your thumb, pinky, and ring finger as you play.

, Do not press the bow to the strings of the cello. Lightly lay the bow on the strings as you hold it and as you play.Ultimately, as you play, you need to have a loose, relaxed grip that is just firm enough to control the direction of the bow.

"
"
Hold the bow downward.Keep the bow facing vertically downward with the frog pointed up.,
Turn the bow until it touches your index finger.,
Let your remaining fingers fall into place.,
Maintain your hold while playing.",How to Hold a Bow3," Rest your hand on top in an open ""handshake"" position, with your palm resting lightly on top of the frog.


The ""frog"" refers to the enclosed mechanism that holds and tightens the bow hair.
A ""handshake"" position simply refers to the sort of position you would hold your hand in if you were preparing to shake hands with someone.
Note that this method is one of the most common ways to hold a German bow, but it is not the only way. If you want to explore different techniques, talk it over with a bass teacher or with a more experienced bassist.

, Gradually turn the bow sideways, drawing the frog further into the palm of your hand and pointing the bow inward toward your body.


The tip of your bent thumb should just barely touch the tip of your index finger, and both should rest lightly on top of the bow.
Do not pinch the bow in between your thumb and index finger. They should only rest on top of the bow and should not grab onto it directly.

, Position your middle finger so that it rests directly next to the index finger. The ring finger should rest next to the middle finger, and the pinky should rest beneath the frog.


Your pinky should touch the outer part of the ferrule, the silver part of your bow.
Essentially, the bow will be cupped gently inside of your hand and held in a horizontal position as you play.

, Keep your hands relaxed and flexible to allow for movement, but not a loss of control, as you play. The wrist should bend slightly as you play downward in order to keep the bow straight across the strings.

Similarly, the fingers will straighten a bit as you play, but be sure they do not hyperextend, which will reduce your control and make your transitions difficult on the backstroke.

"
"
Relax your hand over the bow.,
Allow your fingers to fall into place.,
Try another hold if this one is not comfortable.,
Keep your hand in place as you play.",How to Hold a Bow4," Hold the middle of the bow with your non-dominant hand. Rest your dominant hand over the bow, just above the frog. Keep the fingers of your dominant hand relaxed and naturally spread apart.


The bow should be in a horizontal position.

, Bend the thumb slightly so that the tip touches the point at which the frog meets the rest of the bow, or the ""contact point."" Your other fingers should gently curve over the top of the bow stick and down the side.


Do not allow the pinky finger to rest on top of the bow stick. This position might be comfortable to you if you have ever played the violin or viola, but your hand will not have enough support if you repeat it with the French bow. Instead, the pink should curve and extend over the top of the bow stick with the rest of the fingers.
Release the bow from your non-dominant hand once you have a good grasp with your dominant hand.
You can let your fingers extend past the bow, or you can keep them perched higher up. The choice is yours. Experiment to determine what placement feels most natural and gives you the most control.

, While the method just described is the most common holding technique used for a French bow, there are variations you can use if holding the bow in this way feels awkward or uncomfortable for you.

Try imitating the placement of teachers, mentors, or favorite performers to try slight variations on the French hold, such as placing the pinky finger in the ""U"" of the frog.Playing a bass is very personal, but it takes practice to find your ideal holding position.
The length of your fingers and size of your hands will likely determine how ""relaxed"" your hold is, or how your spread apart your fingers tend to be on the bow. Try bringing your fingers closer or farther apart along the length of the frog.
One good rule of thumb, regardless of your hand size, is to place your fingers a natural distance apart. You can locate this natural distance by allowing your hands to fall at your sides, naturally curving at the fingers and thumbs. The distance between your fingers in this natural relaxed posture should be the same when you grip the bow.

, The initial grip is much easier than maintaining that grip through heavy playing. It is important to exercise your hands with daily playing so that you will have the stamina to hold your grip through several songs.

Do not overstrain any particular fingers. Try to keep the tension between all of your fingers and thumb. Do not allow your pinky or thumb to straighten.

If you can, check the musical clefs.",How to Distinguish Between Violins and Violas," Is it big or small? The violin generally has a smaller frame than the viola.;
, The bow is the long wooden stick that is used to play an instrument. If the end which you hold the bow (the frog) is a straight 90 degree angle it is a violin bow, whereas the viola bow is a 90 degree angle with a curved corner. Moreover, the viola usually has a heavier bow.

, Is it lower or higher? The violin has a higher e-string while the viola has a lower c-string.

, The violin string order from lowest to highest is: G, D, A, E. Violas do not have an E string, but an additional lower note, making their string order from lowest to highest: C, G, D, A.

, Violins generally play higher pitched parts of the music while Violas play lower pitched parts. However both instruments use much of the same techniques in playing and require the same level of training and dedication to master.

,

If it is a solo, check the printed program to identify the instrument being played.
If it is an orchestra, the strings nearer to you (the audience) on the left are the violins. The first instruments to the left of the conductor are the ""first"" violins. The next section is the ""second violins"". The next section usually contains the violas, but occasionally the violas might be placed directly opposite of the first violins.

, Violins read treble clef while violas read mainly alto clef (and occasionally treble clef).

After you're done playing, loosen the bow and wipe of the stick with a soft, lint-free cloth.,
Sometimes, just a simple wipe down isn't enough.,
Take a small amount of denatured alcohol and, using a soft toothbrush, gently brush the hair lengthwise.,
Hang the bow to dry in such a way that the hair is not touching the stick.

,
Put the bow back together, tighten the strings, and rosin well.

",How to Clean a Violin Bow," Loosening the bow helps prevent warping while it's in the case.;
, Occasionally, you will need to clean the hair of your bow. To do this, loosen the screw on the end of the frog and take the bow hair away from the stick.

",How to Change the Strings on a Violin or Fiddle," Loosen it by twisting its tuning peg in the appropriate direction, and pull the string out of the hole in the tuning peg. Then unhook the other end from the fine tuner. If there is no fine tuner, unhook it from its hole in the tailpiece. Only take one string off at a time because if you don't then your bridge, tail piece, and sound post can fall off.;
, Insert the ball-less end of the string into the hole in the tuning peg, and push it all the way through, so that about 2 centimeter (0.8 in) of it sticks out the other side. Bend this end back so that the string does not come out of the hole easily. Place the ball end of the string into its fine tuner or the hole in the tailpiece.

, Tighten it until it is approximately at the pitch it should be.

, It is best to wait a day before changing the next string.

, Since you will be tightening the new strings a lot with the tuning pegs, your bridge will start to lean toward the fingerboard. Just straighten it out by gently pulling the top toward the tailpiece.

,, After you have tuned your new strings, stretch them back and forth rapidly and vigorously (be careful when stretching them if they are not dominant strings). Then, tune them again. You should notice that they have gone flat. This is because they have stretched. Repeat this process until they will not stretch anymore. This will make your instrument stay in tune much better.

Practice.",How to Teach Yourself to Play the Piano1," If you don’t have one at home, perhaps you can borrow one from a friend. The benefit of learning to play on a piano is that the sound is authentic because it’s generated by a string. It also contains all 88 keys. Keyboards don’t have either of these features. Keep that in mind when making your selection.


Pianos are much more expensive than keyboards, but they can be rented to own at some piano stores.
Tune the piano if it is an antique or vintage piano so that you can train your ear to hear the notes correctly. Older pianos are usually out of tune especially if they are not played regularly. If your piano hasn't been played for ages, you may want to have it tuned professionally before going any further.
If you're unable to find a piano, a keyboard is a great alternative. They're affordable, never go out of tune and have lots of sounds and features that can enhance your music. Not to mention, they're a lot easier to move around and don't take up much space. A keyboard is a great tool for a beginner. You can always start out on a keyboard and then upgrade to a piano.
Get a learning keyboard.These specialty instruments light up in a specific order to help you learn songs more quickly. Typically, they come with books and videos that will help you learn musical notation.;
, Play with it and identify the middle tones ( middle of piano), flat tones ( left black keys), sharp tones (right black keys), bass tones (low sounds) and high tones (high sounds). Really listen to each of them, and note how they are different from the others. Keep practicing until you can tell the difference between them.

, You’ll have to study the major keys if you want to be able to identify the sounds that you hear. Some people do this by learning the major keys and then assigning a number to them. For instance, 1 is C; 2 is D; 3 is E; 4 is F; 5 is G; 6 is A; 7 is B; 8 is C. Notice how the numbers 8 and 1 both represent the note C, but number represents a lower or higher C. The number 1 represents middle C.


Once you know how to do this, you can label songs by numbers instead of letters. For instance, Mary Had A Little Lamb would be E - D - C - D - E - E - E. This would be represented as 3 - 2 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 3 - 3.
If you don’t have any musical knowledge at all, you will have wing it and figure it out by trial-and-error.

, Songs are mostly composed of variations of chords. You’ll hear them in different keys, but the chords are composed of the same notes. Identifying those notes is crucial when you’re figuring out a song by ear. So, learn how to play the basic chords and find out where they are located on the piano. Play the chords to familiarize yourself with the sound of them so that you recognize them. Even if you don’t know the chord’s name, you should know what they sound like. You should also be able to recognize if the chords are a bass tone or high tone, and from that you’ll know where they are located.For instance, C, E, G is a simple chord that you should learn to recognize in C Major first. However, it can be played in lower and higher keys as well., All songs are composed of musical patterns. Chords repeat themselves often in a steady beat or rhythm. If you can identify the patterns that you hear, it is much easier to play a song that you hear. You’ll be able to learn which chords are combined with others. This helps you to understand how melodies and baselines are constructed, which helps you to make your own.

, Humming helps you remember or compose the song. Then, you’ll be better able to repeat it on a piano. In other words, hum the tune. Then, sit down and the piano and repeat it. Once you know the chords and what the notes should look like, you should be able to duplicate them by ear.

, To really play, you need to know which fingers to play the keys with. The best way to do that is to get a basic understanding of finger placement from a beginner’s piano book. Normally, the fingers are numbered. For instance, the thumb is one and the pinky is five. These books will teach how to play each note by telling you which finger to play it with.

, Listen to songs.Then practice humming them and see if you can duplicate the song on your piano or keyboard. Or, select a song that you like and using the techniques that you’ve learned, attempt to play it by ear. Becoming a good piano player requires lots of practice. You’ll need to practice at least three times a week."

There are five accidentals per octave and they can either be sharp or flat.
Learn the names of the left-hand and right-hand staff : bass clef and treble clef

, Since you don’t have a teacher, let instructional books be your guide. There are many books available in both specialty music stores and regular book stores that will take you through a step-by-step process of learning how to read music, play basic scales, chord progressions and then simple songs.Utilize multi-media tools such as DVDs. YouTube videos also are a valuable source. If you are a visual learner, these tools will suit you well because you can see the music being played correctly.

, You will need to learn where the notes are located on the piano, what they sound like and how the note is written on the staff. To do that, you can make flash cards to identify the notes on the staff.You can purchase stickers to place on your piano to help you learn the placement of the notes. You also can purchase books that help beginners learn how to read notes.


Familiarize yourself with common chords. Start with the chords in majors. Then follow with the minors., Use the instructional books to help you learn how to play the notes. Playing the notes with the correct fingers is just as important as learning where the notes are located. If you don’t practice using the correct method, then you’ll have trouble playing up and down the scales., Playing scales helps you familiarize yourself with the notes and the sound of them. If you are learning how to sight read ,playing music while you sight read helps you learn where the notes are located and what they look like on the staff. Play the scales for each hand one at time. Then play together.

, Using your instructional books, go through the lessons. They will teach you to play easy songs as well as mastering finger placement. Practicing with easy songs also helps you to memorize where the notes are located, which improves your sight reading abilities. Start with C major. Then, work your way through the minor keys, so that you can familiarize yourself with them.


When you’re practicing a piece of music, try to play the melody and bass lines for each hand separately at first. Once your playing of each improves, then practice playing them together.

, Learning to play the piano requires a lot of practice. Play with sheet music to get better at sight reading, fingering and playing. Plan on practicing about three to four times a week for about a half hour. Don’t move on to the next lesson until you’ve mastered the previous lesson."

Practice.",How to Teach Yourself to Play the Piano3," This is the most costly, but also the most proficient way how to learn music. A good instructor will not only have a proven track record of helping beginners learn music, but also be able to teach you the basics correctly. Using an instructor helps you avoid bad habits that can take a long time to unlearn.


Review sight reading, fingering, and playing with an instructor.
Ask the instructor to review where the notes are located on the staff and the piano.

, Because your goal is to teach yourself how to play, then you probably won’t be visiting an instructor frequently. Go to an instructor once a month just to do a check-up on your progress or to ask questions about anything that is puzzling you. For instance, you might have questions about if you’re playing a song in the correct tempo.

, Once again, you will need to practice a great deal in order to learn how to play. Many people that visit piano teachers practice several times a week. So, practice two to three times a week or everyday if you like. Plan on practicing playing for at least 30 minutes two times a week, but you also will need to take time out to review your notes and sight reading abilities. You don’t need a keyboard or a piano to practice those..

Open up the piano to expose both the tuning pins and the keys.,
Play the offending note and find the strings associated with that note.

,
Hold down the key and use a guitar pick to gently pluck each of the three strings that make up the note.,
Hold down the damper pedal (the one that lifts all of the dampers) and insert a rubber wedge mute in the gap between an outer string that sounds correct and the next note over.,
Play the note to make sure that you're still hearing dissonance.,
Hold down the note and pluck the un-muted strings again.,
Place the head of your tuning lever on the pin for the out-of-tune string, with the handle in about the 1:00 position, if you are right-handed, or the 11:00 position if you are left-handed.

,
Strike the note with about a mezzo-forte blow and *gently* nudge the handle of the tuning lever a fraction of a millimeter to the LEFT (towards the lower notes on the piano - while it's unlikely the string would really be sharp, it's a good idea to try this direction first to help avoid breaking a string).,
If there is no change or you can't tell if there's a change, double-check that you have the tuning lever on the right pin.

,
If the problem is getting worse as you nudge the tuning lever to the left, then try raising the pitch of the string by striking the key and gently nudging the hammer to the right (towards the upper notes).,
As the two strings sound closer and closer, listen carefully for the ""beats"" -- a higher-pitched wah-wah-wah sound that will speed up as the two strings get more out of tune, and slow down as they closer to being in tune.

,
Continue gently nudging the tuning lever until the beats are completely gone.

,
Then nudge the lever to the right just enough to hear beats again.

,
Strike the key with a sharp blow -- with any luck it will settle into tune with the other string.,
When the two strings are sounding together, press the damper pedal and remove the rubber mute from the third string.

,
Put the piano back together and enjoy!

",How to Tune a Unison on a Piano," Depending on the piano, this usually requires removal of the front part of the upper cabinet and sometimes the key cover.;
,, Listen for which one sounds different from the others.

, This leaves two strings sounding when you play the note - one that is in tune and one that is not.

, If you are not, you have muted the wrong string, so repeat the previous step to mute the string on the other side of the unison.

, Follow the out-of-tune string up to its tuning pin.

,, Listen to the sound -- is the problem getting worse or better?

,, Strike the key EVERY time you move the tuning lever to equalize the string over all of its points.

,,,, If it goes too far, start again and try raising the string a little higher before giving it a sharp blow to try to settle it.

, Most lessons are 30 minutes long, especially for beginning players. Find out what other piano teachers in your area are charging. As a new teacher, your rate should be lower than theirs. Many starting teachers begin with a low rate of $25 per lesson and raise their rate every two-three years by a few dollars. When you're deciding how many lessons and when you want to teach each week, remember the time commitments of your students. Are they still in school? College students? Are they working a 9-5 job? You'll have to work around their schedules too. Remember to leave time for your lunch or dinner break.

, You could have them at your house, at your student's house, or at another site, such as a music store or community center. Make sure there is a piano and a chair for you and your student. It should be clean, easy to work in, and easy to get to for you and your students.

, Advertise in the newspaper, hand out fliers in your neighborhood, and tell everyone you know. If your city has a community center, ask if they have a music program that you could be part of. It would give you more credibility. Music stores are good places to find aspiring students. Ask if they have a place, such as bulletin board, window, or desk, where you could hang a flier.

, Once you have a student and the first lesson scheduled, plan out what you will teach your student at the first lesson. Introduce yourself and ask the student some basic questions about themselves. Find out if they have ever played piano before and how much they know. You could ask them to play a simple piece for you. Do they have any goals or pieces that they're working on? Why do they want to learn to play piano? What kind of music do they like? You may want to find out when the lesson is scheduled if your student is new to the piano so you can recommend books for them to buy before the lesson. Alfred Piano Course books are an excellent series for learning the basics, but there are many other series to choose from. As the teacher, you should be familiar with the books. Some teachers buy the books for the students (the student pays for the books at the first lesson) so that they can play through the pieces themselves and be able to give the student helpful hints, skip pieces that doesn't agree with your teaching principles or other things.

, Learn from them and change how you're teaching for each student. Teach on the level of the pupil. Base your lesson off them. Go their speed. They're paying for the lessons. You want them to understand why the reason behind various music techniques. Start with what they know and build off it.

, Tell them when they've improved and what they do well. Offer constructive criticism only.

, You will be able to network with other teachers and be informed with new teaching methods and publications.

, This can include private lessons from teachers that are more advanced than yourself, reading music teaching literature, attending concerts, practicing and learning new repertoire for yourself, or browsing the internet or youtube for ideas and inspirations. Remember a good teacher is also a good student.

, You could offer small prizes (candy, pens, toys, etc.) when they've achieved the practice goal you've set for them.

Put your piano in a suitable place.,
Cover the keys when not in use.,
Keep liquids at a distance.,
Play your piano.",How to Take Care of a Piano1," Pianos are made almost entirely of cast iron for the frame, steel wires set at high tension, a lot of wood, felt, and glue. As a result, they are vulnerable to high humidity and extreme temperatures. As temperatures and humidity levels fluctuate, parts of your piano swell and shrink, and in extreme cases, glue joints fail and soundboards crack.To prevent such damage, place your piano in a room with consistent temperatures and humidity levels year-round. An ideal temperature is around 70 degrees Fahrenheit; an ideal humidity level about 50 percent.


Avoid locations near AC vents, heaters, fireplaces, high-traffic doors, and rooms with large windows. Temperatures and humidity levels in these locations are less stable.
To maintain a consistent humidity level, you may have to use a humidifier in the winter when it’s less humid, and a dehumidifier in the spring and summer as humidity levels rise.
Unless your basement is climate-controlled, keep your piano above ground level.
If possible, put the piano in a room that your pets avoid.;
, Covering your piano’s keys prevents dust from accumulating between the keys and limits exposure to other contaminants such as pet hair. If your piano comes with a built-in cover (also known as a fallboard or back-fall), make sure you use it.If your piano lacks a key cover, you can buy one online or from a music store. They are easy to find, relatively cheap, and worth every penny.


You can also cover the entire piano with a drop cloth. This will protect the keys and keep dust and contaminants out of the inside of your piano.

, Spilled liquids can damage your piano’s wood finish and cause irreversible internal damage.Never use your piano as a surface for food or drink. You’ll find that the temptation to place drinks on your piano is greatest in high-traffic rooms. If your piano makes for a convenient surface for you or your guests, consider moving it to a more isolated area.

, Playing your piano regularly keeps moving parts in good working order, makes it easier to identify problems, and prevents service lapses. You should try to play your piano at least once a week.

Dust.,
Find a piano technician.,
Tune the piano regularly.,
Ask about voicing.,
Ask about regulation.",How to Take Care of a Piano2," Every couple of weeks, you should clean the piano’s keys with mild soap and a damp cloth. Dry them immediately. You can clean your piano’s outer surfaces like any other finished surface, but avoid aerosol cleaners that contain chemicals, silicon, or solvents.You should also avoid dusting the inside of your piano. Leave that to a pro.

, The care of your piano’s inner workings should be left to a registered piano technician (RPT).You can find one through the Piano Technician Guild’s webpage or through a referral. Ask friends, colleagues, or your piano dealer for recommendations. Keep in mind that this will be a long-term relationship.

, To tune a piano, a technician adjusts the tension of your piano’s 200+ strings so that notes play in the proper pitch. How often your piano needs tuning will depend on how often you play. But whether you play a lot or a little, you need to budget for tuning – about twice per year.Playing an out-of-tune piano will increase the wear on the instrument.


You may need to have your piano tuned more frequently during the first year of ownership since new wire slowly stretches (or “creeps”) during the initial months of playing.
Your piano may also slip out of tune as it adjusts to the temperature and humidity of your home.

, Voicing is the adjustment of your piano’s overall quality of sound or tone. For example, a piano’s tone can be soft, brittle, or robust.Your piano’s tone is a personal preference, and a lot depends on how you want your piano to sound. However, you should ask about voicing if your piano’s tone varies radically from note to note, if your piano can no longer play softly, or if you notice any changes in your piano’s tone.


As parts start to wear, the tone of your piano will naturally change. This is not a sign of damage.

, The more you play your piano, and the more climatic changes your piano undergoes, the more your piano’s parts settle, compact, stretch, and change dimension. Regulation involves adjusting and replacing these worn or warped parts to optimize your piano’s overall performance.You should ask your technician about regulation if you’ve had your piano tuned recently, yet your piano still sounds off.


If your piano’s keys are uneven or stick when you are playing, ask about regulation right away.

Practice Octaves.,
Practice Ninths.,
Do the same with tenths or higher depending on what you need and the size of your hands.
,
Continue using these steps for as long as it takes to span the distance you need or want.

",How to Span Large Intervals on a Piano," Some people's hands will never span more than an octave.;
, Put your pinky (or thumb, depending on which hand) on C and stretch it as far as you can. Hold this position, but don't hurt yourself. The most important thing is to feel the stretch; you don't have to go far past that. Using lotion and having regular hand massages can help your hands become more flexible.

, You will usually have to span using your left hand, but occasionally, your right hand will have a large distance to cover. Play pieces that have both. Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata is a good piece to use for this purpose. It includes ninths for the right hand and many octaves for the left hand. Chopin's Prelude No. 20 in C minor has octaves for both hands all the way through.

, Play a C octave harmonic scale going up and back down. Try to increase speed and try to keep your fingers spread.
, Play a C with a ninth (D) harmonic scale going up and back down, again keeping the span.

Advertise on music blogs and forums.,
Place an ad on a free online classifieds website.,
Sell the piano on an online auction website.,
Mention it on your personal blog.",How to Sell a Piano Online1," There are a sizable number of such websites in existence, and many of them even specialize in the sale of pianos. For the most part, there will be a fee for either posting an ad or successfully making a sale. In some cases, there may even be a fee for both. Look into the reputation and requirements of various websites and determine which would offer you the greatest benefit at the lowest cost.


The downside of these websites comes in the form of heightened competition. With so many people advertising their used pianos in one place, it will be more difficult to make your own piano stand out. On the upside, though, anyone who visits the website is definitely interested in buying a piano, so you can be fairly certain that your ad is reaching the right audience.;
, Not every blogging community or message board will allow you to advertise, so make sure you check the policy on advertisements before posting yours.


Some music and piano message boards have a special forum set aside for advertisements or will allow you to make an advertisement in your signature, especially forums dedicated to music lessons and instruments.
If a music blog you follow has been known to mention instrument sales in the past, contact the blog owner and ask about advertising your piano there. Do not simply post about it in the comments unless the blog specifically gives you permission to do so. Otherwise, plastering your advertisement in someone else’s web space is rude and may even get you banned from the blog.

, These websites specialize in the sale of used goods. Moreover, if you choose a classifieds website that allows you to advertise to your local area, you will have more leeway about how to ship or deliver the piano than you would if you sold the piano to a customer on the other side of the country. Each classifieds community has its own rules about placing ads, so make sure to review these before attempting to sell your piano there.

, Online auction websites are some of the oldest online resources for selling used goods, and they also remain some of the most frequently used websites today. For the most part, you can either set a price at which a buyer can purchase the piano flat out or you can allow users to make bids on the piano.

, Setting up a blog for the purpose of selling your piano is probably not the best use of resources unless you plan on frequently selling musical instruments through it. If you already have a blog, though, and you actually have people who follow it, mentioning that you have a piano for sale can be a good way to spread the word. This can be even more effective if you have a music-related blog, but your blog does not necessarily need to be about music for you to advertise on it.

Have reasonable expectations about price.A piano is only worth as much as someone is willing to buy it for.,
Be honest.Lying to or misleading a customer will not gain you any favor and will only result in an unhappy customer who will demand their money back.,
Be specific.,
Take pictures and video.",How to Sell a Piano Online2," If you want to sell your piano, you need to offer it at a price someone will pay for it. Base your price on expert opinion as well as your own market research. Also understand that there are many others out there who are trying to sell and even give away their used pianos, as well.


Get your piano appraised. A professional appraisal will let you know how much the piano is worth based on make and condition. Having a professional appraisal will also give validity to your sale ad, since prospective buyers will know that someone other than you has commented on the piano's value.
Find out what other pianos of the same make and quality are going for. Even if your appraiser tells you that your piano is worth a large sum, if there are a dozen others like yours that are going for a considerably smaller amount, you will need to adjust your price accordingly to be competitive with the prices set by the other sellers.

, Depending on how you sold your piano, the website you went through may deem that the customer has every right to do so, too. If the piano has its problems, be upfront about it. Even if it is in great working condition but it has a damaged leg where your dog chewed on it or your child scratched it, be honest and let your prospective customers know. A severely damaged piano may take a while to sell, but if you are honest about a mildly damaged piano, a buyer may take that as an indication of trustworthiness, thereby feeling comfortable with the notion of purchasing from you.

, Identify the piano's manufacturer and the year it was made. While the price of pianos rarely change due to time, the age of the piano, especially in conjunction with the manufacturer, can still reveal information about how the piano was made. Also share any information you have on the history of the piano along with a detailed description of its working condition and appearance.

, A picture is worth a thousand words. You might have to pay a few extra dollars to post a photo if you sell your piano through another website, but the extra money can be worth it since most buyers tend to prefer purchasing a product they can see with their own eyes. If you are selling the piano through your own blog, it can be even more helpful to have a video demonstrating how well the piano plays, allowing potential buyers to both see and hear its quality.

Learn the basic parts of the base clef.,
Remember ""All Cows Eat Grass"" to memorize the notes in the spaces from the bottom up.,
Remember ""Grizzly Bears Don't Fly Airplanes"" to memorize the notes on each line from the bottom up.,
Try out a few different mnemonics if you don't like the ones provided.,
Count through the alphabet, starting with G on the bottom line, to figure out the notes above and below the staff.",How to Read the Bass Clef1," The bass clef looks almost just like the treble clef, which is the staff you likely learned first. However, the bass clef is read differently. In general, the bass clef is used to denote the deeper, left-hand notes on Staff: This is the collection of five lines and four spaces that music is written on. Notes can go above and below the staff as well. Each line and space matches a specific note.

Ledger Lines: Lines above or below the staff, added to expand the staff. Remember, however, that they all must have spaces between them as well, which indicate notes.

Bass Clef: This is the backward ""C"" on the left-hand side of the staff. The top of the clef should touch the very top line of the staff. If this symbol is different (like a cursive ""S"" or strange ""B"") you do not have a bass clef.


Advanced music theory tip: Lowering the bass clef to the second highest line creates a ""baritone clef."" Raising it above the top line indicates a ""sub-bass clef."";
, The lowest space (the one between the bottom line and the second lowest line) represents an A. The space above it represents a C, then an E, then a G. Thus, the notes in the spaces, form the bottom up, can be remembered thusly:


-------

Grass
-------

Eat
-------

Cows
-------

All
-------, The very lowest line is a G, then a B, then a D, F, and finally A. You can make up any mnemonic you'd like, but the classic is always easy to keep in mind:


---Airplanes---
_________
---Fly----
_________
---Don't----
_________
---Bears----
_________
---Grizzly----, Don't worry if you hate thinking about bears or cows. There are a variety of other mnemonics available, and you could even invent your own if you wanted. Remember that all of these count from the bottom up, because the notes go from lowest to highest.



Spaces:

Ants Can Eat Grapes
American Composers Envy Gershwin



Lines:

Great Beagles Dig For Artwork
Good Bikes Don't Fall Apart
Garbage Bags Do Fly Away., The bass clef simply moves through the alphabet, with each line and space representing one ""move."" So, since the bottom line is a G, the space above it is an A. The line above that space is a B. The next space is a C, and so on, until you get back to another A on the top line. This will also help you with the lines above and below the staff. Simply work through the alphabet, counting each space and line equally:Your middle C is on the first ledger line above the staff. The space beneath it is a B.
The space right below the staff is an F, and the first ledger line beneath it is an E.

Test yourself with ""music reading quizzes,"" which require you to pick the note as quickly as possible.,
Hit the matching note on your instrument as you read each note.,
Practice with written music each time you practice.,
Try sight-reading to warm-up and work on your bass clef skills.",How to Read the Bass Clef2," The best way to get good is to practice, and the best practice is reading notes as quickly as you can. There are many online quizzes for free, but you can also print out a collection of notes on a bass clef (or have a friend or teacher write one) and practice identifying each one perfectly.As you get better, time yourself on each quiz. Work on improving your accuracy along with your speed -- don't sacrifice quality for speed until you can get each note without mistakes.

, Print out or write down a staff with a random collection of notes. As you identify each one, play the same note on your instrument. This will train your brain to not only identify the note but the sound and the physical positioning of each part of the staff. You'll improve your playing speed considerably as a result.

, If you want to work on reading music, in any clef, read music and play. Even if you mostly improvise, work on scales, or don't use written music, you should still devote 10-20 minutes to reading music and playing along.

, Sight reading is when you put a brand new piece of sheet music in front of you and play it as you read for the first time. It isn't easy, but it is one of the best ways to get speedy on the staff.Again, make sure you don't sacrifice quality for speed. Play it at half time if you're continuously missing notes or have to stop and start. Remember -- this is practice, not a performance.

Break the keyboard into octaves which correspond to lines on the tab.,
Locate the notes in the tab based on the octave of the line they're on.,
Read tabs from left to right, paying attention to any measure breaks (marked with I's).,
Play notes sequentially as you read from left to right.,
Read repeating numbers above or below the tab as beats.,
Learn how rests and sustains are expressed in tabs.,
Play notes marked with a period as staccato.,
Look for ""R's"" and ""L's"" on the left of the tab as a guide for which hand to use.",How to Read Piano Tabs," Piano tabs usually take the form of a series of horizontal lines, each labeled with a number at its far left, like this:5|------------------------------
4|------------------------------
3|------------------------------
2|------------------------------
Though this arrangement may at first seem to bear no resemblance to the black and white keys of a keyboard, piano tabs actually represent different regions on the keyboard through clever shorthand. The number at the left of each line represents the octave that the notes represented on the line are located in. Piano tabs define their octaves relative to the C scale - starting from the far left of the keyboard, the first C note on the piano begins the first octave, the second C note begins the second octave, and so on up to the highest C note.


For instance, in the sample tab lines provided above, the lines represent, starting from the top, the fifth, fourth, third, and second octaves from the farthest-left C, respectively. It's not necessary for piano tabs to include lines for every octave on the keyboard - just the octaves in which notes are played.;
, The letters A through G should be spread throughout the lines of the piano tab, like this:5|-a-d-f------------------------
4|-a-d-f------------------------
3|-------c-D-e-f-G--------------
2|-----------------f-e-d-c------
You may have already guessed that each letter corresponds to a note in the scale! Lowercase letters signify ""natural"" (not sharp or flat) notes, which are the white keys on the keyboard. Upper-case letters signify sharps, which are the black keys. For example, ""C"" is the black key to the right of ""c"", which is a white key. Notes on the lines of the tab are meant to be played in the octave that corresponds to the line. For instance, notes on line 4 in the sample tab above are played in the keyboard's fourth octave.


For simplification of writing and to avoid confusion between the flat symbol, which resembles a lowercase ""b"", and the note ""b"", there are no flats in piano tabs. Instead, all flats are written as the equivalent sharp (eg: D-flat (""Db"") is written as C-sharp (""C"")).

, Like pieces of sheet music, tabs are read from left to right. The notes at the far left of the tab are played first, followed by the notes to the right. If the tab is longer than the screen or page, it can ""wrap around"" below each time it reaches the edge - just like sheet music. Often, but not always, piano tabs include vertical lines marking the barrier between each measure - usually, these are represented with capital letter ""I's"" or with vertical line characters, like this:5|-a-d-f---------|---------------
4|-a-d-f---------|---------------
3|-------c-D-e-f-|G--------------
2|---------------|--f-e-d-c------
If so, treat the space between each set of vertical lines as one measure.


In other words, for songs in 4/4, there are four quarter notes between each set of lines, for songs in 6/8, there are six eighth notes, and so on.

, Start reading a piano tab at its far left and play the notes in order from left to right as you encounter them. If two or more notes are directly above each other, play them at the same time as a chord.


In our example tab:5|-a-d-f---------|---------------
4|-a-d-f---------|---------------
3|-------c-D-e-f-|G--------------
2|---------------|--f-e-d-c------
...we would first play the A in the fifth octave and the A in the fourth octave, then the D in the fifth octave and the D in the fourth octave, then the F in the fifth octave and the F in the fourth octave, then the notes C, D sharp, E, and F in sequence, and so on.

, One weakness of tabs in general is that it is difficult to express rhythm via basic tablature notation. This can become problematic when dealing with sustains, rests, syncopated passages, etc. As a workaround, some tab writers actually count the beat of the song below or above the tab. Such a tab might look like this:5|-a-d-f---------|---------------
4|-a-d-f---------|---------------
3|-------c-D-e-f-|G--------------
2|---------------|--f-e-d-c------
||1---2---3---4--|1---2---3---4--
In this case, the notes roughly above ""1"" are roughly on the first beat, the ones roughly about ""2"" are roughly on the second beat, and so on. This is hardly a perfect system, but it makes the most of the limitations of the tab format.


Some piano tabs include off-beat markings. Often, these take the form of an ampersand (""&"") to mirror the common method of counting off-beats, as in ""one and two and three and four and..."" Such a tab might look like this:5|-a-d-f---------|---------------
4|-a-d-f---------|---------------
3|-------c-D-e-f-|G--------------
2|---------------|--f-e-d-c------
||1-&-2-&-3-&-4-&|1-&-2-&-3-&-4-&


, Another weakness of the tab format is that it's difficult to express how long to hold a certain note or how long to rest between notes via tabs. Some tabs don't mark rests and sustains at all - after a held note, for instance, there will just be the series of dashes that make up the line. Other tabs will use a series of "">"" characters after notes to show that they should be held. See below:5|-a-d-f---------|---------------
4|-a-d-f---------|---------------
3|-------c-D-e-f-|G--------------
2|---------------|--f-e-d-c>>>>>>
||1-&-2-&-3-&-4-&|1-&-2-&-3-&-4-&
In this case, we would hold the final C note from beat 3 to the end of the measure.

, Staccato notes are the opposite of sustained notes - they are short, sharp, and truncated. Many piano tabs use periods to denote certain notes as staccato. See below:5|-a.-d.-f.------|---------------
4|-a.-d.-f.------|---------------
3|--------c-D-e-f|G--------------
2|---------------|--f-e-d-c>>>>>>
||1-&-2-&-3-&-4-&|1-&-2-&-3-&-4-&
In this case, we play the first three octave chords as staccato.

, Usually, but not always, the higher notes in a piece of piano music are played with the right hand, while the lower notes are played with the left hand, so it's usually safe to assume that the highest notes in a tab are played with the right hand and that the lowest notes are played with the left. However, some tabs specify exactly which notes should be played with each hand. In these cases, lines with an ""R"" at the far left of the tab are played with the right hand and lines with an ""L"" at the far left of the tab are played with the left hand. See below:R 5|-a.-d.-f.------|---------------
R 4|-a.-d.-f.------|---------------
L 3|--------c-D-e-f|G--------------
L 2|---------------|--f-e-d-c>>>>>>
O ||1-&-2-&-3-&-4-&|1-&-2-&-3-&-4-&
In this case, the fourth and fifth octaves are played with the right hand, while the second and third are played with the left.


Note that the ""O"" at the far left of the beat markings at the bottom of the tab was used simply to fill space and has no bearing on the tab itself.

Recognize lines and spaces.,
Recognize clefs.,
Recognize key signature.,
Recognize the time signature.,
Recognize measures.",How to Read Piano Sheet Music1," When you look at sheet music, you will see five lines with four spaces between them. These are collectively called the staff. Both the lines and the spaces are used as locations for notes, and where on those notes fall determines the pitch of the note. What pitch is assigned to the line or space is determined by the clef, discussed below.


Lines and spaces can also be created above and below the normal five by drawing short lines as needed to indicate the note.;
, Clefs are different shapes, located at the very beginning of a music staff, which tell you what pitches are on what line or space of the staff. They are usually recognizable because they are large and cover all five lines. Although several clefs exist, you will only need to know two for reading piano music:

A treble clef or G-clef is the clef or symbol you will usually see associated with music, so it should look familiar. It looks vaguely similar to an ampersand (or “&” symbol). The lines, from the bottom up to the top, indicate the following pitches: E,G,B,D, and F. The spaces, from the bottom up to the top, indicate the following pitches: F, A, C, and E.






A bass clef or F-clef looks a little like a backward c with two dots behind the arc. The lines, from the bottom up to the top, indicate the following pitches: G,B,D, F, and A. The spaces, from the bottom up to the top, indicate the following pitches: A, C, E, and G.







, The key signature tells you which notes get changed. The whole or normal pitches are labeled with letters (ABCDEFG), but there are also half-steps between those notes which are indicated with either a # (sharp) or a b (flat). The sharps and flats located at the beginning of the staff show the key signature and the lines or space on which they fall indicate that any note which falls in that place is played with either that sharp or flat.


Extra sharps and flats can always be placed within the music as well and will be placed next to the note they alter.
Sharp means the pitch goes up, while b means the pitch goes down.
The sharp of one note is the same as the flat of the next note up.
Sharps and flats are indicated by the black keys on your piano. This is discussed below.

, The time signature, indicated by two numbers at the beginning of the staff, tell you how many beats a note gets. The bottom number indicates what type of note gets one beat (which number corresponds to which note is indicated below) and the top number indicates how many of those are in one measure (or section of music).

, When you look at the staff, you will see occasional vertical lines drawn through the horizontal lines of the staff. The space between these lines is called the measure. Think of the measure as a musical sentence, and the line as the period at the end of that sentence (though it does not mean you should pause before starting the next). Measures help break up the music and work with the time signature to tell you how many beats to give to a note.

Inspect the piano and make notes.,
Research local or online classifieds and auction sites for price comparisons.,
Write the ad.",How to Sell a Used Piano1," Be as thorough as possible when recording details about the piano. What company produced it? How old is it? What is it made of? Are there any flaws or faults potential buyers should be aware of? The more details you can provide, the better the odds you’ll find a suitable buyer match.;
, Once you have established the condition of your piano, you can narrow your search in order to find comparable items either online, in local newspapers, or in buy-and-sell publications. Pianos for sale aren’t always easy to find, but with enough digging, you should be able to come up with a rough idea of your item’s worth.

, Be sure to keep a few things in mind:



Brief is best. Only include details relevant to the advertisement. Longer ads lose people’s interest, so keep it short and to the point.

Take a photo. Classified ads and buy-and-sell magazines generally don’t include photos with their ads, but most online sites do. Having a photo of the piano gives prospective buyers a look at exactly what they’re buying, rather than having to rely exclusively on the text in the ad.

Include detailed contact information. Most people have a preferred mode of contact. Enclose a phone number and email address so that interested parties have more than one option.

Flexibility helps. If you’re willing to barter, you’ll likely draw more interest. Include your willingness to accept someone’s “Best Offer” when creating your listing so the buyer knows you’re amenable to negotiating.

Recognize parts of a note.,
Recognize the types of notes.,
Recognize rests.",How to Read Piano Sheet Music2," Notes consist of several parts. Like the lines and circles that make up the written English language, the lines and circle of the notes change how that note functions in its musical sentence. Understand the parts of notes in order to understand how they sound.


The head is the round part of the note. It can look like an open circle or a closed dot. The location of the head indicates what pitch the note should be.
The stem is the line which it attached to the head. It can point up or down, it does not affect the music (it is only determined by where on the lines the note is located).
The flag is the little tail which you may see coming from the end of the stem. There can be one flag or two.

, There are several common types of notes which are made by changing different things about the parts that make up a note. There are also rests, which indicate that no sound is played for a certain period of time. Here is a list of the most common notes:

A Whole Note: A whole note is indicated by an open head with no stem. These are indicated with a 1 in the time signature.






A Half Note: A half note is indicated by an open head with a stem. These are indicated with a 2 in the time signature.






A Quarter Note: A quarter note is indicated by a closed head with a stem. These are indicated with a 4 in the time signature.






An Eighth Note: An eighth note is indicated by a closed head with a stem and one flag.These are indicated with an 8 in the time signature.






A Sixteenth Note: A sixteenth note is indicated by a closed head with a stem and two flags.






Joined Notes: Eighth and sixteenth notes can be joined together by turning the flags into a bar which spans between them. These are indicated with a 16 in the time signature.







, There is no elegant way to put it: quarter rests look like a squiggle. Eighth rests look like a diagonal line with one tail, while sixteenth rests have two tails. Whole rests look like a bar in the upper half of the middle space, while half rests are in the lower portion.

"
Recognize left hand and right hand lines.,
Recognize the pitches on your piano.,
Use the pedals when indicated.,
Read the lines of music.,
Go slowly.,
Practice.",How to Read Piano Sheet Music3," When you look at piano sheet music, you will see that there are two staffs which are attached at the beginning of each line and at the measures. These two lines indicate which hand plays which notes. The upper staff indicates the notes played with the right hand and the lower staff indicates which notes are played with the left.

, Each key, both white and black, represents a particular pitch and like the repeated pattern of the keys, the pitches also repeat. Look at your piano and you will see two black keys close together and then three black keys close together. Starting with the first of the two keys and moving to the very next key (including white notes) the pitches are: C#/Db, D, D#/Eb, E, F, F#/Gb, G, G#/Ab, A, A#/Bb, B, and C. The bolded text indicates a black key.


Labeling the keys while you learn may be helpful.

, You may see pedals at your feet if using a proper piano, rather than a keyboard. The left pedal is called the “soft” pedal, the middle pedal is called the “sostenuto” pedal, and the right pedal is called the “sustain” or “damper” pedal. When to use the most common pedal, the sustain pedal, is indicated on the sheet music:


The sustain pedal should be pressed when the word “Ped.” is written below a note and released when you see a star. Alternatively, you may see horizontal, vertical, or angled lines together. A horizontal line means to press the pedal, an angle means a brief release, and a vertical line means to release the pedal.

, Reading music is just like reading a language. Think of the staff as the sentence and the notes as the letters. Put your knowledge of the staff together with your knowledge of the notes and begin to play the music that you see on the page. You won’t be very good at first but you will get better and better as you get more experience.

, When first learning to play piano, play slowly. Over time you hands will get used to the movements and it will be easier to play without looking at your hands constantly. Play songs very slowly until you are comfortable and ready to speed it up.

, Reading and playing music smoothly and correctly takes time and practice. Don’t be discouraged if you don’t get it right away. If it was an easy skill to pick up, people wouldn’t be so impressed when you’re good at it! Practice every day and get help when you can.


A music teacher at your school may be able to help you learn to play the piano. You can also ask members of your community, such as people at your church, if they’d be willing to help you.
If you really struggle, consider taking a class. These classes don’t need to be expensive. Many piano students at your local university will offer discounted lessons and local community centers will sometimes offer cheap courses.

Call on an expert to find out what your piano is worth.",How to Restore a Piano1," Restoring your piano can take a big bite out of your budget, and if you are a novice, you don’t want to engage in especially risky parts of restoration and ruin the piano. Try to get an idea of your piano’s worth and overall condition before you sink money into restoring it. You can contact a local piano tech or other knowledgeable party and they can help you determine the structural and musical condition of your piano, as well as whether or not it will be feasible to restore it. If you have a piano from during or after the great depression, evaluate the materials used to construct it. If main panels are primarily composed of particleboard, it is likely less worth restoring. If it is primarily composed of wood, has a fairly thick iron frame, and is from a reputable brand it is more likely to be worth restoring. Pianos from the competitive market of 1890-1925 are often of higher quality and more comparable to well respected brands today. If you don’t know the age of your piano, you can determine what it is if you know who manufactured the piano and if you have the serial number of the piano.;

If you would rather stick with free sites, you should have no trouble getting your ad posted on high-traffic classified sites.

, Holding an auction for a used piano may not yield the best results, but listing it for immediate purchase may generate a few nibbles. You should have at least one detailed photo if you decide to pursue this route.

, Providing links to your listings on popular social media sites can increase the amount of traffic to your posting. But don’t overdo it. Badgering people on your social network can cost you friends and strain relationships.

, Use paint thinner, fine steel wool and an old lint-free cloth. As almost all pianos use a very thin veneer, avoid taking off any more material than is necessary to remove the original finish.

, If you plan to use a lacquer finish coat, you must use a filler that has the same chemical makeup as the finish lacquer. (This will prevent a reaction to the stain you use that could cause uneven color after you stain the wood.)

, Most finishes can be applied over most types of wood stain, but polyurethane varnish cannot be applied over some stains.

, Use a lint-free rag. You can also use a foam brush (use only new brushes). Stain a small area at a time and wipe away any excess to avoid streaking.

, You can apply as many coats of stain as you would like; each new coat will deepen the color.

"
"
Start applying the final finish.,
Lightly sand between each coat.,
Use a tack cloth to wipe down the wood.",How to Restore a Piano5," Polyurethane works well as a finish coat. It will seal the stain and protect your piano from moisture damage. Your finish coats will dry pretty quickly, but you should allow each coat to dry for at least 48 hours between applications.

, Use a fine-grade sandpaper or No. 000 steel wool to sand each thin coat of finish. (Two or three thin coats of finish will give your piano a professional sheen; it is a longer process, but is preferable to applying just 1 thick coat.)

, After you sand each application, wipe down the wood with the tack cloth so that all dust and other particles are removed before you apply the next coat of polyurethane. If you skip this step, you will likely end up with a bumpy and unsightly finish coat.

"
"
Make absolutely sure all the parts are dry before you begin to reassemble the piano.,
Put a piece of carpet on the floor before you begin.,
Reassemble the pieces in reverse order.",How to Restore a Piano6," Touch each piece and each part of each piece; if anything feels tacky, then it isn’t thoroughly dry.

, You can also use a large, flat piece of cardboard or a sheet. This is a preventative step that will help prevent scratches to the wood while you are reassembling the piano.

, Consult your photographs and your notes.

Start playing now.,
Practice until your fingers bleed.,
Surround yourself with talented musicians.,
Be precise.,
Learn how to read guitar tab.,
Study classical music.,
Learn the ins and outs of reading music.,
Understand chord theory.,
Play with emotion.",How to Be a Guitar God," The greatest of the great started becoming acquainted with their guitars as soon as they could get their hands on one, although there are many great guitarists who didn't even touch a guitar until their teens (Clapton and Lennon for example) or even older (Glenn Tipton, K.K. Downing, Tom Scholz) But even if you are a teen but have never held a guitar before, it's never too late to be a guitar god, so don't be discouraged. The point is to start playing as early as you can. Stop making excuses, stop saying you need the perfect guitar, stop waiting to be ""inspired,"" and stop wasting another minute to learn how to develop your inner guitar god. There's no reason to wait.


There's a very good chance that you will not be good at first. Everyone has to start out being bad, so they can improve from there. Think of it this way - babies are terrible at walking, little children struggle with talking. But they keep doing it, without feeling bad about themselves. Eventually those babies grow up to kick you in the face and insult your mother.






Can't afford a nice guitar? For now, buy an inexpensive guitar when you first start. You only need to get comfortable with the new movements with your fingers. It's only a temporary measure (see Warnings) but it's better than nothing!





;
, -- Okay, maybe bleeding fingers aren't the smartest way to go (see Tips), but you get the idea. Eddie Van Halen used to walk around his house with the guitar strapped on and unplugged, practicing incessantly; he'd sit on his bed for hours on end with a guitar while other people went to parties. Are you ready and willing to do the same? Get your priorities straight and learn to multitask. It's all about dedication and discipline.

, Ever heard the sayings, ""greatness breeds greatness"" or ""you are who you hang around""? Both statements are true. If you want to be a guitar god, you have to play with the best guitar players you can find. You will learn more in a month playing with an accomplished guitar player than you will in a year practicing by yourself. If you don't know any off hand, go meet some. Go to local shows and introduce yourself to the guitarists or connect with local musicians online.

, Just because you're starting doesn't give you an excuse to be sloppy. Like in Tai Chi, if you practice very slowly with 100 percent concentration, you'll become five times faster and better; so when you practice, do it slowly and concentrate. You'll be amazed at the results.


If you don't have an experienced instructor or high quality equipment, this may be difficult, but you have to be a stickler for technique. Do your homework and ask questions. Be persistent. If you know someone who's an excellent guitar player, don't be shy. Walk up to them with the guitar strapped on, politely request a moment of their time, and ask them if your finger placement for a particular chord or technique is correct. Most experts, when they see an error, are compelled to correct it out of their love of the art.






Study your idols. Listen to other guitarists' riffs and solos and learn them.






Some techniques that are worth learning:
Harmonics and pinch harmonics






Palm muting






Vibrato






Hammer ons/pull offs.








Scales you should be familiar with:
Major and minor






Be able to play scales forwards as well as backwards, moving from scale to scale in a given key






Pentatonic major and minor (in all the positions, so you can easily move in your solos)









, Guitar tab is the guitarist's form of sheet music. Becoming a great guitar player means learning the ins and outs of some of music's best guitar ballads. You can search the web for tabs. If you want to be the best, you have to learn from the best. A few to begin with: Jimi Hendrix, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, Eddie Van Halen, Angus Young, Joe Perry, Keith Richards, Steve Vai, John Petrucci, Jonny Greenwood, Jimmy Page, Chuck Berry, John Frusciante, and John Mayer. Learn a few of each of their greatest songs and don't forget to play them slowly until you get them down.

, It may seem worlds apart from the music you envision yourself playing, but practically all of the guitar geniuses that you look up to have studied classical technique at one point or another. Malmsteen, for example, was heavily influenced by 19th century violin virtuoso Niccolò Paganini. In the process of adapting Paganini concerto pieces on guitar, he fostered a prodigious technical fluency that would later make jaws drop. Additionally, Eddie Van Halen began his musical aspirations with classical piano before he discovered the freedom of guitar. Randy Rhoads was an avid player and listener of classical music.

, Sure, Stevie Ray Vaughan was amazing and he didn't know how to read music, but if you just sit down and learn to read and transpose music, you will be much better off. Not only will you know what sounds good, you will know how to put it into writing and you will learn deeper elements of music. Music is not just the notes you are playing, but the pause between notes and the composition of good music.

, Learn as many chords and inversions as you can. Become familiar with how they sound and why you use them. Even if you aren't playing jazz, (where you would typically hear many of these chords), knowing the notes and sounds of these chords can make your soloing more interesting. Some of the greatest rock guitar solos are actually very jazz-influenced.

, Once you've developed proficiency, you can use the guitar for freedom of expression. You can feel the music in your blood, and make other people feel it, too. Remember, the greatest musicians of all time, the ones who are most deeply respected, are the ones who could move others emotionally with their music. Music is a form of communication, if you have something to express, do your best to produce what you hear or feel. Believe you can become a breath-taking guitarist -- it makes such a difference if you know you will be brilliant.

Break out of your comfort zone.,
Write out everything you know on your favourite key including chords, scales, chord structures, scale patterns, and licks.,
Devote at least two hours daily to practice.,
Practice until you have developed muscle memory (you can play it without much effort).,
Don't be afraid of mistakes.,
As you move from one key to another, do this in perfect fourths or fifths.,
Practice all the triads (major, minor, diminished and augmented).,
Practice the seventh chords (Maj.7, Min.7, Dim.7, Dom.7, etc).,
Afterwards, begin to learn standard progressions and their substitutions on each key, one at a time.,
Begin to incorporate all the licks you already know on your favourite key into all other keys, one by one.",How to Quit Transpose on Piano," This means, stop using the transpose button gradually, until not using it becomes the new normal for you.;
, It is helpful to write out these tools using solfa notation, as this will make it easy to transcribe to other keys.

, Choose one key per week, then at the end of the week, rehearse everything you have practiced. Note the difference between practice time and rehearsal time. In practice time, you are learning new material, while in rehearsal time, you are revising the material you already learnt.

, Also, when practicing, be sure to have your fingers as relaxed as possible, as this would help improve on speed and accuracy, though much focus should be placed on accuracy

, What doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.

, For example, if you are learning Key C on a certain week, move over to Key F or Key G the next week. The reason for this is because keys a perfect fourth interval apart are very much similar, with a difference of only one extra black note. For example, if you're moving from Key C to Key F, there is only one added black note which is A#.

, Include all the inversions of the key you're learning.

, Practice their inversions of the key.

, Examples are the 2-5-1, 7-3-6, 7-3-6-2-5-1, b5-7-3, and 5-1-4.

, In about two months, with some level of discipline and consistency, you should be able to break out of the transpose comfort zone.

Remove the old strings.,
Get your new strings.",How to Change Classical Guitar Strings1," There are a few ways to do this. Some people argue that the neck still needs tension and to only change one string at a time, while others say removing all of the strings is good to clean the neck––take your pick.


Cut them. Grab a pair of scissors and snip all six strings (or just one). By cutting off the strings, you will still have to remove the small scrap parts such as the parts around the bridge.






Unwind them until they fall off. Although this way is longer, it's much safer as you won't have pieces of guitar string flying everywhere and all over your room. It's best to use a string winder as this makes the process much faster. If you don't have one, just loosen the string (like you would to tune it down) until you can slide it out of the guitar.







, If you've picked up a set of acoustic guitar strings, that usually means steel strings. You want classical. Never string a classical guitar with steel strings. This will put way too much pressure on the neck, eventually causing it to bend and crack, not to mention they sound awful on a classical. Only use classical strings on your classical guitar. You can pick up some cheap ones at a local music shop or off the internet.

Put the string through the bridge. You want it going from the inside to outside. You will probably need 4-5 inches (10-12.5cm) of string through the bridge.






Loop the string around once. You want it going under the other half of the string.






Tuck it under the loop once.






Hold the string down against the soundboard. This is important because if you do not hold the string down, it will be sticking up. This will make it loose and it will probably come undone.






Tighten it up. Do this by pulling the string from both sides.You want it as tight as you can get it.






Repeat with the 5th and 4th strings. The 6th, 5th and 4th strings are done in the exact same way, but the last three strings are done slightly different. It's mostly the same but you wind it around a few more times.

Make sure you have enough money saved up to buy a violin.,
Know where to buy.,
Go to the place you found and look at what they have in store, look at the pricing range, the quality, and the artistic touch.,
Ask for the type of wood it was made from.,
Ask for the type of varnish.

,
Ask if you can take it home to practice on it.,
Find out where and when it was made.,
Don't cheap out on the bow.,
When you are absolutely sure you've found a good violin within your budget, follow through with your purchase.

",How to Buy a Violin," You can get a student violin in a price range of about $100 - $300 dollars. Better violins can range from $400 - $50,000+. You may be able to find a decent one for about $500 - $600. Anything around $100 may not be very good quality.


The reason some violins are more expensive is because of who made them. Once you get to $10,000 the quality of the instrument doesn't change, just the ""brand"".;
, Have your mind set on where you are going to go, search the internet, looking for places that sell violins at reasonable prices, but don't go too low, or you may be buying a fake. If there's any doubt, refer to the above step when buying or look at the source. In addition, be sure to check the reviews on websites such as Amazon. Be sure to only look at reviews with verified purchases. ""How much does a good violin cost?""

, If you like what you see, continue on to Step 4. If not, go back and look for another one. After all, you're spending quite a bit of money on this instrument.

, Maple, spruce, ebony, willow, boxwood, and rosewood are the best woods, and it is recommended that you don't buy any other types.

,, Many places are very generous and will allow you to do so for up to two weeks, which is plenty of time for you to decide whether or not it is the right violin for you. Practice different techniques, styles, and pieces on it to ensure that it will respond well to all of these. Also test it out with the bow you own, as the sound a violin makes when played with one bow can definitely vary from the sound it makes when played with another.

, The violins usually have it written on the inside. Many good quality violins are from Germany, or in some cases, Austria.

, It will be tempting to, but the bow is still an important piece of the instrument. Again, look at the reviews! Bows should be about $20- $40 normally, however, higher quality bows may be above $50 or even into the hundreds. Carbon fiber is a manmade material to mimic pernambuco. Pernambuco is a very high quality type of wood; bows made of it are usually at least $100. Brazilwood is another type of wood, it is also good. Ask for the bow hair material, for real horsehair is usually better than plastic/nylon hair.,"

Adjust your seat or bench at the piano.,
Line up your feet up with the pedals.,
Practice pressing down and up on each pedal.,
Keep your heels on the floor while playing.,
Experiment with how far you depress the pedals.,
Control the damper pedal with your right foot.,
Depress the soft pedal with your left foot.,
Layer notes with the sostenuto pedal.,
Watch for pedal markings on sheet music.,
Coordinate your hand and foot movements.,
Use your own discretion when there aren’t any markings.",How to Use Piano Foot Pedals," For best posture and reach, make sure that when you are sitting your feet are flat on the floor. Also, be sure that you can comfortably reach the pedals without having to move in your seat while playing.;
, Instead of coming at an angle, position your right and left foot so that the big toe of each foot is in line with the far left and right pedals. Since you won’t be able to look at the pedals while you play piano, keeping your legs and feet straight will help you find the pedals blindly.

, Use the ball of your foot to cover only the rounded end of the pedal.Depress the pedals by pivoting your foot up and down, using only the front part of your foot. Release pedals with smooth movements because lifting a pedal abruptly and not gently will create jerky chord progressions and choppy notes.


Only use the front part of your foot to press down so that you don’t move your entire leg each time which slows down your playing.
Your right foot is only used to press down the damper pedal which is the one on the far right.
Your left foot plays both the soft pedal and sostenuto pedals which are the far left and middle pedal, respectively.

, Use only the ball of your foot to depress the pedals and keeping your heels planted. By isolating those smaller foot muscles, you’re using fine motor skills to operate the pedals more sensitively and skillfully.

, You can press a pedal down all the way, halfway, or a quarter of the way down. Each increment changes an aspect of the piano’s sound while you’re playing. Take the time to play around and listen to the changes in a note’s sound quality as you adjust the pedal.


Pressing any of the pedals lifts the dampers inside the piano. Lifting the dampers allows the strings that are attached to the piano keys to vibrate and make sounds.
Pushing a pedal part of the way down only partially lifts the dampers, so the pedal’s effects are diminished.

, On the far right of your pedal set is the damper which is the most commonly used one. This pedal lifts all dampers from the stings of the keys so that they can vibrate freely. Keep this pedal depressed to join notes together smoothly, make a group of chords crescendo, or to make a piece music resonate as it ends.Depending a musical notations, depress the damper pedal before, at the same time, or after you play a note. Each difference in timing produces unique sound effects.The dampers on all the strings are raised when the damper pedal is used, as well as the intended ones. The one set of strings’ vibrations causes sympathetic vibrations with all the other strings and also sustains the notes played until the pedal is released.

, Press the far left pedal when you play a note or chord whose quality of sound you want to soften. You can mute or incorporate an ethereal tone to your piano playing by interspersing this pedal throughout a piece.


The soft pedal manipulates the hammer that strikes the strings that are attached to any key that you play. Different keys have different amounts of strings and using the soft pedal shifts the hammer to strike fewer strings for a more muted sound.
You can still play loudly while pressing the soft pedal. Striking keys harder than normal will override the effect of the soft pedal.
Don’t use the soft pedal as an excuse not to learn to play softly. You should still be able to control your fingers to play keys quietly without a pedal., Press the sostenuto pedal at the same time as a note or chord that you want to accentuate and sustain. The sostenuto pedal will prolong the sound of that particular note while you play other notes that are unaffected by the pedal.For example, you can play a bass note and at the same time depress the sostenuto so that you can prolong the bass note while playing staccato soprano keys that are not sustained.
You can still use the damper pedal while using the sostenuto. This allows you to give multiple notes different dynamics all at the same time., Each pedal is notated by a different abbreviated word or symbol on a sheet of music. These notations are usually found running underneath of the staff for the treble or bass clef.To depress or engage the damper pedal, you will see either “ped.” in plain or flourished script.
Soft pedal markings on a sheet of music appear as “una corda” to tell you to use it and “tre corde” to stop.The sostenuto isn’t used very often but when a piece of music calls for it, there will be markings that read “sost. ped.”When the composer wants you to release a pedal, there will be a symbol that resembles an asterisk (*).

, Depending on when you play a note or chord and when you depress a pedal, you can create various sound effects. It takes practice to be able to play the piano with hands while also paying attention to where and when your feet are moving on the pedals. As you practice, go slowly so that your brain can become accustomed to multitasking.Preliminary pedaling is when you use a pedal before playing a note. This gives off a deep, rich sound because the dampers are taken off the keys and the strings are allowed to vibrate and create sound freely.
Use a pedal while simultaneously playing a note to accentuate its sound.
When you play notes while holding down the damper pedal, you accumulate volume, or cause a crescendo that grows louder as it is sustained.
Change or disengage and reengage the pedal often to help maintain tonal quality and integrity. Holding down a pedal can muddy up the sound.

, You may come across a piece of music that is void of pedal markings. As you practice the piece, pay attention to the overall tone and theme of the music. A fast-paced tune might not need a lot of damper pedal whereas a somber piece might benefit from the damper pedal as well as the soft pedal for a melancholy effect."

Wash your hands.,
Get several cleaning cloths.,
Wipe down the strings.,
Wipe the bow.,

Know when to polish your violin.,
Get the right type of polish.,
Use a cloth to polish.,

Clean your case.,
Know when it’s time for a professional tune-up.",How to Clean a Violin," After your practice session, you will likely have some rosin, sweat, and grime on your hands which you don’t want to accidentally transfer onto different parts of your violin.;
, Cleaning cloths help prevent buildup of rosin and other substances and also keep your violin looking nice by removing fingerprints and other markings. You always want to have at least two soft, clean, lint-free cloths to wipe down the various parts of your violin.


Be sure to keep these cleaning cloths in your violin case so that they’re on hand at all times.
You can buy cleaning cloths that are specially made for violin cleaning, such as SHAR or Glaesel, but you can also use what you have, such as flannel. Just be sure you are using a cloth that is soft and non-abrasive.

, It is important to wipe down the strings of your violin after each playing session because rosin can quickly accumulate and change the sound of your instrument. This is an easy step that should become a regular habit after practicing.


Using one cloth, wipe the rosin off each individual string, moving up and down each string in a sliding motion. Be sure to wipe off any rosin flakes that might break off during this step.
If there is a build-up of rosin on your strings that you cannot wipe off, you can use pure alcohol to remove this. Put a few drops of alcohol on the cloth and rub on the strings, but be careful to ensure that the alcohol does not touch any other part of the violin as alcohol will damage the varnish., Just like on the strings, rosin can build up relatively quickly on the bow. You can use the same cloth you used for the strings as you are wiping away the same substance.


Just as with the strings, simply take the cleaning cloth to wipe down the bow in the direction that the hairs are running in. Do not go against the grain, just wipe up and down using a light touch.

, The face of the violin refers to its body, excluding the strings or neck of the violin. You will want to use a different cloth for this step, as you want to avoid rubbing rosin or any other substance onto the violin.


When wiping the F-holes, take care to ensure the cloth does not get caught in them. The woodwork of F-holes is delicate and can change or ruin the sound of the violin if damaged., The bridge of the violin is liable to have collected some rosin during your practice session. Use a cloth to dust the rosin out from under the bridge but maintain a light touch, as the bridge is very fragile.


Try using a Q-tip for those spots that are especially hard to reach.

, Having a polished violin keeps the varnish in good shape and also takes care of the gunky build up that inevitably occurs after years of playing any instrument.


If your violin is new or in good shape, you may not need to polish it at all. However, if your instrument is dull and hasn’t been polished in a long time (a year or more), you may want to polish it. Check with your luthier (a specialist in string instruments) if you aren’t sure.

, Only use a commercial violin polish rather than furniture polish or water as these can damage both the varnish and sound of the violin.Never use violin cleaners or polishes on master instruments or antiques, because the oils they contain could open a crack and make your instrument difficult to restore.Polishes generally contain some type of oil, which can create fissures in the violin’s wood and damage the instrument in the long run. Therefore, there is some disagreement over whether polishes should be used on violins at all., If you do decide to use polish on your violin, be sure to follow the specific instructions that come with your polish and be careful to only polish the body of the violin.


Apply polish to the cloth, not directly on the instrument. Rub out the smudges, dirt, any rosin buildup, using the cloth. Buff on all sides, but be careful around the F-holes to prevent polish buildup. Then take a separate rag to wipe off any excess polish to prevent moisture from entering in and damaging the violin.
Avoid the strings and bridge of the violin as you don’t want any polish building up on these parts and affecting the sound of the instrument.

, The oils and sweat on your skin can attack the varnish of your violin and leave marks. The less skin contact you make with your violin, the longer it will last in terms of great sound and appearance.


Practice lifting and holding your violin as little as possible until it becomes second nature to not grab and touch your violin all over its body.

, Though people often forget about this step, your violin will not stay clean if its storage case is not clean. Empty and vacuum out your case once a week or once you start seeing flakes of dust, dirt, and rosin.


This step has the added benefit of preventing dust mites that may eat your violin’s bow hair., If you start to notice cracks or other changes in your violin, it’s time to take your instrument into a reputable violin maker or music store.

Research bow materials.,
Decide what size and weight are right for you.,
Learn about the importance of shaft shape.,
Study the importance of national origin.",How to Buy a Violin Bow1," One of the most important factors to consider in buying a bow is what it is made of. Depending on your level of experience, monetary resources, and personal preferences, there are four different choices you could make:Fiberglass bows are the most inexpensive. They come with many student violins. They are durable and affordable, but not adequate for more advanced players.
Brazilwood is the term used to describe bows made from tropical hardwoods. These are inexpensive bows that are ideal for beginners or intermediate players.
Pernambuco, a dense, heavy wood from Brazil, has been used in most of the best bows since the 18the century. Pernambuco bows are increasingly rare, due to environmental devastation, and therefore are much more expensive. However, these bows are thought to provide an ideal balance of strength, responsiveness, and elasticity for the advanced violinist.
Carbon-fiber bows are built to approximate the qualities of pernambuco, and have become increasingly popular in recent years as the real thing has become harder to obtain. They are a reasonable approximation of their wooden counterparts, and are more affordable and durable.;
, Violin bows come in a variety of lengths and weights, and choosing the right one is important for maximizing your potential as a violinist.


The average adult violin bow weights about 60 grams, and some violinists will not play any bow that strays much from this weight. However, some high quality bows weigh as little as 54 grams, so don't be afraid of a lighter bow. On the other hand, a bow weighing more than 66 to 68 grams will be too heavy for most violinists.The size of the bow is also important. Too long a bow can be cumbersome for children and other people of smaller build, but a short bow loses some flexibility, thus limiting the range of expression possible.Anything smaller than 3/4 size will result in a loss of flexibility. The good news is that student learners generally will not have the technical skills required for the sophisticated bow strokes a longer bow allows for anyway., Violin bow shafts come in two different shapes: round and octagonal. Octagonal bows are generally harder to find.Many violin players prefer the look of octagonal bows.
That said, octagonal bows are often stiffer, which decreases the flexibility of a bow and limits some of the nuance that can be achieved in your bow strokes.

, Especially when buying a vintage bow, many expert players consider the country of origin of the bow to be important.English bows are almost always made for professional use. Those from the 1920s and earlier are particularly sought after.
German bows have a bad reputation because historically, many of the cheap student bows were manufactured there. Even so, there have been many fine German bow makers such as Heinrich Knopf and Otto Hoyer.
Vintage French bows are the most sought after (and expensive) of all. If you're buying a newer bow, you can get a close approximation made elsewhere, as the Parisian style of bow-making has spread to the US, the UK, and Ireland.

"
"
Visit a shop.,
Check the straightness of each bow.,
Test the strength of each bow.,
Play-test the bows.",How to Buy a Violin Bow2," The best way to choose a bow is by visiting a music shop, so that you can inspect the bows first-hand. Especially for an advanced player, you do not want to buy a bow online.Bring your own violin when you go the shop. You will want to determine how any bow you are considering buying feels with your violin.

, The violin bow should be straight from end to end when examined on a flat surface.


Another approach is to hold the bow away from you and look down the length of the shaft. If there is a slight curve to the left, this may be acceptable, but any curve to the right is not. A curve to the right increases the chances of the shaft hitting the strings., For each bow you are considering, test it's strength by pulling it across the strings of your violin once, with normal playing pressure. Tightened to normal tension, the shaft should not touch the strings when you do this.Likewise, the bow should not bend to the left or right when played with normal force.

, Once you've narrowed the bows down to a few that are strong, straight, and in your price range, test each bow by playing a piece of music you are familiar with. This way, you will know if the bow feels right playing music you would normally play.Specifically, take note of the following:


Responsiveness/bounce. A bow should have little bit of bounce when it strikes the strings. This is part of what allow for quick bow strokes.Start each bow off playing slowly, and then gradually increase your speed to see how it performs.
Balance. Hold the bow at a 45 degree angle. It should feel balanced an comfortable from end to end.Sound. Even with the best violin, a bow which is too flexible may not have a clear sound, while one that is not flexible enough may have a rough or ""edgy"" sound. Find a bow that sounds good to you.
Natural feel. The true test of a bow is whether or not it feels right. This is a somewhat subjective criterion, but the right bow for you will feel natural to play with. You shouldn't have to think about the bow while you are playing.

"
"
Compare prices.,
Compare warranties.,
Purchase the best bow you can afford.",How to Buy a Violin Bow3," Check the prices of the different bows you've tested. Remember that the highest-priced bow is not necessarily the best one.


A fiberglass bow should cost about $20 to $50.A Brazilwood bow should cost between $50 and $200.A pernambuco bow could cost between several hundred and several thousand dollars, with antique French bows at the high end of the range.A carbon fiber bow should cost about $300.

, A new violin bow will often come with a warranty covering defects or other problems. These warranties usually will not cover replacement of the hair.If you are buying a bow brand new, consider your warranty options. Bows are expensive and you don't want to have to pay to replace yours if it turns out to be defective in some way.
Used and vintage bows will probably not have a warranty.

, Taking into account quality, cost, and warranty, select the best bow you can afford. Take it home and start playing!


If you are still uncertain about which bow to buy, some stores will allow you to take a bow home and try it for a few days."

Listen to feedback.",How to Write a Song for Piano," Do you want to write a pop song, a country song or even a classical song? Take some time to listen to a few examples of whichever you choose to get a feel for them.


Take note of the rhythms and structure of other songs of the type you choose. Your notes will help you stay on the right track.
Choose the type of song you’d like to listen to. It will keep you motivated.;
, Take a few minutes to meditate about the things that are important to you. You may want to write a love song for your sweetie or a song about a historical event. Make sure your topic is something you personally connect with. Give your song an emotional core.

, How do you want your audience to feel when they listen to your song? Your tone will affect the way you write the song. A song about a new love would likely be upbeat and happy, while a song about the death of a loved one would likely be slow and somber.


Elton John’s emotional tribute to Marilyn Monroe, “Candle in the Wind,” is a perfect example of a song with a powerful somber tone. Over twenty years after he wrote the song, John would play it beautifully at the funeral of Princess Diana.Bruno Mars’ “Amazing,” about the joy of being in love, is a perfect example of a song with an effective upbeat and happy tone.
Think about your feelings toward the subject of your song and choose a mood that will communicate it to the audience.

, Always keep your eyes and ears open for possible titles. You never know where you might find a great one. Skim newspapers. Read books. Have conversations. The perfect title could reveal itself to you in the unlikeliest of places.Another great way to find a title is to make a metaphor for your topic.
If your title comes from a conversation with someone else, be sure to ask that person permission before you use it.

, Play around on your piano for a while and try to find a tune that fits your mood. Try to feel the the emotion you wish to invoke while you play. If it’s a happy song, let your fingers be light and bouncy. If it’s a sad song, slow everything down and take time to let the notes resonate.


You can even hum your melody first and then try to find the corresponding keys on the piano.
Keep it simple and catchy for now. You’ll build on it later.

, You can download blank staff paper off the internet or buy it at almost any music store. If you prefer, you can even create your own. Make two rows of five straight lines, one on top of the other with some space in between. Then split each row into four columns to make the measures.


Be sure to use a ruler so that you get clear straight lines.

, A time signature notifies you how a song will be counted. You’ll see it written like a fraction at the beginning of any piece of music. “Common” time means that the song has a signature of 4/4. The top number means that you’ll have 4 beats in a measure. The bottom number means that you’ll count each beat as a quarter note. In common time, there a few different types of notes that have varying values.A half note has the value of two quarter notes or two beats.
A whole note has the value of four quarter notes or four beats.
An eighth note has the value of one half of a quarter note.
A dot immediately following a note increases that note by half its value. A half note would then last for three beats.

, The key is basically the arrangements of sharps and flats in your song.If you have no sharps or flats in your scale, you will be in the key of C major. For every fifth you move up from C, you add a sharp (black key above a note) to your scale. If you move from the key of C to the key of G, you would add an F sharp. For every fifth you move down from C, you add a flat to your scale. So if you dropped from the key of C to the key of F, you would add a B flat. This system is called the circle of fifths.


The order in which sharps are added is F,C,G,D,A,E,B.
The order in which flats are added is reversed, B,E,A,D,G,C,F.
Minor keys have a darker tone and follow the same rules. The key of A minor has no sharps or flats and you can move up or down from there.

, A good chord progression for your song will give it rhythm. There are few different chord progressions you can follow. One of the most popular is the Nashville progression. To use the Nashville progression, you’ll have to find your root chord, (the same as your key) your dominant chord, (the fifth chord above your root) your sub-dominant chord (the fourth chord above your root) and the six chord (this will be a minor chord).This may sound confusing but it’s actually pretty easy. If you’re in the key of C, you would count a fifth step from C to find your dominant chord. You would say “C,D,E,F,G.” G would be your dominant chord.
In the key of C, C is your root chord, G is your dominant chord, F is your sub-dominant chord, and A minor is your six chord

, Your chorus will be the most recognizable part of your song. It’s the part of your song that will hook your audience in. You’ll repeat it, exactly the same way, over and over throughout your song. You want it to be as catchy as possible.


You can set your chorus apart from the rest of your song by making it louder.
Make it emotionally moving. Your audience will likely connect with your chorus more than any other part of your song., Verses tell the story of the song.If your song has lyrics, your verses should relate to the chorus. Your song should have several verses and each one should come before a chorus. All your verses should have a similar tune.


You can make each verse its own story or you can continue a story through all your verses.
Your last verse should be the payoff. It should reward the audience for listening to the song and end the story. For example, if your song is about falling in love, the last verse may be about when the lovers finally kiss.

, Your bridge will only appear in your song once. It serves to break up the song and its tune should be very different, musically, than that of the rest of your song. A good place to put your bridge is after two cycles of your verse and chorus.Introduce a new tune or rhythm in your bridge.
Try to surprise your audience with a unique bridge they never expected. .

, Write down your melody on your staff paper. Remember that most of the tune of the song should be written in the treble clef (the top clef to the right of middle C on the piano) and played with your right hand. The notes in your bass clef (the bottom clef to the left of middle C on the piano) should be played with your left hand and used mostly to keep rhythm.Chords in your bass clef can be a great way to keep rhythm.


The notes on the lines in the treble clef from bottom to top are E,G,B,D,F. They can be remembered by the device “Every good boy does fine.”
The notes on the spaces of the treble clef are F,A,C,E. You can remember they spell face.
The notes on the lines in the bass clef are G,B,D,F,A. You can remember them with the device “Great big dogs fight animals.”
The notes on spaces of the bass clef are A,C,E,G. You can remember them with the device “All cows eat grass.”

, When you’ve written all the parts of your song, arrange them in the best possible order. Decide how many times you want to repeat your melody and chorus. Choose the best place to play your bridge. Find the best flow for your song.


You can always change this later on. What sounds like the best arrangement today may not sound as good the next day.

, Write an attention grabbing intro to begin your song. Make sure it fits in with your key and time signature. Keep the intro short and sweet, you want to move into the meat of your song as quickly as possible.


Sometimes intros can be longer. The keyboard solo at the beginning of “Baba O’Riley” by The Who is an example of a long intro being used very effectively to build suspense.

, Play your song as many different ways as you can. Experiment with making parts of it louder and softer. You may even change parts of the song entirely the more you play it. Be creative and let yourself explore new possibilities.


Keep track of what you revise just in case you change your mind later.

, After you’ve played your song a few times, decide whether or not you want to add lyrics. If you’re writing a complex, classical song, it may not need lyrics. Most pop songs however, do have lyrics. If you do decide your song needs lyrics, try to write words that are catchy and that fit into the mood of your song.


One way to write catchy lyrics is by making them rhyme. In “Imagine” John Lennon says “Imagine there’s no heaven. It’s easy if you try. No hell below us. Above us only sky.”

, Play your song over and over until you can play it comfortably without much thought. Practice your song slowly until you can play it perfectly so that your mind has time to absorb everything and your fingers build the correct muscle memory.Break the song down. Try to learn only a few measures at a time. When you have those down perfectly, move on to the next few measures.
When you start to lose concentration, take a break. You’ll be wasting your time trying to play the piano if your brain is too tired to focus.

, You’ll need someone to perform for. The first few times you perform you’ll want a supportive audience as everything might not go as planned. Your friends and family are unlikely to be too critical if you make a few mistakes the first few times you perform your song for them.


As you gain experience, you may want to visit open mics or find other places musicians can perform.

, Share your hard work with the world. If you start to feel a little bit of performance anxiety, take deep breaths until you feel yourself relaxing. Better yet, you can channel all our nervous energy into your performance.Try to feel all the emotions you felt writing your song when performing it for an audience.

, You don’t have to pander to everyone’s opinion but you should at least hear it. You may get great advice about how to make your song more interesting or tips on how to put on a more exciting performance.


Take criticism with a grain of salt. Sometimes people will be jealous of your skill and say things just to be mean.
Run everyone’s advice through your own filter. Sometimes well-meaning people may give bad advice.

Identify the strings for violins, violas, and cellos by the silk windings at the peg and tailpiece ends.,
String fractional size instruments with strings specifically designed for that instrument.,
Remember that on a violin, the E-string is usually offered with either the ball-end or a simple wire loop-end at the tailpiece end.,
Remember that on a viola, the A-string is occasionally offered with either the ball end or a simple wire loop end at the tailpiece end.",How to Buy Violin Strings," Most strings, other than the E-string on a violin, are produced with a “ball-end” at the tailpiece end. This ball-end slips down through the appropriate hole in the tailpiece so that when the body of the string is slid up into the slot, the ball prevents the end of the string from coming through.;
, Using strings designed for other size instruments will not produce a desirable result.

, Nearly all E-strings are steel and react with large changes in pitch to very little change in string tension. For this reason, most instruments have a mechanical fine tuner mechanism attached to the tailpiece to accomplish the small changes in tension needed.

, Some viola A-strings are steel, and react with large changes in pitch to very little change in string tension. For this reason, some instruments have a mechanical fine tuner mechanism attached to the tailpiece to accomplish the small changes in tension needed.

End with some fun time.",How to Practice Violin," Whether it's violin, basketball, or teaching yourself how to speak Klingon, everybody has a time during the day when they're at their peak. When do you feel the most awake, energized, and capable of taking over the world? That's when you should be practicing your violin.


This is different for everyone. It could be right when you wake up, in the middle of the day, or even at midnight. It could last 2 hours or it could last 25 minutes. When is it easiest for you to practice? Clear your schedule for that time.;
, You need a practice space that's away from distractions. No TV, phone, or friends or family members barging in and out. And if the acoustics are good, that's a plus, too.


It should be a place you feel comfortable practicing in as well. Ideally, it's open and uncluttered and a space where you feel like you can actually get things done in. What's more, it shouldn't be somewhere that bothers others, either.

, In order to even get started, you'll need your music, a pencil and paper, and your music stand for starters. Did we mention your violin? That, too. What else helps you get going? For some it's a certain chair or a recording device. You'll be in there for a few hours most likely, so it's best to come prepared.

, In addition to taking care of the things you actually need, take care of the things that just make it easier, too. A bottle of water, a comfortable pair of pants, a snack, whatever. Feeling good will make your practice time more productive and make it easier to concentrate.


Being ready and raring to go is part of the battle for productive practicing. If you're not in the mood, you're practice time is going to be dull and, well, a waste. But if you feel good physically, practice will just come that much easier.

, You know how lots of people believe that you don't really become a master of something until you've done it for around 10,000 hours? Well, it's true and it's not. It's 10,000 hours of deliberate practice – meaning that if you practice for 20,000 and you're not focused, you still won't be any good. So don't really worry about the duration of your practice. As long as you're focused, you'll improve.We'll talk about this a bit more in depth later, but for now just worry about every minute being mindful and focused, not just racking up the minutes. After all, practice doesn't make perfect, practice makes habits. And not all habits are good.

, You wouldn't run a marathon cold, so don't go marathon practicing cold, either. Start by limbering up your fingers with scales, arpeggios, exercises, and trills. Even the most seasoned of violinists has to start with a warm-up.


Depending on how much time you have, your warm-up session should be about 20 to 30 minutes in length.It's a good idea to work in the key of the piece you're working on, too.

, Every time you walk into that practice room, have a purpose in mind. And it shouldn't be ""to practice violin,"" either. It needs to be something specific – a goal you can work toward. Whether it's fixing a problem spot, polishing a piece, or starting on a new one, have that lined out at the start. And then at the end you'll know if you accomplished it or not.


You'll note that with every session, your purpose likely changes. One by one, each little goal will get crossed off, until you're working on more and more skilled issues. This will give you a sense of progress and accomplishment, too, aiding in your motivation to keep going.

, Too often when anyone is practicing anything they just go over it again and again and again until they're exhausted and need to put it down. This isn't good practice – this is practicing your mistakes. Every time you run into a problem, be willing to stop, take a look at this issue, and then do it differently. It'll take more time, but it'll help you reach your goals.


Take a problem spot and stop. Section it off into the bit that you find challenging. Then concentrate on only that part. Start by playing it slowly until it starts sounding better. When it does, gradually up your tempo until you have it down.

, When we're in the heat of the moment, whether it's violin or otherwise, our brains are so focused on getting the job done that we often don't realize what we're doing wrong. Our foot went too far to the right on the dismount, we sang a note a third too high, or we didn't notice the music in front of us indicated a full rest, and not a half. But if you record yourself, you'll be able to look back and hear where you went wrong, even if you didn't notice it in the first place.


If you keep flubbing up on a fast passage, break it down. Play the series of notes, only repeat each note three or four times before moving on (d-d-d-d-e-e-e-e-a-a-a-a), sort of like a bowed tremolo.As you get used to it, you'll have the pattern down and can take out the extra notes.

, Imagine handing a computer a piece of music and having it play it. Technically, it'd be correct, but it wouldn't be good. Your musicality is your ability to interpret and play the piece with feeling. If your notes are lacking something, this very well could be it.


To get started finding this, experiment with different phrasings and variations in tone, style, and intensity. And once it's memorized, you'll be even freer to explore. Once it's ingrained, you'll be able to make it your own.

, To be really good at playing the violin, you've got to be able to hear the music you're playing and improvise with it, much like a jazz musician. This skill makes you and the music one and the same. You can hear it still going in your head even though you're playing different notes. Once you've got a piece down, try adding your own flair to it and seeing what happens.


To experiment, start by playing the bassline of a song you know well. Then continue playing the line in your head while you improvise on top. It takes the piece to a whole new level and can be very liberating., Playing violin can be surprisingly strenuous on a person, especially if you mentally get into it. In the beginning, you'll find that getting through a movement is difficult and takes its toll on you. Start by just doing a piece full out and adding in passages from there. When you start feeling worn out, make note so you know what to aim for in tomorrow's session.


Sometimes it's a good idea to practice like you're performing. They're two very different levels of energy, and it's good to know where your stamina lies. Go through the entire movement, if possible, and see how it makes you feel.

, Remember in the beginning of this guide how we talked about not worrying about how much time you put in? It's good to practice every day, but beyond that, it's sort of up to you. After all, 5 hours a day of mindless practice won't do you nearly as much good as 1 hour of mindful, focused practice. So when you're there, focus yourself and aim to not repeat your mistakes. You'll be grateful you did later.


Mindless practice is what makes people stop because you get nowhere in your progress and it's dull and boring. You won't like it, you'll lose your motivation, you'll cease practicing, and you'll just get worse. Avoid this by keeping your head in the game and you'll be golden. Make it count.

, In short, never trust your memory. You'll end up thinking to yourself, ""I think yesterday I stopped somewhere around here...and I had an issue with this bit, but I can't really remember what it was."" Clearly that's not going to do you much good. Instead, bring a notebook with you and after you're done, write down a summation of the day's practice. Then tomorrow you can pick up exactly where you left off.


Write down anything that you think will be useful, whether it's a problem you're having or a method you found around the problem you're having that you don't want to forget. You could even log your time and plan out the week's schedule, too.

, At the end of each session, you deserve a reward. Spend your last ten minutes or so having fun. Take an easy piece and play it however you like. Turn it into a dirge, speed it up, and see just how different you can make it sound. Play a piece that makes you smile. Odds are you'll notice that it, too, is sounding better and better.


Practicing something every day becomes a drag before long. This 10 minutes may seem like a bit of a waste, but in the long run, it could keep your spirits up. Ending on a high note will make it that much easier to come back to it tomorrow. And the day after that, and the day after that, and the day after that.

Gather the wood.,
Prepare the wedges of wood.,
Start with the form and the corner blocks.,
Start bending the maple veneer into the ribs.,
Start carving the front and back plates.,
Carve the neck.,
Pry the blocks and ribs away from the form with a chisel or a flat-bladed screwdriver.,

,
Put on the peripherals.",How to Build a Violin," Most of a violin is usually made from spruce and maple. The back plate, the ribs (the bendy sides), and the neck are all made from maple. The front plate, usually spruce.


You'll need a wedge of maple for the back, a block of maple for the neck, lots of strips of maple veneer for the ribs, and a wedge of spruce for the front.
You'll also need to get hold of a 'form' and some smaller spruce blocks - the form is a block of wood curved like the shape of the violin body, to bend the maple around to form the ribs.
The small spruce blocks go in the corners of the violin, to keep the ribs together and provide support.
To get hold of all of these, ready-prepared, try luthier supply websites, such as for the UK, or for elsewhere.
Use Google to your advantage.;
, They have to be fully sawn down the middle, so they are split into two pieces that are only half as thick. They then have to be glued together at the ends so that they represent a plate of wood that can be cut out for the back and front plates. This must be done for both the front and back plates. View for more details.

, Glue the small spruce blocks to the block-shaped orifices in the edge of the form. Use a file or a large gouge to file down these blocks so that they follow the curves of the edge, and form the corners of the violin shape.

, You can shell out a fair amount of money to buy a bending iron - a tool designed to bend the ribs, or you can use a household iron instead, though results will be inferior.


You'll need 6 different bent parts, one for each space between blocks - top left, top right, middle left, middle right, bottom left and bottom right.






If you're using an iron, you can use old pens or bits of wood, and rubber bands, to hold one end of each strip in place, as you 'iron' the rest of the wood around it. This will take some time.
Careful with the middle bits, they will need to be bent before you put them on the form.
When that's done, glue each strip to the block at each end, and trim the edges to that it's neat and tidy. Do NOT glue any of the ribs to the actual form, the form will be removed later.

, This step will probably take a long time.


Start by using some templates (you can draw around an existing violin, or look online for some templates and measurements) and roughly saw around your outline to get the general shape.
You can file or sand down the edges to fit your lines. From there you have to carve it to the right shape and curve. The bottom of each plate must always remain perfectly flat, and the very edge must always be the same thickness all the way around (about 0.5cm).
Use that as a guide line to gouge or file down the edges to the right thickness, and from there work down the outside of the plate to a pleasing-looking curve. The insides of each plate must also be gouged out, and must follow the contours of the outside.

You can use a drill to help you with this, you can cut out most of the wood much faster.


You must follow this whole process with both the back and the front plates.
Cut out the F holes from the front plate with a drill and a small hacksaw - you should use a diagram for this. More experienced violin-makers will also embed purling into the front and back plates around the very edge. You will also need to put a ""Bass bar"" in the front plate - a bar of wood glued to one side of the inside of the plate, that follows the line of the lowest string. This is for better bass response.

, You should use some diagrams to help you with this. The wrong length of neck could have disastrous effects on the intonation. Spend time smoothing and curving the scroll perfectly. You can use a drill to help you cut out the peg-box. Make sure it is perfectly smooth.

, File or gouge down the insides of each block to create a smooth curve with the rest of the inside of the ribs. Use your bending iron or household iron again to bend some very thin and narrow pieces of maple veneer, and use them to glue to the top and bottom of the inside of the ribs. This is for structural support, and to give the front and back plates something to glue on to.

, Cut out a small section (shaped like the end of the neck) from the front block of the ribs and top plate for the neck to slot into. Keep working at this until the angle of the neck is just right.

,, You'll need a soundpost, tailpiece, fingerboard, pegs, bridge, and strings. You'll also need a bow to play it with.

Find students.,
Start with the basics - all of them.,
Bowing is more important than many people want to make it.,
Precise intonation is also overlooked too often.,
Be picky about rhythm as well.,
Ask them to set goals for their own practice time, and check that they stick to it.",How to Be a Violin Teacher," Advertise using flyers laminated to prevent soggy pages when it rains. Volunteer to assist with an orchestra, and make friends with the school orchestra teacher. Even check out local string stores to see if they're hiring or if they'll let you advertise.;
, Knowledge of music theory is extremely important and often overlooked. Teach them the basics of conducting. Sing with your student(s). Be patient: don't assume they know anything unless they've proven it. Only move on when they can reteach you what they've learned.

, Make proper bowhold and straight, full bowing a priority.

, Be pickier than you want to be; it's easy to let approximation go but it's hard to retrain the ear once that's gone on for years and they want to move to a higher level. Use the process of tuning the violin to test your student's ear; have them do it themselves as soon as it's possible, and have them tune in 5ths to their other strings.

, Teach them to count everything. Insist on a consistent tempo in études and scales.

, If they don't, or if their goals are unacceptable, have them fill out practice records.

Find time to practice every day.,
Prior to starting clarify the goal of each practice session.,
Practice with a metronome.,
Don’t try to learn new songs all at once.,
Focus on your technique as you play.",How to Practice Piano1," It is much easier to learn piano if you practice every single day, building off your prior successes and lessons. Even practicing for 20-30 minutes each day is better than only practicing once a week for a few hours. Everyday practice helps cement what you are learning. Create a practice chart with the time during the day you will practice and mark off each day you do. Place on a wall you pass often to remind you and don't forget to add a reward onto it when you have completed a certain amount of days. The more frequently you practice, the faster you will improve so don't take weekends off. Any practice everyday is better than no practice.;
, Start with a warm-up. Just like athletic practices, your body and brain need 10 minutes to get going and reach their full potential. Some ideas for warm-ups include:


Run up and down your scales 3-4 times.
Play 2-3 songs that you already know well, focusing on making them perfect.
Play along to a song you know, or improvise some notes while listening to another instrument.

, Metronomes keep a constant rhythm for you, helping you stay in time as you practice. Most musicians will unconsciously play parts they know faster and slow down for parts they don’t like. This may seem fine when you are on your own, but if you try to do this with a band the entire group will fall out of sync.


Start slow, around 60 BPM (beats per minute) if you are not used to using a metronome.
Some music charts will list a BPM on the top, so set your metronome to this number to practice the song correctly.

, Instead, focus on learning one section at a time, anywhere from 10-15 seconds, and perfecting it before moving on. This allows you to confidently play the entire song well, as opposed to rushing though it and missing your mistakes.


If you come across a difficult section, stop and work on it before moving on. It is difficult to lose bad habits once they are engrained.

, Your goal should not be to get through a piece, it should be to play it perfectly. Practicing is the time to make mistakes, not take shortcuts, so try to find your mistakes and work on ways to fix them. If you struggle with a particular scale, make that a part of your daily practice until you have it. If you can’t play a fast piece completely, play it slow and add speed over time until you nail it.

Hire a teacher for personalized, hands-on lessons.,
Learn to read music.,
Learn the basics of music theory.,
Buy a chord and scale book.",How to Practice Piano2," Usually, the fastest way to learn how to play the piano is with a teacher. They not only know the scales, songs, and chords that you need to practice, but they can give you specific advice on how to improve your playing. Make sure you like the teacher to a fixed term. When looking for a teacher, be sure to discuss the following:


Your goals in playing the piano (songs, bands, career, etc.)
What genres of music you want to practice
The teacher’s qualifications and experience
The teacher’s cost and availability

, Most piano music is written on charts in musical notation, and it is rare to find a piano player who cannot read music. Purchase a book, watch videos online, get a music learning app or ask your teacher to help you learn so that you can play any music you can get your hands on.


Practice reading music each day so that it becomes second nature. You can try to play pieces by sight, bring charts with you on the bus, play songs frequently or play musical games online.

, Music is built on a set of rules and relationships between notes, and knowing music theory allows you to see the patterns in your favorite songs and learn them more quickly. You can always take a course, but there are also a variety of books and online tutorials meant to teach people music theory, from the basics to complex arrangements.

, Available at every music store, these books are relatively cheap glossaries of every piano chord you could play. They are usually grouped together by note, but frequently they come with sections detailing which chords sound good together and the right scale to play for each note.

Expect to spend a few hundred dollars on a decent beginner's violin.


Buy full size or 4/4, if you're an adult. The violin is a small instrument, but there are specially designed smaller sizes available. These are generally only intended for very young children, so be sure the violin you're buying is full size unless you're very small. You can ask the shop for a recommendation if you aren't sure.
You can also ask the shop to measure your arm length to see what size violin you need. When holding the violin in the playing position, straighten your left arm and the tops of your fingertips should be near the top the violin scroll. If your arm is way past the top, the violin is too small.
Buy from a reputable seller. Music stores stake their reputations on selling solid instruments that are free of obvious flaws and damage. As a beginner, you won't be able to coax a very pleasant sound from your instrument for some time, so flaws in privately sold violins might not be apparent to you until it is far too late to complain. Only buy from a store or individual you can trust.;
, Unless you have purchased the instrument only, your violin outfit should come with a violin with four strings, a bow, and a carrying case and most of the time a chin rest and rosin for your bow. In most cases, the person who sells you the violin will be happy to string it for you, which has the added bonus of double-checking to be sure the tuning pegs (the knobs at the scroll, or top, of the violin) are properly fit to the scroll. A hard case is important because violins are such delicate instruments.


Strings come in three basic varieties: gut, which is expensive and difficult to take care of, but which offers a complex range of sound; steel, which is loud and bright but can sound scratchy, and synthetic, which is smooth, clear, and not as unpredictable as gut. Each type's name refers to the core material around which metal wire is wrapped to create the string. Most beginners should go with synthetic core strings, such as nylon core.
The bow should be new, or newly re-haired. You can check this by looking at the hair of the bow (the fine, white or off-white fibers) and ensuring that the color is uniform and bright along its entire length. The hair of the bow should be a uniform width from end to end.

Bows wear down over time. You can get your bow re-haired for a small fee at most music shops.



, Nearly all violinists use a chin rest, which is a cheap, ergonomic piece of (usually black) plastic that clamps near the base of the violin and allows it to be held securely by your chin. This is usually attached to the violin when the violin is built. Aside from that, be sure you have some rosin (coagulated sap) for your bow, a music stand, and a book of beginner lessons or songs, preferably in a format that will open flat.


Some violinists, especially beginners, also purchase a shoulder rest, which is a violin-width pad that sits on your shoulder underneath the violin and makes it easier to hold. Many people start with a shoulder rest and eventually remove it after a few years. If the violin seems to dig into your shoulder when you play, consider purchasing one.
Fiddlers, if they sing while performing, often hold the violin in the crook of an arm while playing, with the butt resting against their shoulder. For them, chin rests and shoulder rests are generally pointless.

, Once you've set up your music stand and sheet music, open the case and remove the bow. The hair of the bow should be limp. Tighten the bow hair by turning the end screw clockwise until the space between the hair and the stick is big enough to pass a pencil through cleanly from tip to tip.


The hair shouldn't be too limp, or too tight. The hair should not be parallel to the wooden part of the bow, but with the wooden part curving slightly toward the hair.
Don't use your pinky finger as a gauge because the oil from your skin will transfer to the hair, which needs to remain oil-free to get the best sound from the strings.

, Rosin comes in two types, dark and light; either is fine to use, and neither is expensive. In warmer climates, light is preferred, dark is recommended in more northern areas. If you live in an unpredictable climate, it is advisable to have both. It's usually a rectangle of hard, translucent material in a paper or cardboard casing that's open on two sides. Grip the rosin by the papered sides and gently but vigorously rub it up and down along the length of the bow hair three or four times. The goal is to transfer some of the rosin “dust” onto the hair, making it stickier. You will need to rosin your bow about every time you practice.


If you don't think the rosin is producing any ""dust"", take a key, sandpaper, a coin, or any other sharp object, and lightly scratch the rosin. You will see some light streaks if you scratched hard enough.
Too much rosin will cause the bow to grip too well, producing a scratchy sound. If you over-rosin your bow, it's fine; it'll just take a few hours of playing to bring it back down to the correct level.
If this is a newly haired bow, it may need more rosin than normal. Draw the flat side of the bow hair across a string to see if it makes a clear sound after three or four strokes of rosin. If it doesn't, add a couple more.

, Set the bow aside for a moment and take the violin out of the case. The strings, in order from lowest tone to highest, should be tuned to G, D, A, and E. You can usually purchase an electric tuner from $15 to $20 dollars depending on the quality and brand. Major adjustments can be made with the tuning pegs in the scroll of the violin, but if the tone seems only a little bit off, use the tiny metal dials near the bottom, called fine tuners, to make your adjustments instead. Once you're satisfied, return the violin to the open case for a moment. You probably would like to have a professional tune your violin first.

Here's a mnemonic to remember the tuning order from lowest to highest:Good Dogs Always Eat

Rely on a tone whistle to find the correct notes, or simply look sound files up on the Internet.
Not all violins have fine tuners, but they can be installed by a shop. Some violins may have only one fine tuner, on the E string. Some violinists can make do with just that one fine tuner, while others may prefer to get the rest.

, Use the balance point to learn to hold the bow and even out the weight. When you think you are ready to grip the bow like a professional, start by gently laying the middle part of your index finger on the grip (the slightly padded part of the stick, usually a few inches above the tightening knob). Place the tip of your pinky on the flat part of the stick near the base, keeping it slightly curved. The ring and middle fingers should rest with their middle parts in line with the tip of your pinky, and their tips on the side of the frog (the black piece that connects the tightening knob to the hair). Your thumb should rest underneath the stick, at the front of the frog, near or on the bow hair.


It might feel a bit uncomfortable at first, but over time, it will form into a habit.
Your hand should be relaxed and loose, and somewhat rounded as if holding a small ball. Don't let your palm close or rest on the bow. This reduces the control you have over the movement of the bow, which becomes increasingly important as your skill increases.

, Stand or sit with a straight back. Pick it up by its neck with your left hand and bring the butt of the instrument up to your neck. Rest the lower back of the violin on your collar bone and hold it in place with your jaw. To learn notes, however, you should hold it guitar style and buy a music book. It helps a whole lot.


Your jaw, just under the earlobe (not your chin), is supposed to be resting on the chin rest. This helps prevent the instrument from sliding off your shoulder. (This is also why violinists on TV always seem to be looking down and to the right.

, Place your hand under the top part of the neck and support the violin so that the scroll is pointing out away from you. Hold it steady by resting the side of your thumb on the neck, and allow your four fingers to arch over the fingerboard, which is the black plate covering the front of the neck.


Beware of the ""wimpy wrist"" where your left wrist is touching the fingerboard. This, too, could turn into a habit if you don't fix it.
As a beginner, your hand should be as far up the neck as possible while still allowing your pointer finger to come down on the fingerboard. Eventually, you'll learn to slide your hand up and down to reach higher notes quickly.

, Place the flat side of the bow hair approximately halfway between the bridge (the flimsy-looking wooden stand 3/4 of the way down the strings that keeps them tented) and the fingerboard, so that it's directly over the belly (front body) of the violin. Pull the bow along the string as straight as you can, parallel to the bridge, applying a small amount of pressure. A sound should emanate from the violin. Also, tilt the bow hair towards bridge at a 45-degree angle.


More pressure equals louder sound, but too much pressure makes it scratchy. Light pressure should produce a continuous tone from end to end of the bow; if there are gaps, the bow needs more rosin.
If you play too close to the bridge, it may also sound scratchy.
Tilt the bow slightly toward the scroll and your tone will be more focused, producing a more professional sound.

, Open strings are simply strings played without fingertips on them. Rest the neck of the violin in the space between the left thumb and first finger. Hold the bow with your wrist, elbow, shoulder and contact point on the string within one plane. Change strings by raising or lowering the elbow to bring the bow to the proper height. Try short strokes of 6 inches (15.2 cm) or so in the middle of the bow at first, then try half strokes from the frog to the middle and back again. Work your way up to full-length strokes.


Short and long strokes are both important techniques for playing the violin, so don't feel as though you're wasting time practicing with short strokes.
Continue practicing until you can play one string at a time without touching the other strings. It's important to develop control so you don't accidentally play a note you didn't want to play.

, It takes a lot of practice to master the pressure and positioning required to get your fingers to produce clear notes on the fingerboard. Start with your strongest finger, the pointer finger. Using the tip only, press down firmly on the highest string (the E string). You don't need to use as much pressure as you do with guitar strings; a modest but firm amount is enough. Draw the bow across the E string to produce a slightly higher note. If you are holding the violin properly, your finger should naturally come down about half an inch below the nut (the top of the fingerboard), producing an F note.


Add notes. Once you're able to produce a clear note, try putting the tip of your middle finger down a little ways below the pointer finger on the fingerboard. Keep both fingers down and play another, higher note. Finally, set the ring finger ahead of the middle finger and repeat the process. The pinkie is also used, but takes considerably more practice to master. For now, just worry about the other three fingers.
Add strings. Try playing four notes (open, pointer, middle, and ring) on all four strings. Pay attention to the amount of pressure you need to produce a clear note on each one.

, A scale is a series of notes that ascend and descend in a pattern of steps (usually 8, sometimes 5) that starts at one note and ends at a higher or lower version of the same note. An easy (and useful) scale for beginners is the D Major scale, which starts on the open D string. From there, place your fingers down in order (as described above) and play each note: D (open), E, F sharp, G (which should be produced by your third, or ring, finger). To complete the scale, play the next highest open string, A, and then repeat the pattern on the A string to play B, C sharp, and finally D with your third finger.


When properly played, the D Major scale (and in fact, every major scale) should match the sound of the famous “Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La, Ti, Do” singing scale. If you don't know what that is, look it up online or watch the musical film “The Sound of Music,” which features a memorable and well-known song called “Do Re Mi” that explains it.
If you can't seem to get the sound right, remember: place the first finger a finger's width from the nut, the second finger a finger's width from the first, and the third finger touching the second. If you prefer, ask your music shop or teacher to tape the finger positions for you with white tape, so you have a visual guide.
Other scales, such as minor, harmonic, and even pentatonic (5-note) scales exist, but those can be studied, practiced, and internalized later.

, Start with a short time (15 or 20 minutes) and work a little longer every day until you reach an hour, or you can't find any more time to play. Serious violinists often practice for 3 or more hours per day; then again, many violinists at that level get money for playing. Practice as much as you reasonably can, and keep at it. Even sounding good enough to play a few simple songs can take months, but eventually, things will begin to come together.

Remove each string and replace it individually.,
Orient the new string properly.,
Insert the string through the tuning peg.,
Seat the string at the base.,
Start tightening the string by turning the peg.,
Straighten the string and let it rest.",How to Put Strings on a Violin1," To keep the violin's bridge adjusted properly and to keep the tension from slackening too much, it's important to change each string individually, rather than taking all the strings off at once and replacing them, as is common on guitars and some other stringed instruments. If you've broken a string, put a new one on before removing the others. To remove old strings:


Twist the large tuning pegs toward you, so the string becomes loose.
If you have fine tuners, remove the small metal ball attached to the strings from the tuners. If not, pull the string in the tailpiece toward you and pull up to release the string.
Continue twisting the large tuners until the string is completely loose, and remove it from the tuning peg.;
, Remove the appropriate string from the package and find the tip of the string, which should be inserted into the tuning peg, and the bottom of the string, which should anchor the string in the fine tuner.


The top will typically be colored on the end to distinguish it from the other strings, and the bottom should have a small metal ball on the end to seat it in the fine tuner. The color depends upon the particular brand of strings you purchase.

, Holding the violin with the chin-rest facing you, find the correct tuning peg to orient yourself and locate the tiny hole in it. This should be inside the scroll. Insert the top of the string through the hole, far enough that about half an inch hangs out on the other side.


On almost every violin, the tuning pegs should be oriented in the same way. Make sure you insert the string into the correct peg:

G string on the bottom left
D string on the top left
A string on the top right
E string on the bottom right



, If you have fine tuners, place the small metal ball in the appropriate slot. It sometimes has a tendency to pop out while you're tuning, so check with your thumb regularly while you're tightening the string to make sure the base is still seated in the fine-tuner snugly.

, Turn the large tuner away from you, so the string wraps itself around the peg, tightening and taking up some of the slack. It can be kind of a balancing act, because you want to make sure the base of the string stays seated (pop it back in if it pops out) and make sure that the string wraps around the top peg as straight as possible, which will make it easier to tune.


To keep the string wrapping straight, use one hand to turn the peg and the other hand to pull the string back away from the violin, so it stays tight against the peg. Make sure it wraps around the half-inch sticking through the other side, to hold it in place as you turn.

, Make sure the string is in the appropriate notch in the bridge and continue tightening the string until all the slack is run out. It takes a while for a new string to settle in, so don't waste time fine-tuning until you've let the violin sit, sometimes for as much as several hours, before tuning it closely. Get it in the neighborhood and let the violin adjust to the new string.

Put on all the new strings and leave them slack.,
Place the bridge.,
Use the f-holes to align the bridge.,
Let the violin rest.,
After a rest period, pull on the strings to stretch them.",How to Put Strings on a Violin2," If you're putting strings on a new violin for the first time, you'll have to seat the bridge, which takes some care and measurement. The first step, though, is to put all the new strings on and leave them slack enough to slide the bridge under them and stand upright. Following the basic method for changing a string, letting them stay somewhat looser than you normally might.

, Hold the bridge facing down, and place it under the strings. After that, line the strings in the appropriate crevices are push the bridge up, into standing position, securing the strings into the notches before adjusting the bridge.


The back of the bridge, facing the tailpiece, should be perfectly perpendicular to the violin. Lots of bridges will be stamped with manufacturing information, which indicates the flat side that should face the tail. The other side should have a slight but noticeable slope.
The D string (second to the left, second thickest string) should be on the taller side of the bridge; the A (third to the left, second thinnest string) should rest on the slightly lower.

, The bridge should be horizontally centered on the instrument so that there is an equal amount of space between each string and the edge of the fingerboard. Use the small nicks on the insides of the f-holes to square the bridge to the center-line of the strings.


To center the bridge, use the curve of the ""f"" on the interior side as a guide. It should align equidistant between them.

, You can tighten the strings somewhat to reduce the rest of the slack when you've positioned the bridge, but let it rest for at least 24 hours before attempting to fine-tune the instrument. It's possible to snap the bridge and ruin all your hard work, and also to pop it out and flatten it against the violin. Let it rest and settle.

, When you've first strung any stringed instrument, it's common for the strings to periodically slacken and go quickly flat. A common exercise to get the tension correct and let the strings settle is to firmly but gently pull the strings away from the neck of the violin, pulling out that slack to flatten the strings, and then tuning them again.


It'll likely take several tunings before you can get the violin into a reliable tune. Stick with it and give the violin the appropriate amount of time to relax.

Experiment with different gauges.,
Consider steel core strings.,
Take the next step with rope core steel.,
Go old-school with gut strings.,
Step into the future with synthetic strings.,
Think about your high E. Most players will put the variety of string on the instrument, while some experienced players like to use particular strings in the E slot for tonal reasons.",How to Put Strings on a Violin3," You can buy strings in a variety of thicknesses, tensions, and styles. Experiment some with different sizes to get a sense of what sounds best with your particular style of playing and your wishes for your sound.


Thicker strings put out more volume, resonating with a thicker vibration, while thinner strings tend to be brighter and sunnier. Try a set of each and see what you like.

, The most basic form of strings used on violins are made of steel alloy, often wrapped in nickel. The higher E string is usually plated with some other metal. They tend to have less stretch and durability than other strings, but are by far the cheapest and most widely available strings you can buy. They're most recommended for beginners and if you're changing a string for the first time.

, With a warm sound a quick response, the next step up in the market is rope core steel, which is similar to steel core strings, but braided from more material, giving the player a bright, clear attack on the strings. These strings are commonly used by fiddle players., It doesn't get any more visceral than this: gut strings are made of the intestinal tissue of sheep or lambs. While somewhat gross, these strings feature an incomparably warm and lively sound. Gut strings are somewhat fussy, requiring lots of tuning adjustment. They're greatly affected by weather and temperature as well, making them more useful for very experienced players. Combine with a traditional horse-hair bow and you'll be playing with the same basic ingredients as the old masters.

, Since playing on the colon of a dead animal isn't everyone's bag, manufacturers went about the business of replicating the sound and response of gut strings, but with a much less fussy and reliable. They're also somewhat expensive., Violin companies Hill and Westminster make E strings available separately from their respective sets and are popular inexpensive choices to experiment with.

Listen to as many recordings as you can find.,

Notice that the opening section is repetitious.,

Practice the octave passages carefully.,
Perfect the prestissimo in the second movement by using a metronome and tearing each measure apart.,
Notice that in the third movement it is important for the grace notes to be heard in the right hand.,
Take care about the rhythm in the ending passage (the measures where the piano starts with the 8th rest).",How to Play the Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 1," Be prepared to gain insight on the style of playing. Don't feel as if you are copying the way professionals play this piece - you will inevitably play passages similar to how they play them. Note: If you do this frequently, you may depend on this method, in other words, playing by ear. This is not professional and is looked down on.;
, (That's right. Do it before you even lay your hands on the keys.) This is very easy to do. Just listen to it and think about how it sounds.

, Learn how to place your hands correctly and learn about the chords you are playing. Once you can play the notes, moving your hands one octave up becomes easier.

, As with any piece, you must play so the melody is obvious to the audience.

, Take advantage of this. Put some meaning into the main theme (when this applies)!!!!

, This means not using 5th fingers on each hand during practice. Steady hand motion will result in perfect octave performance (i.e., the 5th fingers will follow the 1st fingers if the 1st and only the 1st fingers on each hand are practiced). DO NOT practice these at full speed. Your arms will surely become tense very quickly. Practice with a metronome with the notes on the 1st fingers initially. One word for the entire second movement (excluding the prestissimo): dolce!

, This can be very challenging to play at full speed and there is a lot of room for error. Don't practice the dynamics when learning the notes in this section. It will delay your progress. When you can play this part to tempo, incorporate the dynamics.

, Again, hands separately. It will be important to practice your scales and thirds in both hands while preparing to play the third movement since there are a few pages of continuous runs in both hands. It is extremely important to practice these very slowly until you can play them absolutely perfectly. Practicing the runs with both hands simultaneously may be beneficial here.

, Buying the Music Minus One disc should help you find out when to come in and practice good timing and flexibility. Be sure to apply your own style of playing here!

Practice.,
Listen.,
Pay attention to the little things.,
Play through it slowly.,
Slowly increase speed.",How to Play the Solfeggietto on Piano,"  As with anything, practice is the key.  Practice often - even if you only have time to play it through once, that one time will help.
,  Look up the piece online, and listen to someone professional playing the piece.  Listen to it over and over again.  This will help you by letting you hear what it's supposed to sound like. You will get a better understanding of the music.

If you listen to several recordings, you will find that different people render the piece slightly differently.  That's their style.  Some people cannot play as fast as others.  That's okay.  Just do the best you can while doing C. P. E. Bach justice.

,  Read the details in the music.

Tempo.  The tempo is marked as ""prestissimo"". That literally means ""as fast as possible"".  Obviously, you will have to work up to that, but it is important to know ahead of time.
Dynamics.  The volume of the piece is extremely important.  You don't want to pound.  Pounding is obnoxious, and it will slow your fingers down.  A light hand moves faster.  Don't play too softly either.  Make sure the sound varies.  In this piece, the music can be forte (loud) for one measure, and then instantly change to piano (soft) in the next.  These dramatic changes are what make the piece.
Pedal.  Less is more  Keep your foot light.  Don't hold the damper down forever - that muddles the notes.  Bounce up often, but don't allow the piece to sound choppy.  The music has to flow.
Fingering.  When your fingers need to hit this many notes, you have to have your fingers at the right place at the right time.  If the music says that your fourth finger needs to be on E-flat then make sure it's there.  This is something you will have to watch closely and practice slowly until you've trained your hands to automatically do the right thing.

,  You will never get all the notes in, you will never master the piece unless you practice the song through in slow mode.  It may seem boring, but it's essential!  This helps you get each note, keep an even tempo, have accurate fingering, and put in dynamics.,  Once you get the piece down in slow-mode, begin to speed it up little by little.  As you master each speed, make it a little bit faster.  It will take time, but eventually you will be able to let your fingers fly over the notes.  Soon, you will be playing the fastest you possibly can."

Always place your fingers on the keys before you play them.,
Either lift the finger from the key (while keeping contact with the keys with the other ones,) and let it drop on the key, or use *slight* arm pressure, with very relaxed fingers to press the keys.

,
After the key has been pressed, slide the fingers to the right or left.,
In places where the fingers need to go far (i.e.",How to Play the Piano to Amateur Concert Level Status," That way you will always know that you're hitting the correct key. (You don't have time to look at them all when you're playing fast.) It will also ensure that you don't hit the keys too hard, which you should never do.;
,, The fingers should not stick, but glide across the keys. That way you don't lose contact with the ivory (as Josef Hofmann said,) and you don't need to look at the keys again to re-set your hands in the proper place.

, 2-3 octaves,) you may need to look at the keys to see where they're at, but still, you must touch the keys first before playing them. This ensures accuracy (very important at high speeds,) a soft touch (very important for expression, and not hammering the keys,) and very little effort or work to do for your fingers, which makes it easy to play long, fast passages without errors, and without fatigue.

, It may look confusing at first but here are a couple things that will make it easier.


There are only 12 basic notes. Every set of 12 notes is the same as every other set of 12 notes, only higher in pitch, or lower in pitch.
Every single white key is part of the C Major scale.
Every single black key is either called a “sharp” (#) or a “flat”(b).

, Notice the pattern, starting from the C on the left side of the picture. It has a tab pointing to the right. The next note, D, has little tabs on each side, and the next note, E, has a tab to the left.


Notice the pattern of 2 white keys bracketing 2 black keys and a white key in the middle.
Notice the next group up has the same type of grouping, only with 3 black keys and 2 white keys in the middle, between the notes F and B.

, Notice that the same pattern is there. This is the same for every octave on the keyboard.

, This is Middle C, or C3. The C notes above it are C4, C5, C6, etc. The C notes below it are known as C2, C1, C0.

, Yes, that’s right. It’s that easy! Start on C3, imagine yourself walking normally, and for every step you imagine, play the next white key up, until you reach C4—then stop. Okay, it’s not much of a song, but all the basics were there—playing specific notes in a specific order for a specific amount of time. This is what you played looks like on sheet music:


Play it again. Just like before, imagine yourself walking, and for each step, play the next note up the keyboard. This time, look at each note, reading from left to right, before you play it on the keyboard. Now you're not only playing a song, you're reading music!

, There are a couple basic ways to learn how to play the keyboard or piano.



Learn to read music. You can teach yourself this invaluable skill, you can take lessons, or you can do both. It's a great skill to learn, and it's a skill you can take with you should you wish to learn to sing, play the bassoon, the guitar, or the saxophone.
Learn by ear. In some ways, this is easier. You just listen to a song, and then figure out which keys on the keyboard make the same notes. It's hard at first, but with a little ear training it gets easier. Plus, you don't have to be bothered with learning what all those little black dots mean.

, Go to your local music store, and explain to them that you are just learning to play the keyboard, what style of music you want to play, and if they can recommend a good book for beginners. They will be able to recommend the right method for your style of learning.


They might also recommend a piano teacher. If you want to become a skilled player, take their advice.
When first positioning your fingers, be aware that some sheet music has little numbers to help guide you. These numbers represent your finger placement for the notes on the score. These correspond to: 1=thumb, 2=index finger, 3=middle finger, 4=ring finger, and 5=little finger.

, No method of learning is instant, and learning by ear is no different. Remembering the sound of a song and finding which notes on the keyboard to press is a skill that takes some practice to develop. The good news is that every great improviser in the world knows how to do it, so it's a skill that will never be wasted. Here is how you can start.

, It's pronounced ""soul-fezh,"" and it means sight singing. You already know the basics, if you know how to sing ""do re mi."" The notes of the basic solfège scale are as follows: do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti, do. In the key of C (the white keys), this corresponds to C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C.

, On your keyboard, play the C scale we covered above. For each note you play, sing the next note in the solfège scale. Don't worry if your singing won't get you on American Idol. The idea is to connect the sounds with the notes. But what about the black notes?


Here is the scale, including the black notes in italics: do-di-re-ri-mi-fa-fi-sol-si-la-li-ti-do. Try that on your keyboard now, and see how it sounds. You'll notice that the do-re-mi parts are starting to sound familiar.

, Instead of just singing ""do re mi,"" try singing them in little jumps: ""do-mi-re-fa-mi-sol-do."" Make up your own combinations, write them down, and sing them. Then match them to the keyboard, and see if you were close.

, It may be a song you already know well, or a children's song that's very familiar. Only this time, instead of singing, for example, ""Mary had a little lamb,"" sing ""mi-re-do-re-mi-mi-miiiiiiiii.""


When you develop the ability to do this, you can learn the solfège words to any song, anywhere you might be, and then when you get back to your keyboard, play them back.
The more you do this, the better you'll get.

, Each of these brains has a type of memory.

, These are sounds like pianos, strings, flute, or new and unusual sounds that you can create yourself.

, This section might be called ""rhythms"" on some keyboards, or ""styles"" on others. The keyboard may include drum kits, bass guitars, pianos and other combinations using preset patterns. It's like a backing band you control with your left hand, and with your right hand, you play the melody.

, For instance, if you played a left hand bass guitar part, you could record that, save it, and later play accompaniment with that. You could then play something entirely new, like a piano or synthesizer melody, to fit together with what you've originally recorded.

, Consider the following factors.

, It's big, it's heavy, and it's loud. And you can't plug in headphones to your piano to practice at 2 in the morning!

, A digital piano is comparable to a piano, but remember, the process by which a digital piano is sampled from a real piano causes a small loss in sound quality.

, Next time you're near a piano, press down on the lowest note. Then press down on the highest note. Feel the difference? It's heavy and firm on the lower end, and light and easy on the higher end.


Now try the same thing on most keyboards. Unless they're made to emulate a piano keyboard, the keys on a synthesizer or workstation all feel the same. The ""action,"" as it's called, is very light and fast, and much easier on the hands to play for long hours.
Many keyboard players do not need the full range of the piano. The notes you're playing can be moved up and down the keyboard electronically. For example, the note that is currently at middle C—C3, can become C4, or C1, or any other octave at the touch of a button.

, It's also more practical if you are playing in a band. Rhythm guitarist late for band practice? The keyboard player can call up a guitar sound patch or take the rhythm guitarist's role in the band by playing chords in the background with a piano patch.

, Whether you want to be a concert pianist or the keyboard whiz in a rock band, the basics are the same.

, The instrument has many names and variations that all use the same interface. Let’s take a non-comprehensive look at the history of the keyboard.


Organ. This would be among the earliest keyboard instruments with some of the earliest being played with one hand while the other hand operated the bellows.
Harpsichord. These were some of the earliest keyboards, and made their sounds by plucking the string like a guitarist would do, only the plectrum was attached to the key. The resulting sound had little dynamic range, but the dynamics were mainly achieved using stops which added or subtracted the number (choirs) of strings on the larger instruments. When the harpsichord was played as usual, it wasn't too noticeable that the instrument wasn't capable of sustaining any note for long.
Piano. This refined the process of making sounds, using a hard-felt hammer rather than a pick. The hammer was activated by the keyboard, and the pianist was given control of full range of dynamics, from very soft to very loud.
Electric Piano. While a piano sounds incredibly rich and beautiful, it’s really hard to carry around to a gig. When musicians started plugging in back in the 50s, they wanted something at least as portable as a drum kit. The electric piano (and organ) were born.
Synthesizer. After 300 years of harpsichords and pianos, musicians were very familiar and comfortable with the layout of the keyboard. When electronic sound synthesizers came along, it made sense to use the same key layout, but there was a subtle shift in terminology. Until then, people who played the keyboard were generally called “pianists” or “organists.” However, for an instrument that has a keyboard like a piano, but can sound like anything from a symphony orchestra to singing kittens, the word “pianist” just didn’t fit any longer, and the keyboard player was born.

Make sure to spend some time messing around with a few of them so you can find one that you like and are comfortable with.


The advantage of online virtual instrument applications is that there is no need to download or install any additional software programs.
To find virtual piano applications, search the Internet for ""virtual piano keyboard"" or ""play piano online."";
, The first thing you need to do is experiment a little with the virtual piano you’ve chosen. Feel free to play it a little, hit random keys, or otherwise just mess around. Remember that:


The virtual piano keys on the screen usually correspond to the keys on your computer keyboard. See if the app has a guide to your keyboard so you can find out which of your keyboard keys trigger the piano keys.
If you have a touch screen, you’ll be able to just touch the screen to play.
If you want, use your mouse to touch the piano and to play some notes., After experimenting a little, you should take the time to really get to know your keyboard and the specific online piano application. By doing this, you’ll be able to discover features and gain more familiarity with the app.


Notice that the keyboard is broken up into two colors, black and white.
Identifying and using the black and white keys will form the basis of playing an online piano., Identifying the groups of keys will help you learn how to play the piano and eventually play whole songs. Remember that:


Black keys in groups of two are C sharp and D sharp (or D flat and E flat).
The three white keys around groups of two black keys are C, D, and E.
Black keys in groups of three are F sharp, G sharp, and A sharp (or G flat, A flat, and B flat).
White keys around groups of three black keys are F, G, A, B, and C., Different keys are associated with different notes and make different sounds. Knowing which keys make which sounds will help you play and compose music.


Touch the white keys. The white keys represent different notes in an octave.
Use the black keys. The black keys represent half steps between the notes played by white keys., After you’ve familiarized yourself with your black and white keys, you should begin playing them together. By playing them together, you’ll get a hang of the sounds the online piano creates. You’ll begin to grow more comfortable with the online piano over time.


Experiment with different combinations of notes.
Use or create chords with hot keys or macros. Many online pianos have the option to use pre-programmed chords or to design your own with hot keys. Check to see if the application you’ve chosen has this feature., Your goal in learning to play the piano online should be to play a song on your own. Make sure to use all of the information you’ve gathered to slowly learn a song of your choice.


Pick a song that is simple, like “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.”
Print off sheet music, if that will help. Use what you learned about the black and white keys and the notes they represent.
Spend an hour a day or so practicing it until you’ve got it perfected.

, Many online piano applications allow users to adjust the sound of the virtual instrument to mimic a variety of different instruments or other sounds. By experimenting with these features, you’ll see that an online piano has a lot to offer in terms of creating innovative new sounds and music.


Add an accompaniment or a drum track or other instrument.
Some online piano websites include pre-programmed accompaniments that you can play along with., Changing the octave of the piano keyboard will alter the sounds of the music it produces. By changing the octave, you’ll take your piano playing to the next level and take advantage of the full abilities of an online piano.


The virtual piano keyboard usually consists of only 8 keys, or a single octave. However, many online piano playing sites provide the option of changing to a higher or lower octave.
Change the octave settings on the virtual piano keyboard to access the full range of notes found on a real piano keyboard., Many online piano apps have a feature that will teach you to play a particular song. Use this feature to learn a pre-programmed song.


Some virtual piano web applications can teach users how to play a specific song.
Typically, the keys on the virtual keyboard will light up to signal when a note should be played.

Diminished Chords: Like all chords, diminished chords and diminished 7th chords are formed from the intervals of the major scale, which is.,
A diminished chord is the root, the flatted third, and the flatted fifth.,
Diminished 7th Chords: The notes in a diminished 7th chord are the same as those in a diminished chord, the root, flatted third and flatted fifth.,
There are only three Diminished 7th chords: Each ascending note in a diminished seventh chord is the minor third (a whole step followed by a half step) of the one preceding it.,
Every diminished seventh chord is really four chords, containing four evenly spaced notes each.,
The C, Eb/D#, Gb/F# & A (Bbb) diminished seventh chords all contain exactly the same notes.

,
The C#/Db, E, G, & Bb (Cbb) diminished seventh chords all contain exactly the same notes.,
The D, F, Ab/G# & B (Cb) diminished seventh chords all contain exactly the same notes.

",How to Play Diminished Piano Chords," (Root, whole step, whole step, half step, whole step, whole step, whole step, half step.) For purposes of this example, let's use the “C” scale, which is: C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C.;
, So the notes in a C diminished chord are: C, Eb, & Gb. (It is like a C minor, {C, Eb, & G} with the fifth, G, also flatted.) A C diminished chord would typically be denoted either: C dim, C Dim and occasionally as C-.

, (C dim = C, Eb, Gb) Then the doubly flatted seventh is added; Bbb. Yes a double flatted seventh is the same note as the sixth, so a Bbb is also an A. —However, since the chord is called a diminished seventh, the seventh tone of the scale must be present and “A” is the sixth tone of the “C” scale, not the seventh. To be any type of seventh chord, the seventh tone of the scale must be present in some form. Therefore, to be theoretically correct, the note must be called a “B” double flat, —not an “A”. So, the notes in a C dim7 chord are: C, Eb, Gb, & Bbb.

, (Up a minor third from C is Eb, up another minor third is Gb and up another minor third is Bbb (which is also A) So, C dim7 is one chord, C# dim7 or Db dim 7 is the second chord, and D dim7 is the third chord, - - - and when you reach Eb dim7 / D# dim7, you will be playing the same note that are in a C dim7. (Eb, Gb, Bbb {also known as A} and Dbb {also known as C})

, Since only twelve notes and their octaves exist and since 12 ÷ 4 = 3, there are only three diminished chords possible before you are playing a different inversion of the same chord again.

Learn the basic chords.,
Learn the right hand placement.,
Understand the structure of the song.,
Get the right feel.",How to Play Piano Man1," While it takes technique and rhythm to play the song the way it is meant to be played, you've got to start by learning the basic chords.There are a few basic chord patterns, the Intro, the verse/chorus, the little riff that he uses to transition between the instrumental parts and singing, and the bridge.



The chords to the Intro are:

D minor 7
D diminished 7



The chords to the verse/chorus are:

C major
C diminished/B
A minor
A minor/B
F major
D minor/F#
G major 7



The chords to the transition riff are:

C major
F major
C major 7
G major



The bridge chords (where he sings ""la la la"") are:

A minor
A minor/G
D major/F#
F major
G major

;
, In this song, the chords are mostly played with the right hand while the left hand follows them in a basic bass descending bass accompaniment (marked above with the note after the ""/"". Throughout the singing part, play the chord with your right hand and follow along providing bass with your left about an octave down. The bridge is the same.A big part of the song is the descending bassline, which moves the song forward. In the verse, for instance, the right hand will basically hand on the C chord position, but the bass will descend from C to B (""Play me a song…""). Listen to the song to get the timing right and practice some to get the right bass notes.
The Intro lick and the riff between the verses is chorded with the left hand and while the right hand plays melodic flourishes on the basic chord.

, When you've got the chords down, playing the song itself isn't too complicated. The song features several short verses of four lines each, and features the distinctive harmonica break between some of them. Before each chorus (""Sing us a song, you're the piano man…"") he plays the bridge chord sequence to build up the dynamics, and after each chorus, he plays the harmonica break and the transition chord sequence. The most complicated part is that some of the verses involve more 4-line sections than others, and he also varies the pattern some, so it takes some practice to get the whole thing right. The basic structure of the song is as follows:


Intro riff / Verse / Harmonica Break / Verse / Bridge
Chorus / Harmonica Break / Transition
Verse / Verse / Bridge / Verse / Harmonica Break / Verse / Piano Solo
Chorus / Harmonica Break / Transition
Verse / Verse / Bridge
Chorus / Harmonica Break / Transition

, The song is a bar-room ballad in 3/4, which means it should be played as a wistful waltz. It should also be played loosely, like a drinking song that might be hammered out on an out-of-tune piano in the corner of a smoky bar.


Practice with a light touch on the keys, listening closely to get the right dynamic shifts that Joel uses in his version. The verses are basically played straight, without many right-hand frills, following the descending bassline and the right-hand chords, while the Intro fill, which repeats periodically throughout the song, is more dynamic.
Listen to the song repeatedly to get a sense of the nuances. Even sheet music can't quite capture the feel of the song and the little licks Joel throws in to improvise. The feeling of the song is more important than getting all the notes right.

Get a C harp.,
Get a harp rack.,
Put your lips to the harmonica correctly.,
Play the melody during the harmonica break.",How to Play Piano Man2," If you want to really kick your performance of the song into high gear, you've got to strap on a harmonica. And you can't just play any song on any old harmonica. Make sure you get a harmonica in the key of C or it'll sound off.


In general, most starter harps that you get will be in this key, so play along to a song you know is in C and see if it sounds right to check whether or not you've got the right kind of harp. Marine Band harmonicas can be upward of $30, but are durable and have a high-quality sound, while other cheaper started harps can be much less.

, Following in the footsteps of Joel, Neil Young, and Bob Dylan, put your harmonica in a harp rack around your neck to free-up your hands to play piano and harmonica at the same time to complete the song. Typically, harp racks are available at guitar stores and other music stores and only cost a few bucks. They're cool tools to have on hand to add a little harmonica color to your songs.

, Purse your lips together as if you were going to whistle, and place them on the center-most hole of the harmonica's keyholes, which should be the fifth from the left. By blowing through (exhaling) this hole only, you will create the note ""E.""


Experiment a bit to learn how to make different sounds on the harmonica. By inhaling through this or any keyhole, you will create a sound one note higher than the blown note. The notes follow standard piano formation, meaning the blown notes to the right of the E are, in order; G, C, E, G, and C, while the inhaled notes are F, A, B, D, F, and A.

, Billy Joel would be the first one to tell you that it doesn't take a rocket scientist to play the harmonica part. Since the harp's in C, you won't be able to really blow a bad note, so it's mostly about experimenting with blowing and inhaling in the proper positions to get the melody close.


Basically, you'll play E, G, E, C, alternating sucking in and blowing out. Listen to the song and you'll be able to get it after a few tries.

Note the number of strings.,
Examine the position of the strings.",How to Tune a Dulcimer1," Dulcimers can have anywhere from 3 to 12 strings, but the vast majority have three, four, or five strings.The tuning process is fairly similar for these common dulcimers, but there are a few differences worth noting.


A three-string dulcimer has one bass string, one middle string, and one melody string.
A four-string dulcimer has one bass string, one middle string, and two melody strings.
A five-string dulcimer has two bass strings, one middle string, and two melody strings.
When there is a set of strings (two bass strings or two melody strings), all strings in that set should be tuned in the same manner.
If you have a dulcimer with more than five strings, you should take it to a professional to have it tuned since there are too many variations in string placement and sound.

, Before you can tune a string, you need to know which knob adjusts which string and where each string lies.


When the front of the dulcimer faces you, the knob or knobs on the left are usually your middle strings. The lower knob on the right is usually the bass, and the upper knob on the right is usually your melody.
If in doubt, adjust the knobs carefully and observe which string is tightened or loosened as you make the adjustment. If you are still unable to determine which knob adjusts which string, ask an expert to help you.
Note that the bass string is usually referred to as the ""third"" string even though you will tune it first. Similarly, the melody string is usually referred to as the ""first"" string even though you work on it last. This is because the bass string is the furthest from you and the melody string is the closest to you.

"
"
Tune the bass string to the D below Middle C. Pluck the open string and listen to the sound it produces.,
Adjust the middle string.,
Tune the melody string to the same note as the middle string.",How to Tune a Dulcimer2," Play the correct D note on a guitar, piano, or pitch pipe, then adjust the bass knob until the sound the plucked string produces matches the D note you played.On a guitar, the D below Middle C is the same note as the open fourth string.
If you do not have an instrument to tune the bass string to, hum a note with your voice that feels as natural and comfortable as possible. This may not be a D note, but it will come close enough for most purposes.
Note that the Ionian Mode is the most standard and can also be called the ""natural major"" mode. Most traditional American songs are considered ""natural major"" songs.;
, Press down on the bass string just left of the fourth fret on your dulcimer. Pluck on the string to produce an A note, then use the middle tuning knob to adjust the middle string until the sound it produces matches the same pitch when the middle string is open plucked.This step and the step prior to it are the essentially same no matter which tuning method you use.

, Pluck the melody string. Use its tuning knob to adjust it until the melody string produces the same sound as the open middle string.


This sound is the A note, and it is also the same sound produced when you pluck the bass string after pressing the bass string down to the left of the fourth fret.
The Ionian Mode scale begins on the third fret and runs through the tenth fret. You can play additional notes both below and above this scale on your dulcimer.

If using a guitar, pluck the open fourth string to hear the correct note.
When you do not have a pitch pipe or other instrument to tune this bass string to, you can informally tune the dulcimer by humming a note that feels natural and comfortable. Match the string to the note you hum.
The Mixolydian Mode can also be called the ""slightly minor"" mode. Typically, this mode is heard most often in Neo-Celtic music and songs written for the Irish fiddle.

, Press down on the bass string, positioning your finger a little to the left of the fourth fret. Pluck on the string. The note you produce should be an A note. Use the appropriate tuning knob to adjust the middle string until an open pluck on the middle string matches that A note.


Note that this step and the one before it are identical in each tuning method, so if you master these two steps, you can use just about any tuning method.

, Press the middle string down at the third fret and pluck it to produce a high D. Adjust the melody string using its tuning knob until plucking the open melody string produces the same high D sound.


This high D is one octave above the open bass string.
Note that tuning to D-A-D or Mixolydian Mode puts more tension on the melody string.
The Mixolydian Mode scale begins on open melody string (also called the ""zero fret"") and runs through the seventh fret. There are no notes below the octave on your dulcimer, but there are notes above it.

The open fourth string on a guitar will produce the correct D note.
If you do not have a pitch pipe, guitar, or piano, you can tune this bass string using your voice. Hum a note that feels as natural and comfortable as possible and tune the string to that sound. This method of tuning is not as exact, but it will usually produce passable results.
The Dorian mode is more minor than the Mixolydian Mode but less so than the Aeolian Mode. It has been used for a variety of tunes, including Scarborough Fair and Greensleeves.

, Produce an A note with the bass string by pressing it just to the left of the fourth fret. Pluck on the middle string without pressing it, then just the appropriate tuning knob to adjust the middle string until it produces that same A note.


This step and the one immediately before it are the same for each different tuning method described here, so mastering these two steps is a crucial effort.

, Press on the bass string at the third fret and pluck it to produce a G note. Adjust the melody string using its tuning knob until plucking the open melody string produces this same note.


You will need to loosen the tension of the melody string to lower the pitch.
The Dorian Mode scale begins on the fourth fret and runs through the eleventh fret. There are additional notes on the dulcimer below the octave and a few above it.

When using a guitar, play the D below middle C by plucking the open fourth string.
If you do not have an instrument that you can use when tuning this bass string, use your voice. Hum a natural, comfortable note and tune the string to that sound. The results may not be quite as precise, though.
Note that the Aeolian Mode is also called the ""natural minor"" mode. It has a tendency to ""weep"" and ""wail,"" and it works well with many traditional Scottish and Irish songs.

, Produce an A note using the bass string by pressing it down a little to the left of the fourth fret and giving it a pluck. Pluck the open middle string, then adjust it using its tuning knob until you can produce that same A note.


Note that this step and the bass tuning step are essentially the same for each method described in this article.

, Press the bass string at the sixth fret and pluck it to produce a C note. Tune the melody string using the appropriate tuning knob until it produces a sound that matches this C note.


You will usually have to loosen the melody string a little when making this adjustment.

Once you're familiar with your piece, memorize it. Memorize measure by measure or line by line. Even after you've learned and memorized it, continue to practice diligently at slow tempos to fix any new problems that develop.
Practice with the understanding that you won't be able to make changes at the last minute, and your performance will sound much like your practice.;
, If your piano is at home, play for your family and guests. Find pianos in public places and play your piece for passersby.


If you practice in a music school, play for other students. Evaluate each performance for its good and bad moments, and develop a plan for fixing the mistakes.

, Pick out the clothes you'll be wearing and make sure they don't restrict your movement or look awkward when you play. Knowing you look great gives you one less thing to worry about on the day of the recital.

, On the day of the recital, play your piece slowly with the music. Pay attention to troublesome spots, but understand that it's too late to make major changes. Once you've looked over your piece, play something that you love to play, gets you excited about sharing your music with others, or relaxes you.

, If possible, test out the instrument you'll be performing on. Evaluate its soft and loud dynamics, tonal control, relative loudness of the octaves, and pedals. You should arrive early even if you're not able to play on the performance instrument: few things contribute to performance anxiety like arriving to your recital late.

, Be confident in your thorough preparation. The green room is no place to change fingerings or correct memory slips, so reassure yourself that you have it down. If you feel the need, review the score and play the piece in your head, but not more than once.

Position your hand.,
Grip the harp.,
Position it in your mouth.,
Curl your lips.",How to Play the Jew's Harp1," Use your non-dominant hand (right hand for lefties) to grip the Jew’s harp. Make a “C” shape with your thumb and index finger. This will be where you hold the frame of the harp. Align the circular portion of the Jew’s harp with your hand’s “C” shape.


The harp is composed of a circular frame and two long arms that secure the reed.;
, Use a light grip with your thumb and index finger around the frame. Make sure that the trigger is facing away from your face. The trigger is the part of the harp that protrudes from the reed in the center.


If your harp is rounder than your grip, use your middle finger and index finger to grip the shaft. Then hold the frame secure by using your thumb.

, Open your teeth about ⅜” apart and insert the arms of the harp against your teeth. Again, position the harp so the reed’s trigger is facing away from your face. The key is to rest the beveled edge of the harp firmly against your teeth. Do not put your teeth on top of the beveled edge. Press the Jew’s harp firmly against your teeth. It is essential, for the sake of your teeth, that you use firm pressure.If you do not position the harp in the right position, you could chip your tooth.

, To get a good sound out of the harp, the harp must be touching your teeth. The opening must be clear for the reed to produce tones. Curl your lips slightly over your teeth and onto the frame. Be sure to keep the pathway of the trigger clear.

Practice plucking.,
Open your throat.,
Change the shape of your mouth.,
Move your tongue.,
Modify your breathing.,
Practice your repertoire of sounds.,
Play notes on the harp.",How to Play the Jew's Harp2," Use your dominate hand to pluck the trigger lightly. It is essential that you do not use a powerful pluck in the beginning. This is when you’re the most susceptible to chipping a tooth. To avoid damaging your teeth, keep a firm pressure between the harp and your teeth. Pluck the trigger inwards or outwards depending on your preference.









An inward pluck is when the trigger is plucked in the direction of your mouth.
An outer pluck is when the trigger is plucked away from your mouth.Find a comfortable pluck. Some Jew’s harpist use their index finger to pluck while others use their whole hands. Figure out what is comfortable for you. Try plucking a rhythm and repeat that rhythm. This will help you develop your comfortability with plucking.

, To get the most amplified sound out of the Jew’s harp, you must open your throat. It's common to open your throat if you are chugging a liquid. Do this same technique with your throat while playing the Jew’s harp.

, Try modifying the shape of your throat. You do this in everyday speech. Imagine you’re saying the vowels: a, e, i, o and u. These shapes will all give you different tones. Practice a consistent pluck while changing the shape of your mouth.You can reach a higher pitch by widening your mouth. Similarly, you can reach a lower tone by narrowing your mouth.

, Your tongue also plays a part in altering the sound of a Jew’s harp. Experiment with different positions for your tongue. Try flickering your tongue to the back of your throat for a nice effect.







, Different breathing variations will modify your tone. Breathing out while playing will create a loud and buzzy sound. Breathing in will create a softer buzzing sound. Use these techniques as accents. Breathe through your nose during normal play.







, Continue to experiment with different combinations of the above techniques. Once you begin to feel comfortable with different sounds, try to develop a melody out of the Jew’s harp. It will take a lot of practice to play cohesive melodies on the Jew’s harp. 








You won’t be able to play distinct melodies until you’ve mastered all the basics.
Try something experimental on the Jew’s harp. Try whispering words while playing. Play around and try to have fun with it.

, Differentiating notes on purpose is difficult for both players and listeners. The particular note you produce depends on the quality and make of your Jew’s harp. Play notes by playing open and closed sounds. Open sounds are all the sounds you’ve produced thus far. Closed sounds are achieved by closing your throat, or your glottis. Then use air pressure to open your glottis by saying “A.”









This will produce an overtone which is essential for playing different notes.Use a tuner while you are practicing to see if you are able to hit a perfect note. Then practice the other techniques and adjust your mouth till those sounds create a different note.
Again, playing intentional notes is difficult for the Jew’s harp.

Seek out recordings.,
Watch videos.,
Purchase a good Jew’s harp.",How to Play the Jew's Harp3," There are plenty of recordings that feature a Jew’s harp. It is typically used in old time folk and country music, but it is native to eastern European folk music. Listen to these popular recordings featuring a Jew’s harp:

We’re Allowed by The Odd Tones
Bumblebees Can Fly by Gorgon Frazier
Mouthing Off by Wayland Harman, Search through the internet for a wide range of different players with unique styles. Watch the videos with your Jew’s harp in hand to try out new techniques. Videos of other players can inspire you to become a better harpist.

Youtube.com has plenty of videos by pros and amateurs. There are even how to videos that can help improve your sound.

, A common reason for a lack in interest in playing a Jew’s harp is playing a cheap harp. The popular Snoopy’s mouth harps may be cheap and the most accessible, but they don’t sound good. Spend an extra ten dollars on a better Jew’s harp.

Some harps are even sold by the key like A, C or D."

Verify that you have a Greek bouzouki.,
Count the strings.,
Match the strings to the tuning pegs.,
Know the pattern.",How to Tune a Greek Bouzouki1," Before you tune your instrument, make sure that it is actually a Greek-style bouzouki and not an Irish-style bouzouki. The two versions are typically tuned to different patterns, so it's important to know which version you have.


The easiest difference to identify is the shape of the instrument. A Greek bouzouki has a bowl-shaped back, but the back of an Irish bouzouki is flat.
Scale length is another major difference. The Greek bouzouki has a longer scale measuring to 680 mm, while the Irish bouzouki has a scale length around 530 mm., The most traditional Greek bouzoukis have three string courses with two strings each, giving you a total of six strings. Other versions of the Greek bouzouki have four string courses with two strings each, or a total of eight strings.


Six-string bouzoukis are called trichordo models. Eight-string bouzoukis are called tetrachordo models.
Note that most Irish bouzoukis have eight strings, but it is also possible for an Irish version to have six strings.
The modern tetrachordo version is believed to date back to the 1950s, while the trichordo version dates back to ancient times., It should be easy to determine which tuning pegs adjust which string courses, but you should check the instrument before you begin to make the process as effective as possible.


Face the front of the bouzouki.

On the trichordo, the 2 knobs on the lower right adjust the highest-pitched strings. The 2 knobs on the lower left adjust the lowest-pitched strings, leaving the 2 end knobs on each side to adjust the middle strings.
On the tetrachordo, the 2 knobs on the lower right adjust the highest pitched strings, the 2 knobs on the upper right adjust the next lowest strings, the 2 knobs on the upper left adjust the next lowest strings, and the 2 knobs on the lower left adjust the lowest pitched strings.


Each string of a course is attached to it's own tuning peg. You will adjust both strings of a course to the same pitch (or octaves, as is often the case for the lower pitched course or courses).

, Trichordo bouzoukis are usually tuned to the pattern of D-A-D. Tetrachordo bouzoukis are traditionally tuned to the pattern of C-F-A-D.Individual players may choose to use an adapted tuning for a specific tune when playing on a trichordo bouzouki, but doing so is fairly uncommon and only done by experienced players.
Many contemporary players choose to follow a D-G-B-E pattern for tetrachordo bouzoukis due, in part, to the similarity between this pattern and the pattern used for tuning a guitar.
When playing Irish music on either an Irish or Greek tetrachordo bouzouki, a pattern of G-D-A-D or A-D-A-D is typically used. These tunings make the instrument easy to play in the key of D.
If you have a short-scale instrument or large hands, it might be easiest to tune a tetrachordo bouzouki to a mandolin-style pattern of G-D-A-E. This tuning should be one octave lower than that used for an actual mandolin, however.

Tune your mandolin and enjoy.

",How to Restring a Mandolin," You can buy a complete set of 8 strings or buy individuals if you are only wanting to replace specific strings. Different brand strings sound different, so if you like the sound of your current strings, buy the same exact strings.You should be able to find great mandolin strings at your local musical instrument store or from an online retailer.


Choose the strings that will be suit your purposes. Remember that a higher price doesn't always mean the strings will be better.
Do not use strings for another instrument on a mandolin. Mandolin strings are made specifically for the instrument and thus other strings will not work the same way.;
, This will help you get through the steps of replacing your strings without confusion.


A mandolin at its simplest has only a few basic parts, the body, the neck (which contains the fretboard), the headstock, and strings. The strings are secured onto the mandolin at the top with tuners on the headstock (or peg head) and at the bottom with a tailpiece , as well as being held up off the body by a bridge, located near the sound holes in the middle of the body., Have enough room around you so that you can move it around freely.


You will also need to have your new strings near by, as well as a pair of wire snippers to clip the ends of the new strings once they are attached. Have these easily accessible.

, Look at the way the old string is wrapped around the post and turn the tuner knob in the direction that will loosen the string.


The tuner knob and the post that the string is attached to should rotate in the same direction, so you just need to pay attention to which direction the post needs rotate.Loosen the string quite a bit. It should be loose enough so that there is no tension on it and it can be easily slipped off the hook it's attached to at the bottom of the mandolin.

, This cover will be attached to the tailpiece at the bottom of your mandolin. It covers the area where the strings are attached to the tailpiece and protects your forearm while playing.This cover should just pop off the tailpiece by pulling up on it a bit or sliding it down toward the bottom of the mandolin.

, The tailpiece at the bottom of your mandolin has at least eight hooks on it, where the strings attach.Mandolin strings usually just have a loop at the end that attaches to one of the hooks on the tailpiece. You will just need to pull the loop off of the hook on the tailpiece to detach the string.

, With the other end of the string loose, twist the string off around the post of the tuner and pull the end of it out of the hole in the middle of the post.The string should come off easily.

, Be sure you are attaching the correct string, one that matches the one you just removed.


Once hooked on, keep the string taut so that it doesn't come off the hook.

, Make sure that the string is seated properly in the bridge and the nut, which is located at the top of the fretboard. These two pieces hold the string centered in place, as well as off the surface of the body and fretboard., This is a small hole but should fit the string easily.

, You want to lock the string in place, so put a kink in it right where it comes through the hole in the post. Then wrap the string around the post, locking it in place., You do not need to tune it yet, just make sure the string is taut and won't slip out of place.


Check once again the the string is seated correctly in the bridge and the nut. If not, loosen the string slightly then hold the string in place while you retighten it.

, Simply clip the string as close to the post as you can, making sure not to knick any other strings in the process.

, Remember, it's best to remove one string and then immediately replace it, instead of taking them all off at once.


Removing a single string, and then immediately replacing it, allows you to keep track of your strings, making sure that you are replacing each string with the same type.
Another reason for this is that the bridge and the tailpiece of your mandolin may be held on solely by pressure from the strings and thus may fall off if all the strings are removed. It's simply easier to keep them in place than to put them back in place.If you take off all the strings and your bridge or tailpiece fall off during string replacement, don't be surprised or worried. You will just need to put them back in place while you attach the new strings.

, Because new strings will stretch out naturally, forcing you to retune repeatedly, you can speed up this process by intentionally stretching new strings out a bit when you put them on. This should be done by over tightening them just a little bit. Be careful not to break them, especially the thin ones they are more delicate.


After they are just a bit overtightened, leave them to stretch out for at least 5 hours.

Work with one course at a time.,
Play the correct note.,
Pluck the string.,
Adjust the strings.,
Match the strings in a course.,
Double-check your work.",How to Tune a Greek Bouzouki2," You will need to tune each string course separately.


Hold the bouzouki as you would while playing it. Begin by tuning the course sitting at the bottom of the instrument, while you hold it in this manner, which are the highest pitched strings.
After finishing your adjustments to the bottom course, move to the course above it. Keep moving up, one course at a time, until you reach and tune the top course, which are the lowest pitched strings .;
, Play the correct source note on a pitch pipe, piano, or other stringed instrument. Listen to the way the note sounds.


The bottom course should be tuned to the appropriate note above Middle C.For both trichordo and tetrachordo bouzoukis, this would be the D just above Middle C (d' or D4).


The remaining courses should be adjusted accordingly to the bottom course.

For instance, on the tetrachordo bouzoukis, the lowest-pitched course has one string tuned to the Middle C (c' or C4) and one string tuned to the C an octave below it (c).



, Pluck one string of the course you are presently tuning, keeping the string open as you do. Listen to the way the note sounds in relation to the source note.


Keeping the string open means that the strings is free and not pressed down at any fret along the course of the instrument. After being plucked, the string should vibrate without interference.

, Turn the corresponding tuning peg to tune the string. Test the string after each adjustment until it matches the source note, such as played on your pitch pipe.


If the tone sounds flat or lower, tighten the strings by turning the tuning peg clockwise.
when the tone sounds sharp or higher, loosen the strings by twisting the tuning peg counterclockwise.
You may need to play the correct note several times on your pitch pipe or tuning instrument. Keep the sound in your mind for as long as possible and replay it each time you feel uncertain of how much further to adjust the course.

, Each string in one course should be in harmony with each other.

Adjust the other string in the course to sound either the same as, or an octave of, the string you just tuned to the source note. Strum them together to hear any differences and adjust if needed.

, After tuning all three or four courses, strum through the open strings again to check each.


For best results, double-check each course one at a time. Pluck one string, while you tune it to that note on your pitch pipe, then harmonize the other string to that string.
After tuning each string, and each course, strum all three or four courses together and listen to the sound. Everything should flow and mingle naturally.
Once you've double-checked your work, your instrument has been properly tuned.

Double-check your string courses.",How to Tune a Greek Bouzouki3," Most electronic tuners are already set to 440 Hz, but if yours is not set to a frequency yet, you will need to do so before you use it for your bouzouki.


The display may either read ""440 Hz"" or ""A = 440.""
Each tuner will need to be adjusted in a different manner, so read the instructions that come with yours to determine how to make an adjustment to the frequency. Usually, you will do so by pressing a ""Mode"" or ""Frequency"" button on the device.
Set the frequency to 440 Hz. If you must set the frequency by instrument, choose a “bouzouki” or ""guitar"" setting.

, Each course will need to be tuned separately. Start with the bottom string course and gradually work upward.


Hold the bouzouki as you would while playing it.
After you tune the bottom course, tune the course directly above it. Work upward until you reach and tune the top course.

, Unless you have a ""bouzouki"" setting on your digital tuner, you may need to set the desired note on the digital tuner when tuning each course.


The exact method for setting the note will vary based on the digital tuner you use, so you should check the manufacturer's instructions for help. Usually, however, you can change the note by pressing a ""Pitch"" or similarly labeled button.
The bottom course will need to be tuned to the corresponding note just above Middle C, so that is the initial note you will need to set your tuner to.

For both trichordo and tetrachordo bouzoukis, this would be the D above Middle C (d' or D4).


The remaining courses should be adjusted accordingly to the bottom course.

For instance, on the tetrachordo bouzoukis, the lowest-pitched course has one string tuned to the Middle C (c' or C4) and one string tuned to the C an octave below it (c).



, Pluck one string of the course you are presently tuning, keeping the string open as you do. Listen to the way the note sounds and watch the screen of your tuner for a reaction.


The string should be open as you pluck it. In other words, do not press the string along any fret of the instrument. The string must vibrate without interference after being plucked.

, As you pluck the string, watch the reaction of the monitor and indicator light of your digital tuner. The device should tell you when the instrument is in tune or out of tune.When the course is out of tune, a red light will usually flash.
The display screen of your tuner should indicate which note you just played. Depending on the type of digital tuner you have, the display screen may also indicate if the note is flat or sharp.
Once the string is in tune, a green or blue indicator light will usually flash.

, Make adjustments to the string pitches of the present course by rotating the corresponding tuning peg. Test the string after each adjustment.


Tighten the string of a flat or low note by rotating the peg clockwise.
Loosen the string of a high or sharp note by rotating the peg counterclockwise.
Repeat the tuning procedure for the other string in the course.
Repeat the tuning procedure for each string in all the other courses.

, After tuning all three or four courses, check each one again.


You will need to check each course one-bye-one. Set the note on your tuner, strum the open strings, and watch for the blue or green indicator light. If the course is out of tune, check each string within that course.
After tuning all of the strings and the courses, play them together and check the sound with your ear. The notes should flow together naturally.
The completion of this step finishes the entire process.

Keep your hand perpendicular to the strings and your thumb at a 50-60 degree angle with the string you're slapping.,
Remember, it's all in the wrist.,
First, to position your right hand.,
Now, using a hitch hiker or flopping fish action, bring your thumb down slowly and hit the string, when you hit the string try to hit the bottom half of it, the bottom of your thumb should end up on the next string.

,
Keep practicing that action until you get good hits, the ideal sound is a solid thump.

,
Now, try adding some popping to the technique.,
With either your middle or index finger, (which ever is most comfortable) put your finger underneath the string let's use the G string, pull up your finger until the string eventually snaps back down on the fretboard.

,
Now let's try putting both of those into one technique:

",How to Play Slap Bass," You will need to have your arm at a particular angle. Think of a traditional scarecrow with rigid upper arms. This may ache after a long period of playing, but you'll get used to it.;
, For a basic slap exercise, you can slap and pop an octave - an octave is 2 frets up and 2 strings up. Play an octave with your first and third fingers on your left hand.

, You need your thumb parallel to the string, (let's use the E string first).

,,, Popping is where you pull up on the string.

,,"
"

Start by making sure your bass is the correct height for you.,

With the bass standing upright, rest the back-right edge of the bass on your left inner hip or pelvis area.,

Place your left thumb on the back of the neck, a few inches from the scroll, Keep your left elbow up, parallel to the floor.,

Make sure the strings are in tune.,

The strings can be sounded in two main ways: Using a bow (arco) or plucked (pizzicato).,

Find an F# on the lowest string by hearing a Major 2nd interval from the open string (meaning 2 half steps).,

Move to the other strings in the same position, and get those notes in tune as well.On the A string,
index:B
middle:C
pinky:C#On D string,
index:E
middle:F
pinky:F#On the G string,
index:A
middle: B-flat
pinky:B,

By this time, you can work on 1/2 position (F, F#, G on the E string) and shifting between these first two positions.,

Work your way up the fingerboard, learning all the finger positions and their corresponding notes.
",How to Play String Bass," Adjust the end pin length. Test this by playing G on the E-string - your finger should be level with your eyes.
, Gently place your left knee on the back of the bass. Your feet should be in an ""L"" shape with your left foot parallel with the back of the bass., Keep your palm off of the neck, and let your fingers form a ""claw"" shape, hovering over the strings, with only flat fingertips touching the strings. (like squeezing a ball between fingertip and thumb), You can use a tuning fork or an electric tuner, or use tuning harmonics (explained elsewhere). The lowest (thickest) string is E, then A, D, and G., Classical music primarily uses the bow, while jazz, bluegrass, and other contemporary styles use pizzicato primarily. To pluck the bass properly, align your index finger pointing downward, pulling the string away with as much of your finger (from tip to middle knuckle) as possible. Proper bowing technique starts with a proper grip for your style of bow, and a relaxed body and hand. Keep the bow perpendicular to the strings, halfway between the bridge and fingerboard. The feeling should be of pulling the sound from the string rather than pressing down on the string, although significant pressure is required for clear sound., If you lay the rest of your fingers down, you naturally rest in first position. That is F# on your first finger, G on your second (middle) finger, and G# under your pinky. Work with these intervals until you get them in tune.,, Half position begins a half step lower in tone than First position on all strings.,"

Pick up your lyre (let's assume a 6-string in C for the sake of argument) and tune it to a standard diatonic major tuning: C-D-E-F-G-A.,
To form a C Major chord: use your left-hand fingertips to muffle the second, fourth, and sixth strings.,
To form a D Minor chord: block the first, third, and fifth strings.",How to Play Chords on an Anglo Saxon Lyre,"

(Chord formations for other tunings are given in the sections following);
, In tablature, this would be o-X-o-X-o-X, with the ""o"" representing an open string, and the ""X"" representing a blocked/muffled string (as you're looking at the face of the instrument). This leaves you with C, E, and G, which are the notes of a C major chord. Now just strum your right hand across all the strings, much like playing the guitar., Like this: X-o-X-o-X-o. This gives you the notes D-F-A, which form a Dm chord."

Most lever harps and pedal harps are played with the soft part- sides or tips- of your thumb and first three fingers (the little finger is too small and weak to pluck with.),
On pedal harps, all pedals in the middle position is C major.,
On a lever harp, raising the sharping lever will raise the note a half-step.,
Now, with your right hand hold out your first finger.,
Congratulations!,
Keep learning the basics thoroughly, then branch out and develop your skill range.",How to Play the Harp," When most people think of a harp, they either picture a large, golden pedal harp in an orchestra or some type of lyre being played by angels on a Christmas card. Actually, the two most common styles of harp are lever harps and pedal harps.


Lever harps have sharping levers at the top to change the notes.
Pedal harps have seven pedals that can make notes flat, natural, or sharp.
There are also wire-strung harps, double-strung harps, triple harps, Aeolian harps and other less common styles.
Remember: a person who plays a lever harp is a harper; a person who plays a pedal harp is called a harpist.;
, While you can play Celtic music on a pedal harp or a classical piece on a lever harp, these styles of harps are really different instruments for different purposes.


The pedal harp is loud enough to be heard in an orchestra and its pedals allow it to more easily play classical music. It is big, relatively heavy, and has a complicated mechanism that needs periodic adjustment.
The lever harp is often softer and warmer in tone, and is lighter and more portable.
People who like Celtic music often choose Celtic-style lever harps, or wire-strung harps.
People who perform at Renaissance Fairs may choose a high-headed ""Gothic"" harp.
Those who like classical music often choose a pedal harp or a lever harp with concert tension and spacing so that the change to a pedal harp will be easier.
People who travel or do harp therapy sometimes choose a smaller instrument, while professional wedding harpers and harpists may want a decorative harp.
Some people like more unusual double-strung harps.

, Even used pedal harps will usually cost close to $15,000. If you aren't sure, purchase or rent a lever harp. With fewer strings and a smaller investment, a lever harp will allow you to get a feel for the instrument without spending an immense amount of money or having to deal with pedals/foot movements. If you want to play Celtic music, a lever harp may be your best choice anyway. But if you want to be able to play on a more advanced level, you should consider buying or renting a pedal harp since it is much easier to play when on a higher level.]


While it is best to be able to play an instrument before purchase, harps can be ordered from reputable harp-dealers on the internet. Be wary, however, of some of the inexpensive ($300-$400) harps that are made in Pakistan and only buy antique or used harps with the advice of an experienced harper/harpist. A cheap antique harp may need thousands of dollars of repairs before it can be played.

, Sit in a comfortable, solid chair that is the correct height for your harp. You need to be able to easily play the middle of the harp-strings. You will need the shortest strings closest to your body and the longer strings will be further away from you.


If you have a lap-harp, you may have to rest its base on a box in front of you.

, It shouldn't feel too heavy if it is balanced correctly. The harp doesn't have to be straight in front of you; you can turn it sideways a bit so that you can see the strings. You should be seated so that your arms are a little below 90 degrees angle with your body, parallel with the floor and in the middle of the strings. At this point, your feet should rest on the floor.

, Hand position is a much-debated area among harpers/harpists. Some instructors follow one technique and other instructors prefer other styles. There is no ""one"" technique that is right for all harpers and harpists. There are some similarities, however, such as relaxing the hands as often as possible, that are good common sense and will help prevent injuries. Most teachers also emphasize being sure to close the fingers and thumb into the palm after playing a note. This will help you get more sound out of your harp, as well as minimizing injury risk.

, If you have not acquired a strong ear for music, you can use an electric tuner. Using the tuning key that came with the harp, you can carefully tighten or loosen the strings to change the notes. This is an area where an experienced musician will be of great help to you.


If you have a pedal harp, you will be sure that all pedals are disengaged before tuning. Place each pedal in the flat key, which is the top notch.
If you have a lever harp, be sure all levers are disengaged. With your lever harp, you will probably first tune to the key of C Major. That is, A strings will be As, the B strings will be Bs, Cs will be Cs, etc. Later you can tune your lever harp with some notes flat to make it easier to play songs in other keys.

, You may also purchase a self-teaching method, although this is not a complete teacher replacement. In looking for a teacher, try to find one who respects the style of music that you wish to play, and who can teach you the appropriate technique for your style of harp.

, They are like the keys on a piano: A,B,C,D,E,F,G repeated over and over again. The red strings are Cs, the black or blue strings are Fs. If you can already play the piano, the strings will come more naturally to you and you will most likely get used to the strings much faster than non-piano players.

, When playing a lever or pedal harp, fingernails must be kept short. Wire-strung harps and certain advanced techniques for other harps are played with the finger nails.

, Raising a pedal will drop the note to a flat and lowering the pedal will raise the note to a sharp.

, If the string was tuned to a flat, then raising the lever will raise the note to a natural. If the string was natural, then raising the lever will make the note a sharp.


The E, A and B levers should always be up. Everything else should be lowered, unless a piece requires a C#, etc.

, Place it on the harp strings as far as you can reach and pull it quickly toward you so that it slides and makes each string ring out. Be careful not to let your knuckles collapse as you do this, as that will decrease the sound quality.

, You've just done your first harp glissando!

, For example, do not try doing complicated glissandos ('glisses') until you have mastered the basics. And remember to develop hand positioning too, two fingers, then three, then four. Do not try to master harmonics until you have reached a higher level. Take it gradually and the more advanced learning will become easier if you've mastered the fundamentals fully.

Put the first mallet between your pointer finger and thumb.,
Put the second mallet between your ring finger and your middle finger.,
Repeat steps one and two for the third and fourth mallets, which go in your other hand.

,
Play the mallets that are between your thumb and pointer finger, you simply hold onto the mallet with those fingers and move it up and down.,
Playing the mallet between your ring finger and pinkie is slightly harder.",How to Play Four Mallet Marimba," The end of the mallet should reach to the center of your palm. The mallet is kept in place by your palm, pointer finger and thumb.;
, The end of the mallet should reach to about the first line in your palm.

,, Try not to move your hand at all while doing this; only the mallet and the two fingers should move.

, To make the movement, imagine that you’re opening a doorknob. In fact, a good way to practice this movement is by turning a doorknob a couple of times and paying particular attention to the rotation that occurs. You want to duplicate this rotation. Your wrist should twist slightly away from you, bringing the top of the mallet downward. With practice, this movement will become minimal – you won’t have to move your wrist very much at all to make the mallet move downward. As you play you'll teach yourself how to roll just imagine a doorknob you can't open and your twisting and turning it .

The standard size of a professional marimba comes in a 5 octave model. If you are looking to become a professional marimbist, you will want to invest in a high-end, 5 octave marimba, preferably with high-quality bars made of Honduras Rosewood as these will have a richer and more authentic sound. These models tend to be on the more expensive side, but will save you the trouble of upgrading to a more professional instrument later.If you are a beginner, or simply looking to learn the marimba for recreational or educational purposes, you may find it easier to learn to play on a smaller 4 1/3 or 4 octave model.High-end marimbas can run anywhere from $2,000-$5,500. However, marimbas with synthetic bars rather than wooden bars are much less expensive. Be aware that they may lack a bit of sound quality, but can still be used for learning purposes.Practice marimbas as well as rentals are also available at monthly rates.;
, Purchase a new or used marimba from percussion shop, or outlet which regularly sells percussion instruments. Try to get an appraisal from any legitimate percussionist who may be able to search the instrument for cracks and other defects. If you’ve decided to purchase one from an online retailer such as Amazon.com or eBay, be sure to purchase from sellers with good reputations.To learn the basics, any marimba will do, but a more advanced instrument may be necessary later on, such as different sounding mallets or a larger marimba.
The height of the marimba can be adjusted and should generally stand at or right below the hips. Adjustable marimbas are recommended for growing children who are learning to play.

, The marimba can be played with anywhere from 2-4 mallets. Beginners should start with two.


You will want to purchase marimba mallets made with either birch, wood, rattan or fiberglass handles (or shafts) and rounded heads made of yarn with a rubber core.Mallets typically range from $15-$45 per set, and vary in color and weight. Lighter weight mallets are more useful for beginners. Go to a local percussion shop and get a feel for different mallets to determine the best weight for you. The mallets should feel light enough to gently go from bar to bar in rhythm while playing, as opposed to feeling heavy.

, The notes on the lower row go as follows: C D E F G A B C D E. The upper row (starting at the note directly after C) is: C# D# F# G# A# C# D#.

, You can find it by looking at the notes on the upper row (the sharps and flats) and finding a pair of two bars (not three) on the right end. The note directly to the left of this pair, on the lower row, is C. Middle C is the C closest to the center of the marimba.


The layout of a marimba is much like the layout of a piano where the sharps and flats (the black keys) are represented by the upper row. The grouping pattern is the same “3,2,3,2.”
Marimbas have graduated bars, meaning that the size of the bars change with each note. Thicker bars will be found on the left side of the marimba and are lower in pitch. Thinner bars will be found toward the right side and will have higher pitches.

, Learn exactly which bars play each note so that your mallets know where to go while playing. This is a great way to enhance muscle memory and helps to gain familiarity with your instrument.

, It should be held at the point where the mallet feels balanced. Next, you should rest the end of the mallet in your palm. Hold the end in place with your other three fingers.Then repeat on the other hand.


The mallets should be held, with your palms down, and with the mallet heads hovering over the bars. Hold the mallet close to the fleshy part of the palms so the mallet can easily be lifted after strikingThe mallets should meet into a near ‘V’ shape over the bars.

, This ensures that your weight is distributed evenly while striking each bar. The lower bars should be closest to you, while the upper bars require a very slight extension to reach them.


The marimba is larger than the average xylophone so a small step may be needed to the left or right. Be sure not to turn the body or lean toward out of reach keys. Merely take a small step to the left or right while ensuring that your body is directly facing the instrument., To play a note, hold the mallets over the note you wish to strike. Raise the mallet up with your wrist instead of your arm. Then quickly strike the mallet against the note and quickly lift.


Use your other hand to strike the same note and quickly lift. Continue to alternate strikes onto one bar only. Remember to keep your grip loose and your wrists relaxed.The mallets should hit the note directly in the center of the bar on top of the resonator for the best sound (the resonators are the tubes/pipes under the marimba that help to project and sustain the sound of a mallet strike)., There are twelve major scales that can be played on the marimba which are the same as those played on a piano or keyboard. You can begin by playing a C Major scale by striking the following bars in order: C,D,E,F,G,A,B.


Be sure to utilize both hands. Start with the left hand and strike the C note, then use the right hand to strike the D note, use the right hand to hit the next note, E and so on.
Start at a slow speed, hitting approximately one note per second. Then build up to a faster speed, repeating the scale with alternating strikes until you are comfortable.
Continue with a D Major scale: D E F# G A B C# D.

, Percussion shops often have beginner sheet music available, as do many online retailers.

, The majority of professional marimbists use four mallets while playing. If you wish to become an advanced percussionist, this is a grip that should be practiced.


Grab one mallet with your right hand and wrap your ring and pinkie finger completely around the mallet near the bottom.Pick up the other mallet and place the very bottom tip of the mallet in the middle of the right palm. Then wrap your middle finger around the mallet to grip it.Use your thumb and index finger to steady the second mallet. Place the index finger on the back, then point the index finger like a gun.Repeat these steps on the left hand.

, The most effective way to become a better marimba player is to practice. Designate time to play scales and other pieces on a regular basis.

, Introductory workshops and lessons are widely available for beginners where one can learn to play new music and learn playing techniques and improvisational skills.

, Use a cloth to wipe dust, fingerprints and dirt. Synthetic bars can be cleaned with a bit of soap and water., If you plan to travel with your marimba, or plan to use it in a school environment, make sure you have a cover. Some companies offer a cover as a standard option, others have to be purchased separately.A marimba cover will protect the instrument against outdoor debris, scratches, dust and spills. Covers usually come in flannel material or denim., Be sure to remove any objects or debris that may have fallen inside of the resonators and use a natural oil (lemon oil works well) to polish them and protect against rust., Broken bars, rusted resonators, heat damage repair and tuning should all be handled by a professional. Percussion shops and instrument restoration shops are best equipped to handle these issues.


Tuning marimba bars can be particularly tricky and may require carving and checking its pitch using a chromatic tuner. Bars must also be sanded and attuned with its corresponding resonator.

Position your hand on the dayan, the smaller drum on the right.,
Practice hitting the daylan.,
Position your left hand onto the bayan, the larger drum on your left.,
Practice hitting the baylan.,
Learn how to follow tabla bol (wordings).Indian percussionists follow a system of wordings, as opposed to a western system of musical notation.,
Practice playing the tabla.,
Increase the rhythm gradually after you have mastered the basic stroke of playing the tabla.,
Play around with different sounds you can make on the drum.",How to Play Tabla," The tabla consists of two separate wooden drums, one smaller and one larger. The smaller drum, positioned on the right, is called the daylan (or tabla) and the larger drum, positioned on the left, is called the baylan.Each drum makes a different tone but together they make the distinctive sound we associate with the tabla, a sound that is central to classical Indian music.;
, In order to play this drum well and keep your instrument in good working condition, it is important to understand how it is made. The daylan is made of wood, usually from a Neem or Shisham tree. The baylan is made out of metal or clay.The two drums are made of different materials so that each has a distinct sound all its own.









Both drums are covered with a goatskin drum heads. The drum heads are attached to the drum with long leather strips that attach to a leather ring at the bottom of the drum.
In order to tune the drum, tabla makers insert wooden blocks between the drum body and the leather strips. Moving the wooden blocks up and down along the drum adjusts the tightness of the drum head and tone of the drum.
An element that is unique to the tabla is the application of the sinai, a patch of iron fillings mixed with rice paste applied to the surface of the drum, right on the goat hide, which allows for further tuning of the drums., Before starting to play, you need to learn how to position your body correctly, as posture and body position are very important to playing the tabla.









Sit cross legged on the ground. This will position your body on the same level as your tabla.
Place the drums in front of you, close enough to almost touch your legs, with the space between the drums right at the center of your body. The larger drum, on your left, should sit flat, with the top of the drum facing straight up. The face of the smaller drum, on your right, should be facing away from you, at approximately 35 degrees.The position of your waist should straight. Keep your posture upright.
You should put one hand on each drum. Make sure that each of your hands can comfortably reach the drums in front of them. The placement of both hands should not be stiff. It should be in comfortable position, so that playing tabla is easy.

, The three fingers starting from the right of your hand, your middle finger, ring finger and little finger, should be positioned on the sinai at the center of the drum.









Make sure that your index finger is raised up away from the head of the drum just a little bit.Rest the heel of your hand on the edge of the drum.

, Keep your contact with the drum centered on the sinai at the center of the drum head.









Lift your hand just a few inches and then bring down your middle, ring, and little fingers onto the center of the drum. This is a stroke called Te.Lift your hand just a few inches and then bring down just your pointer finger into the very center of the sinai. This is a stroke called Teh., Place the palm of your hand on the drum, so that your hand covers up the syahi and your elbow is bent. If you are in the correct position the heel of your hand will be just covering the syahi and your forearm will be resting on the edge of the drum.









The sinai on the baylan is positioned off center. Make sure your drum is positioned so that the sinai is at about 2 o'clock, if the top of the drum was a clock. This makes it comfortable for your palm to cover it and your forearm to rest on the edge of the drum.

, Keep your forearm resting on the drum and simply lift your hand up, flexing at the wrist, and bring it down gently. This stroke is called Ke.







, Each word in a bol stands in for a sound you make on the drum, for example the strokes Te and Teh that you have already learned. A series of these words will create a bol.








, While practicing, keep the rhythm slow so that you can focus on hitting the drum and combining sounds correctly.









Don't try to practice more than one tabla bol at a time. Repeat the practice of same bol at least one hour a day.
While practicing, avoid talking with others. Concentrate on tabla playing.

, Your goal should be to increase speed but not at the expense of losing accuracy.








, Once you have mastered the basics of the tabla, feel free to experiment with your own style. For example, use the force of index finger on the edge of tabla to create a nice tone.

Grip the sticks properly.,
Keep your stroke style closed rather than open.,
Play confidently yet softly.",How to Play Percussion Instruments1," For playing the concert snare drum, the accepted grip is the matched grip. Pinch each stick between your thumb and pointer finger about a third up from the butt. Wrap the other 3 fingers loosely around the butt for control.
, When learning elementary strokes or playing marching percussion, the tendency is that rolls, flams, and drags are played in an ""open"" style, meaning that each stroke is distinct. When playing concert snare drum, however, strive to close your multi-stroke rudiments as much as possible. This style of playing is more lyrical and blends better with orchestral or symphonic music., Because the snare drum's sound is such a tight, percussive ""crack,"" it projects well even when played softly and can easily overwhelm fellow musicians if played loudly. For this reason, listen to fellow musicians and play at a slightly lower dynamic level than you think you need to. You can produce a softer sound from the snare drum by playing near the edge of the head."
"
Prepare a range of different mallets.,
Get into the proper playing position.,
Pull the sound from the drum.,
Follow through on each stroke.",How to Play Percussion Instruments2," Unlike the snare drum, the concert bass drum requires a range of mallet densities for different passages and styles of music. At the least, keep 1 soft bass drum mallet and 1 medium-hard mallet., Ideally, the bass drum should be slanted so that the head is at about a 45 degree angle to the ground. Hold the mallet with your dominant hand and place your other palm gently onto the head of the drum. Strike the head just off-center with the mallet and vary the pressure with your other hand to muffle the drum as needed., When playing a concert bass drum it is important that the sound properly resonates and fulfills its roll in a piece of music properly. In order to convey the low-pitched sound of the drum to the audience try striking the drum in a ""scooping"" motion as if you are pulling the sound from the drum., Because the bass drum's head is loosely tensioned and does not provide much rebound, the tendency is to strike it and leave the mallet against or near the head. Instead, make a conscious effort to follow through on each stroke just as you would on a snare drum or tom, returning the mallet to its playing position as quickly as possible."
"
Grip the mallets properly.,
Develop an ear for tuning.,
Use only open-style, single-stroke rudiments.,
NEVER strike a the drum in its center.",How to Play Percussion Instruments3," The timpani is alone among percussion instruments in that the standard grip is the French grip. This grip is similar to the matched grip, except that the palms are at right angles to the floor. Studying and using this grip will facilitate quick and graceful changes between each drum with minimal arm movement., Perhaps even more important than playing the correct rhythms on timpani is tuning the drums correctly. Timpani heads are tightened and slackened using foot pedals, and you will need to be able to retune drums silently during a piece of music. This can be done by quietly humming into the drum head - when the drum is tuned to the pitch you are humming, you will hear it resonate back., A major error in novice timpani technique is playing closed-style buzz rolls (like you would on a concert snare drum) or playing double-stroke rolls or ""diddles."" All rolls and ruffs played on the timpani should be single-stroke, where you alternate your left and right hands evenly., You want a timpani to resonate. If you strike the center you will simply hear a thud in contrast to the full sound the timpani is known to produce. It may seem unimportant but the timpani is an integral part to many classical pieces and needs to be heard."
"
Develop a rear-fulcrum grip.,
Use the appropriate mallet for each instrument.,
Blend with the section you are accompanying.",How to Play Percussion Instruments4," The proper grip for mallet percussion instruments like the marimba, the xylophone, and the glockenspiel is a variation on the matched grip. Instead of pinching the mallet between your thumb and forefinger to create the fulcrum, squeeze the butt of the mallet gently with your ring finger and pinky. Your other 3 fingers are then wrapped loosely around the mallet to provide extra control., Each mallet percussion instrument requires a different type of mallet to sounds its best and remain undamaged. The marimba is played with soft yarn mallets, the vibraphone with hard yarn mallets, the xylophone with rubber or plastic mallets, and the glockenspiel with plastic or brass mallets., Unlike other percussion instruments, whose parts are not duplicated in the rest of the ensemble, mallet percussion parts often duplicate passages that are being played by wind or string instruments. For this reason, it is important to listen carefully to the ensemble and try to blend well with the other instruments playing your part."

Opt for a hard, well-padded case.,
If you can, attach a hygrometer to monitor the humidity of the inside of your case.,
Always loosen your bow after you have finished using it.,
Always wash your hands before playing or handling your instrument.,
Wipe rosin off the stick of the bow and off your instrument after each practice.,
Always be gentle with your instrument when you lay it down or pick it up.

,
Avoid putting your instrument in places where people could kick it.

,
Don't leave your instrument out of its case for long periods of time unless it is properly covered.

,
Don't leave your instrument in the sun or other places like a car for long periods of time where it could get hot.,
Don't leave your mute on the bridge if you're not using it.

,
Try not to let your friends touch or play your instrument as this could damage it.

,
Take care when tuning.

,
Spend time with your instrument.",How to Care for a Stringed Instrument," When taking your instrument out and about, a hard case and good cushioning will reduce the risk of damaging the instrument.;
, Good cases come with one already attached.

, Tightness over a long period of time will damage the curved wood of the bow and the horse hairs.

, This will prevent fingerprints, oil, grime and other general dirt from building up on your instrument.

, Common places where rosin accumulates are between the fingerboard and the bridge, on and under the fingerboard, under the bridge and on the strings. Use a gentle cloth.

,,,, Your instrument could become unglued.

,,,, A played instrument is a happy one.

Fill the tub with lukewarm water.,
Soak the cymbal.,
Dry the cymbal.,
Apply the polish.,
Rinse off the polish.",How to Polish Cymbals," The tub has to be able to fit the cymbal in it. If the water in your tub is too hot or too cold, it will ruin the cymbal and possibly crack it. Make sure that the water in your tub is nice and warm. A good mix is 1/3 of cold water and 2/3 of hot water. To test the water, stick your hand in the tub. Your hand shouldn't get cold but it shouldn't burn either. It should feel like a relaxing bath.;
, Take your cymbal off it's stand and gently lay it down into the tub. It should be face up like you'd have it mounted on your stand. The cymbal doesn't have to be soaking in the tub for hours, just leave it in there for 1-3 minutes. This will help loosen visible dirt and will help with the rest of the polishing process. Leaving the cymbal in the tub for too long can damage it so be sure to not leave it in there for longer than three minutes.

, To dry the cymbal, take it out of the tub and lay it on a dry towel. With another separate, small cloth, pat the cymbal dry. Don't hit the cymbal really hard, a small and light pat will do. For one or two minutes, focus on getting the cymbal dry by patting it. Never scrub the cymbal as this can completely ruin the sound and looks of it.

, Put some cymbal polish (whatever one you've chosen) on a small, dry, clean cloth. Clean a small area of the drum cymbal and wait for the polish to soak in. If you try to clean the whole cymbal in one go, the polish will dry and become very hard to remove. If you're not sure about what way to clean the cymbal (I.e, Clockwise or Anti-clockwise) just keep in mind that you need to follow the grooves engraved in the cymbal. Keep repeating this step until you've cleaned the whole cymbal.

, Dip another small, clean cloth into the lukewarm water tub and gently wipe the polish off. You still want to follow the grooves in the cymbal and you should avoid scrubbing the cymbal too hard. Every time you rinse off a small part of the cymbal, dry it using the same technique described in step 3. Keep repeating this step until the whole cymbal is rinsed and dried and you're pretty much done. Enjoy your shiny, new cymbals!

Clean a large aluminum coffee can.,
Secure a piece of felt over the coffee can.,
Create mallets for playing the drum.",How to Make Percussion Instruments With Household Items1," Remove the lid from an aluminum coffee can and rinse out the inside. The can will form the body or ""shell"" of the drum. You can remove the label and decorate the outside of the can if desired.;
, Cut a circle of felt about 2 inches (5 cm) bigger in diameter than the opening of the coffee can. Place the felt over the opening and secure it using rubber bands. This will form the head of the drum.

, An easy way to construct mallets for the coffee can drum is by sharpening the ends of 2 wooden dowels and then sticking them into 2 small rubber balls. Hold the dowels along their shafts and strike the drum head with the rubber balls.

Spread some dried beans onto a paper plate.,
Fold the plate in half.,
Staple the edges of the plate closed.",How to Make Percussion Instruments With Household Items2," Another simple percussion instrument can be made by sealing some beans into a plate. Begin by placing a small handful of the dried beans onto the center of the plate.

, While keeping the beans from falling out, fold the plate over onto itself so that it forms a half-moon shape with the beans sealed inside.

, Use a stapler to seal the two edges of the folded plate closed. You can now shake the plate in different rhythmic patterns to produce a maraca-like tone.

Punch holes around the edge of a plastic plate.,
String some twist ties through jingle bells.,
Affix the jingle bells to the plate.",How to Make Percussion Instruments With Household Items3," Use a single hole punch to punch 5 or 6 evenly spaced holes around the edge of a plastic or paper plate. If you use thin paper plates, you may want to stack 2 plates together for added stability.

, For the tambourine, you'll need as many jingle bells and twist ties as you have holes. Run the twist tie through the middle of each jingle bell and bend both ends towards each other to prevent the bell from falling off of the tie.

, Run the twist tie of each jingle bell through a hole in the edge of the plate. Tie each bell on tightly by twisting the twist tie around itself. You can now play the tambourine by either shaking it or by striking the plate's surface with your palm or fingers.

Choose the right size castanets.,
Determine handedness for each castanet.,
Put on your castanets.,
Swap sides with your castanets if left handed.,
Test the tightness of your castanets.,
Hide your castanets in your hands.,
Choose mounted castanets for orchestral performances.,
Practice a simple roll in the right hand.,
Add rhythm with your left hand.,
Create the ""PI"" sound in your right hand.,
Drill the ""PAM"" sound using both castanets.,
Learn the finishing sound ""PAN"".,
Practice different strikes in different patterns.,
Use mounted castanets for orchestral performances.",How to Play Castanets," This is largely a matter of preference, as the string connecting the shells of your castanets are adjustable. The size of your castanets will also influence the tone you create. Generally, you'll want a pair that fit comfortably in your hand and can be hidden easily from view in your palm.


Sizes range from three, which is usually for children or to achieve high pitches, up to nine for larger hands and deeper tones.;
, Each castanet is made of two shells tied together with the hollow side of each shall facing inward. One set will have a higher pitch; this is your ""hembra"" (which means female in Spanish) castanet and is worn on your right hand. Your other castanet will have a lower pitch; this is the ""macho"" (meaning male in Spanish) and will be worn on your left hand.Many times there will be a marking, like a small letter R, on the hembra (right) pair of castanets.

, Now that you've determined the hembra (right) castanet from the macho (left) one, take the string connecting the shells of your hembra castanet pull it so two loops emerge from either end of the castanet. Then put your thumb through both loops, being sure that for both hands the loops of your castanets:


Rest on either side of your knuckle.
Run along the bottom of your thumbnail and base of your thumb.
The knot of the string is on the bottom loop and faces toward your body.

, Since the melody and the majority of the complex rhythms are going to be in your right hand, left handers might have an easier time playing if they wear the macho (left) castanet on their right hand. However, many left handers still play right handed, as this is the traditional way of playing castanets and makes group instruction, where the traditional way is most frequently used, easier.

, If your castanets are too loose, the sound you create won't be bright or clear. Additionally, loose castanets can fall off while performing or practicing, so you may want to start with your castanets tight, tap your fingers on the shells to check tone, and then loosen your knots as needed.


Adjust the length of your castanet string by sliding the knot tighter or looser.
Aim for a string length that feels stable, comfortable, and snug., Castanets are often coupled with dance, like in zambra flamenco dancing.Showing your castanets to the audience while performing a dance can detract from the aesthetic, where the trills and clacks of the castanets appear linked with the motions of the dance.

, Professional percussionists in an orchestra often have to coordinate many instruments at once, and to save time during a performance taking castanets on and off, performers might make use of mounted castanets. These can be bought at some music stores, and can also be found through online retailers., Start with your pinkie finger and tap the top of your castanet. Then follow your pinkie with your ring finger, and do the same for the rest of your fingers until you reach your pointer finger.This is a simple castanet roll in your hembra (right) castanet.


This sound is sometimes called ""RRI"" by castanet teachers., Your macho (left) castanet will punctuate the bassline of your castanet sound, creating the rhythm. Use your middle finger and ring finger to tap your macho castanet at the end of every right hand roll. This will create a slightly heavier, deeper toned rhythm.


This sound is sometimes referred to by experts as ""TA""., This move will be nearly identical to your approach to making the ""TA"" sound, only instead of using your left hand, you'll use the ring and middle fingers of your right hand to make the sound. Alternate between this and your roll to acquaint yourself with the different sensations., This sound is also sometimes referred to as ""CHIN"", for its clashing quality. This sound requires you to collide the castanets together while they are in front of your body.While each pair of castanets are unique, semi-professional castanets and higher quality pairs are built to withstand this strike.
Perform this move sharply.

, This powerful sounding clap is often used to end a sequence, as it has a tone of finality to it. Use your pinkie, ring, and middle fingers to strike both castanets at the same time.


Be sure you strike your castanets at the same time, otherwise the powerful effect will be staggered and weak., While it is generally true that the complicated rhythms of the melody should remain in your hembra (right) castanet, you should experiment with different finger strikes used in different patterns. Alternate between trills and bassline ""TA"" strikes, clap back and forth with ""TA"" and ""PI"", then finish strong with ""PAN"".

, Mounted castanets are played with the hand, drumstick, or mallet. The castanets are attached to a piece of wood and connected in such a way that leaves space for the castanets to come together to make noise.


Shake mounted castanets back and forth in smooth, regular motions to create clicking/clapping sound.
Ricochet the clapper between your knee and hand for a fast roll.
Use drumsticks on the castanets to further sculpt the sound."

Cut the dowels to about 14""-17"" in length.,
Stick one end of the scissors into the hole in the ball knob, twisting it to shave the inside until to hole is large enough for the dowel to fit into it snugly.

,
Make sure the dowel will slide about half an inch into the ball knob.,
Wrap a few rubber bands around the mallet.,
Tie a clove hitch around the bottom of the rubber core.,
Wrap the mallet once around the shaft (Over the clove hitch) then wrap it OVER the core.,
Turn it around the shaft and make a perpendicular ""prime meridian"" to the first one you made in the previous step.,
Turn it around the shaft again and follow the previous 2 steps to make another X.,
At the top of the mallet there should be a little nipple where the lines overlap.,
Keep wrapping the same way and keep count of how many times you wrapped it.,
When done with the number of desired wraps, there should be a little hole at the top.,
With the needle, stitch the top of the mallet.,
Repeat this pattern tightly.,
Using the same ""donut"" stitching technique, stitch a bottom ring with the 3 inches of slack left in the beginning.,
Repeat the steps before this again to make an identical second mallet.,
Sand down the dowels to the exact same length and smooth out the bottom if you might use them in a 4 mallet grip.

",How to Make Marimba Mallets," Ensure they are cut to the exact same size.;
,, Take it out, put a few drops of wood glue in the hole, and push the dowel back in. You can put a little more glue around the base of the ball knob to secure it.

, (For extra rebound and a bigger mallet. Not extremely necessary)

, Leave about 3 inches of extra yarn for stitching the bottom.

, (By OVER, Imagine the mallet core as a globe with the north pole at the top and the south pole where the mallet shaft is inserted. Outline a ""Prime Meridian"" of the ""globe"" with the yarn. NOT the equator.)

, (Looking at the mallet from the top there should be an X)

, This X should be a 45 degree turn compared the first X. Now from above it should like 4 lines intersecting at the middle. Kind of like a pizza pie with 8 slices.

, Start wrapping OVER the mallet slightly off-center. When coming over hook the yarn tightly around the nipple, NOT directly on top of it.

, (Remember not directly over the intersection of the first 4 wraps that made the ""pizza looking pattern"" or ""overlapping X's pattern"") You can wrap anywhere from 100-275 wraps. The hardness of the mallet depends on the type of yarn, the core, and the amount of wraps. Try it occasionally to see if its the sound you want. Be careful though because it might unravel.

, Leave about 3 inches of slack and cut the yarn. Thread the end of the yarn into the needle.

, (To do this think of a donut. Imagine wrapping a donut with yarn. Through the middle, pull from the bottom, and do it again.) Using this technique might fill the hole if using a thick enough yarn.

, Right when there is no more slack cut the yarn and any remaining slack should be tucked in the hole at the top and can be glued tight.

, If the mallet ever loosens from the bottom, restitch it quickly. If the clove hitch shows and the slack gets too long, the mallet might unravel.

, Wrap the yarn the same amount of times to get the closest sound possible.

Learn the finger names.,
Start with your right hand.,
Practice playing up and down this position.,
Learn a few chords.,
Learn some basic songs.,
Get your grade 1.,
Get into more advanced pieces.,
Keep going until you reach grade 8.",How to Play Fast on the Keyboard,"


Your thumb is finger 1
Your index finger is finger 2
Your middle finger is finger 3
Your ring finger is finger 4
Your pinky finger is finger 5;
, Place all of your fingers in the ""middle c"" hand position. This means finger 1 is on C, finger 2 is on D, finger 3 is E, finger 4 is on F and finger 5 is on G. To find this position quickly, just put your thumb on C and let the other fingers fall into place, one finger to one note.

, So you should play 1, then 2, then 3, then 4, then 5, and then back down (5,4,3,2,1). Remember to count out loud. Count 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 as you play that finger. Keep a steady pace. Play this very slowly and gradually speed up. Most keyboards come with a built in metronome, this will help you greatly. Set the speed to 80 BPM (beats per minute) to start with, then speed up until you can play 110 BPM. If the tempo is ever to fast, just slow it down. This exercise will get you used to moving your fingers around.

, A good one to learn is the C chord. Every time you count 1, play and hold the C chord. This will get you used to playing with chords and you will need that to play in the future.

, Once you're used to moving around with chords, learn some easy keyboard songs. You could just buy a grade 1 music book that comes with songs because they are very easy. Take a trip down to your local music shop and speak to the people there about easy songs to learn. They will be willing to help you. They could also show you some tips on how to play faster. Remember to practice very slowly so you can speed it up and still be accurate.

, If you have a keyboard tutor, speak to them about getting your grade 1 in keyboard. This will keep you motivated and you will have something to show for your hard work in the future. If you don't want the grade, skip this step. If you do, take another trip to your local music store and ask them about it.

, Once you master the easy stuff, master some more advanced songs. The best thing to do is get your grade 2. The grade 2 is very similar to grade 1 so it's not that hard.

, Now you have truly mastered the keyboard. You should be able to play pretty fast by now too. If you're not fussed about the grades, just keep learning until you can play very well. Do not aim to play fast when starting out, just aim to play well. Speed will come with time.

, If you’re having trouble remembering what note is which it might help to put little circular stickers on each key. You can write the note of each key inside the sticker. Make sure you don’t damage your keyboard! Don’t write on the keyboards.


Place the stickers on the notes that you are going to play for this song.

, You can find the sheet music for chopsticks many places online. You’ll want to be able to refer to the sheet music as you play while you are learning. Once you memorize it you can get rid of the sheet music. You don't have to do this, but it will help you have something to refer to. If you can't read music you can just write down the notes to play on a piece of paper.

Make sure you start with the notes that you see on the sheet music for chopsticks. The easiest way to learn notes is to get a few basic ones down and then learn to play a song using them. , You want your hands to be turned sideways over your home keys. Make sure that your pinky fingers are the ones closest to the piano. The idea is that the movements or your hands will imitate a chopping motion in someways. That’s why it’s called chopsticks! For example, imagine that you were almost karate chopping the piano keys.

, Put your left pinky on the D key, and your right pinky on the B key, as shown in the accompanying picture. This is the next part of the song and slightly more complex, since you’ll need to move both fingers at the same time. Take your time and practice.

, Once again, with the same rhythm, play the notes six times. Stick to the tic-tock rhythm as you play or it won’t sound right.

, This time, they both go on the note ""C"", one octave apart. If you’re lost, refer back to where the notes on the piano are. This will help you reorient yourself. , After you play those four notes, you still have 2 left in your rhythm! Remember that you’re counting to six.

Decide the root note.T he root note is the LOWEST note of the chord,the note you would like to build upon, like a foundation for a house.,
After choosing the root note, choose the 3rd note and 5th note by counting from the root note.For example, if C is the root note,the 3rd note is C,D,E.And the 5th note is C,D,E,F,G.

,
After getting the root(1st note),3rd note and 5th note,(if you know how to write notes) you can write them down ONE ON TOP OF THE OTHER because the three notes are played at the same time.,
In a major chord, the MAJOR 3rd is used(5 frets higher on a guitar counting from a root note).",How to Play a Root Position Piano Chord,";

Learn how to read sheet music.,
Make sure that you have proper posture and develop a good playing technique.",How to Play Classical Piano1," As a classical pianist you will rely heavily on your books filled with classical masterpieces from all manner of famous or lesser known composers. It is a general belief and unwritten rule that when you play a classical piece you want to stay true to its composer's intent, so it is very important that you don't rely on your ear to learn a classical piece, because it is extremely unlikely that you will be able to pick out every note played by a pianist performing the piece you aim to learn. Due to this, playing classical music and being able to read sheet music goes hand in hand.

, This is especially important for fast and technically challenging pieces that require dexterity, control and endurance. The easiest way to do this is to have a teacher than can give you professional tips and ideas to help you find a technique that works well for you.


Relax your shoulders and don't tense your forearms.
Use your arm weight. Rather than just pressing the keys using your fingers, relax your arms and use the joints in your fingers to keep your wrists straight. Remember that your forearms should not have tension in them while playing. The weight of your arms should be able to rest on your fingers.
Try having your hands rest on your knees or thighs while sitting down. This is the same relaxation you should feel playing the piano. Gravity is your friend.
Watch videos of acknowledged skilled pianists to get inspiration. Ask a teacher or friends with knowledge in the area for pianists with excellent technique.

Realize the challenge behind playing well quickly.,
Be harsh on yourself.,
Practice crossing your fingers evenly.,
Don't go faster than you can handle.,
Follow the notated fingering, if any.",How to Play Classical Piano2," If you listen to professional pianists that play, for example, Mozart's Piano Sonata No. 16 in C major or a fugue by Bach, generally make it sound extremely simple, but it is far from it. While you can learn a piano sonata or sonatina fairly quickly, as they generally may not be that complex, the big challenge comes in playing them well. It is very common for sonatas to have a lot of fast scales going up and down, and these are difficult to play evenly and precise. Because of this, proper technique is extremely important.;
, If you're playing a quick piano piece, listen carefully to what you're playing. If you find it difficult to listen and play simultaneously, record yourself. Listen for areas where quick sixteenth notes weren't completely even, or where you pressed a key much harder than the rest making it stand out even though it shouldn't. If you have a teacher, he or she will pick up on this. Know where you need to improve and of course listen to your teacher.

, One of the most difficult things to do quickly and evenly is crossing fingers over each other, for example: thumb under middle or ring finger, or ring finger over thumb. Practice these kinds of transitions slowly. The general idea is that if you have to for example cross the thumb under your ring finger, your thumb should be in contact with the key that it is going to press when you're pressing your ring finger down on its own key. Once you press down your thumb, your other fingers have to quickly go back over the thumb and be ready at their next keys to press. Doing this flawlessly will help those quick scales to be played smoothly and evenly. Ask for help from your teacher or look up instructional videos to help you on your way if you get stuck.

, This is very important; never start playing a fast piece in its intended tempo. You will have to stop continuously and correct yourself often, and that is detrimental. Start slowly, using a metronome can help to make sure you don't increase the tempo unwillingly. Starting slow and then gradually increasing the tempo will make sure that once you get up to a satisfactory speed, you will still have control of what you're playing. But don't be too ambitious and increase the tempo too quickly. If you increase too much you will start making mistakes again while playing. If you do this, go back down to a manageable tempo. Practising fast pieces requires patience and discipline, but once you finally get it up to speed, they will be all the more fun to play if you've practised well.

, Many pieces will have fingerings written down to help you play the piece efficiently, and while they will not always make sense and seem strange, try using them anyway and they might make more sense once you get familiar and comfortable with the piece. Fingerings have often been picked out and suggested by professional pianists, but simultaneously, different editions and translations of the same piece can have different fingerings suggested. If all else fails and you really cannot make a suggested fingering work, then it is okay to create your own that fits you better. Every pianist is different.

Learn the piece while playing it with a strict tempo.,
Make your own interpretation.,
Make sure the melody stands out.",How to Play Classical Piano3," A lot of romantic pieces will allow for expressive tempo changes, ritardandos and accelerandos, but your first priority should be to learn the piece while playing with a strict and constant tempo.

, Once you're comfortable with a piece and know how to play it, you can add ritardandos, accelerandos, crescendos and diminuendos where you see fit. There is no right or wrong here. A lot of the time things like this will be written down in the sheet music to guide you, but it is up to you to what degree you want to do each expressive ""suggestion"". Look up different recordings of, for instance, Debussy's La fille aux cheveux de lin and you will notice that no recording is the same. That's because each pianist has made their own interpretation of it. You can use recordings as inspiration, but ultimately it can be more fun to create your own idea of the piece, and to tell your own story while playing it. This might even attach you to the piece on an emotional level so that it is more than a mere piece of paper with notes written on it. When people watch you play it they will feel that personal energy flowing through your fingers into the piano keys.

, Romantic pieces usually have a lot of chords and notes played at the same time, but in the end only one of those will be the melody. If you're not careful that melody will be lost in the cluster of tones created by the chords. Always make sure that you can make out the melody while playing. You should be able to sing along with it (in your head). To do this, make sure that you put more of your arm's weight on the finger(s) playing the melody. It can also help to do your best to play the melody with legato unless otherwise instructed by the sheet music. This can be difficult when playing chords at the same time, but a lot of the time the sheet music will have suggestions for fingerings that can help you on your way. If not, try to figure out your own, or ask your teacher or a friend for help.

Find the key and accompanying chords.,
Play the root of each chord with your left hand.,
Invert the chords.,
Hop octaves.,
Combine these approaches.,
Experiment with more complex basslines.,
Insert other chords in the same key (optional).,
Adjust to your genre.",How to Play Bassline when Playing the Piano," Determine which key the piece is in, and learn the basic chords for each key signature. In a major key, the one, four, and five chords are always major, and together they make a common chord progression. For example, in the key of C major, you can play the C major, F major, and G major chords.
, The root of the chord is the note the chord is named after. Play this note with your left hand on any lower octave as you play the rest of the chord with your right. For example, cycle through the C major, F major, and G major chords in order, playing the C, F, and G on a lower octave with your left hand.

You can play the root note on your right hand as well, if you like.

, This just means playing a different note of the chord in the bassline. So instead of playing the C in a C major chord with your left hand, play the E as you play the C and G with your right. Try play the same chord progression (C, F, G) as you alter which notes are played on the bass. Now you're changing the melody and the bassline at the same time. Here's as an example of a simple chord progression, with the steadily rising bassline in bold:


C / E G

D / G B

E / C G

F / A C

G / B D

C / E G
If you like, you can play the F an octave lower.

, So far, you've stuck to a walking bassline, meaning it changes on each beat. Now try a bassline with some rests, and that covers more than one octave. Here's another example in the key of C with four beats per measure. Once again, the bassline is in bold:


low C / E G (hold chord for two beats)

C one octave higher / E G

low C' / E G
repeat this pattern in second measure with G / B D
repeat with F / A C

, Combine the chord progression and the change in rhythm to construct more variations with the same basic tools. Here's a simple combination of the examples above:


C / E G (hold for two beats)

D / G B

E / C G

, Here's a progression that emphasizes the bass line:

Play a C chord (C E G) on each beat of the measure, or hold it down.
Play C, D, D#, E with your left hand sequentially.

, If you'd like to make your bassline a bit less predictable, throw in a chord that belongs in the same key. Sticking with the key of C, try adding an A minor chord: A + C♮+ E., Each genre has its own rules of music theory, and traditional ways to construct basslines. There's a lot more you can learn by listening closely to songs and talking to other musicians.

Try a simple experiment emphasizing different beats of the bassline to see how it affects the piece. Classical piano basslines tend to emphasize the second and fourth beat of a 4/4 measure, while rock music and rhythm & blues emphasize the first and second beat. In triple time signatures such as 3/4, the first beat is usually emphasized.

Trace the shape of the pad on your rubber sheet.,
Cut the rubber to fit your practice pad using a precision blade.,
Liberally apply strong glue to the top of the plywood.,
Press the mouse pad onto the wood and leave it to dry for 1-2 hours.,
Make the pad thicker and quieter by covering the top in duct tape.,
Use a mouse pad to practice your rudiments anywhere in the house.,
Use pillows to focus on stick control and speed without the benefit of a rebound.,
Cover hard surfaces with 2-3 sweaters or pieces of fabric for a quick, quiet playing surface.,
Try hitting on an old basketball.,
Play on your own thigh.",How to Make Your Own Drum Practice Pad," You have several options, depending on your style and needs. Thinner rubber, around 1/8"", is generally the standard thickness. But you can go thicker for a quieter, less bouncy practice surface. Usually, you'll need to buy a sheet of gum rubber online, which will allow you to choose your thickness and length. If, however, you cannot get a hold of rubber, you can try out:

An old mouse pad.

Foam rubber

Rubber soles from old shoes

1/2"" thick cork board.;
, Make sure there are no cracks or splinters in the wood before beginning. You can make the pad in any shape you want -- circular, square, oblong-- as long as you have enough room to practice. While sawing unique pads let you choose the shape, you can also cut the rubber, not the wood, to fit a bit of pre-existing wood if you already have a usable slab of plywood or pine.

If you're cutting the pad to a pre-existing shape, like a mouse pad, trace the shape of rubber on the wood and then cut to that.

You don't have to use plywood, though it is easily worked and light enough to carry around. Any wood will do.


, Using the roughest sandpaper you can find, sand the corners of the wood so that the edges are rounded. Take your time with the center of the pad as well, making sure it is smoothed over without splinters or jagged bumps.

You don't want the wood to rip up your rubber pad, forcing you to build a new one.


, Whatever you're using for rubber, lay it down flat and place your plywood on top. Trace out the shape of the plywood on the rubber.
, An X-acto knife, box cutter, or another precision knife can be used to finely cut the rubber into the right shape. Work slowly, pulling the knife in one long, fluid motion, not sawing with it.
, You want superglue, Gorilla glue, Krazy glue, or some other multi-surface adhesive. Make sure to read the bottle to ensure it sticks to both rubber and wood (or whatever other surface, like fabric, is on your pad. Generously apply a thin line of glue across the entire surface of the pad, stopping roughly 1/4"" away from the edges.
, Do not go any further until the glue is completely dry.
, If you want to make a thicker pad, wrap the whole thing carefully in tape. Go slowly, overlapping the lines of tape carefully so that they don't wrinkle and bunch up, ruining your playing surface., A mouse pad, usually  between 1/4−1/2{\displaystyle 1/4-1/2} inches thick, can be used to practice sticking on just about any hard service. While you can't work on fills or drum solos, you can work on essential rhythms, your stick speed, and control.

You want the fabric coated pads, not the plastic ones.

Glue two pads together and to make a quick practice pad that you can bring anywhere., A pillow has none of the pop of an actually drum set -- when you hit the stick down, it will stay there until you pick it back up. But this can actually be a good thing, forcing you to focus on your technique and wrist movement with every hit. You might not be able to practice drum rolls, but your stick control will go way up, as will speed and strength.

It will take time, but world-famous drummers like Tony Royster Jr. are blazing fast because they the grew up practicing on pillows., The tighter you can stretch the fabric across the surface, the better. All you really need for a practice pad is a soft, slightly rebounding surface -- so hit blankets, sweaters, old shirts, and comforters.

You can, with some patience, even wrap these around your actual drum heads, pots, or pans, allowing you to quietly ""play"" your kit.

In time you're more than likely to rip the fabric to shreds. Use old or discarded sheets and clothing that you no longer car for.


, While the rounded surface takes getting used to, it forces you to aim accurately when landing the stick. You can also add or leak out air to make drumming easier or harder. Less air will require more wrist strength, much like playing on a pillow., It will take some getting used to, but your legs have good rebound for your sticks. And they come with you everywhere. If you're looking to be the best drummer you can be, you need to practice all the time. Your thighs may be just the place in a pinch."

Gather your equipment.,
Set up the ""drums"".,
Fill the cymbals with rice.,
Glue the drums in place.,
Grab your drumsticks and have fun.",How to Make Drums Using Paint Cans," To make this drum kit, you will need a cardboard box, three small paint cans and two large paint cans. Try to make the large paint cans tall rather than wide. If you can't find any tall paint cans, make the small paint cans much shorter. Make sure they're not too short though or it won't make any sound. Also, the cardboard box needs to fit all five paint cans on like the picture below.;
, To set up the drums, put the three short paint cans (black circles) in a row towards the bottom of the cardboard box. These will represent the snare drum, mid tom and floor tom. Next, put the two tall paint cans (red circles) in between paint cans one and two, and two and three. These will represent the high hat and another cymbal such as a crash, splash or ride.

, When you strike the drums, the rice will rattle inside making it sound like a cymbal. Put about an eighth of rice in the high-hat cymbal can and about a quarter of rice in the other cymbal paint can. Other things you can fill the drum with include broken up spaghetti, crushed pasta and something similar. Make sure the spaghetti or pasta is uncooked otherwise it will go bad and smell/sound awful

, To glue the drums in place, put a layer of hot glue (yellow line) on the edge of the drum. Be sure to take the lids off the drums before gluing them so the sound echos better once you're finished. Also, using hot glue will secure the drums fully to the box whereas any other glue might come off after time. If you don't have hot glue, use other glue at your own risk.

, Be sure not to bang too hard otherwise the drums will crack. If they do crack, tape them up with duct tape to repair them.

Cut off the mouthpiece of the balloon.,
Stretch the balloon on the pot and secure it.,
Play your drum.",How to Make Drums for Kids1," Find an old pot to use as the body of the drum. A pot with a diameter of less than 12 inches works best.;
, The balloon is going to be the head of the drum so it needs to be tight but large enough to fit around the top of the pot. If the balloon is too small, it might be too tight ad break when you drum.A 24 inch balloon works best for pots 10 to 12 inches in diameter.
A 16 inch balloon works best for pots under 10 inches in diameter.

, Use scissors to cut the mouthpiece off of the balloon. Make sure you only cut the mouth piece and not the body of the balloon.







, Secure the pot in between your knees or ask a friend to hold it securely. Put the balloon over one side of the pot and carefully stretch it over the entire top of the pot. Secure the balloon on the pot by stretching several rubber bands onto the pot sitting on top of the balloon.







, Use lightweight wooden sticks to play your balloon drum. Chopsticks, small wooden dowels, or pencils work great for drumming on a balloon drum.

Glue the construction paper onto the coffee tin using craft glue.If you can't use the label as a guide, use a ruler to measure the width of label area on the tin. Draw a rectangle on the construction paper that is the same width and as long as the piece of paper is. You can cut off any overlap.

, Use a hot glue gun to glue a square of fabric to the top of the coffee tin. Trim the excess fabric leaving about one to two inches of extra fabric past the glue.The square of fabric should be about double the size of the top of the tin. For example, if the lid of the tin is about 3x3 inches, the fabric square should be 6x6 inches.

, Put the lid to the coffee tin back on to secure the fabric in place and create a solid surface for the child to drum on. You can hide the edge of the lid by gluing on a ribbon over it.

, Use markers, stickers, feathers, or other decorative material to decorate the drum. You can draw designs on the paper around the drum or hang feathers down from the lid to the coffee tin.

The carpet tube should be three to four inches in diameter.
The bottom of the flower pot should be four inches in diameter.

, You need thick, pliable plastic material to make the head of this drum. A beach ball works perfect, but any thick and flexible plastic material will work.


A balloon is too thin.

, Use scissors or a small hand saw to cut the carpet tube to be 12 inches long. Make sure you cut the tube straight and not at an angle so it will attach flat to the flower pot.

, Start by using scissors to cut the plastic blow tube off of the beach ball, and then cut the ball open so it can lay out flat. Cut a square out of the beach ball that is as wide as the beach ball is. This will give you enough to cover the top of the flower pot and have extra around the sides.

, Get an embroidery hoop the size of the top of the flower pot. Take apart the embroidery hoop and stretch the beach ball square onto the bottom of the embroidery hoop, stretching as you go. Put the top of the embroidery hoop back on the bottom, and make sure the beach ball is very tight in the hoop.This is the drum head

, Put the drum head on the top of the flower pot and secure it using packing tape. Use enough tape to securely fasten the drum head to the flower pot.

, Set the flower pot onto the top of the cardboard tube. Use packing tape to secure the flower pot onto the cardboard tube.

Gather your supplies.,
Glue the cups together.,
Cover the cups in masking tape.,
Add shoe polish.",How to Make an African Drum1," You can make a simple African drum using disposable cups. This is an easy and non-messy activity that is great for very young children. First, you'll need to gather the necessary supplies.


You'll need Styrofoam, paper, or plastic drinking cups. You can wash used disposable drinking cups and use them for crafts.You will also need glue, masking tape, shoe polish, a paint brush, rags, and permanent markers.;
, The first step is to glue the cups together. Apply a generous amount of glue to the bottom of each cup. Stick the bottoms together, hold until secure, and then let dry.If you're doing this activity with kids, they should be able to manage this step on their own. However, if you're working with a large group of children it may be easier to prepare the cups yourself ahead of time. Young kids especially may be impatient waiting for their cups to dry and want to hurry into to the decorating process., Once you have the cups prepared, cover them in masking tape. This creates a surface on which children can color and decorate the cups.


Use strips of masking tape 4 to 5 inches in length. If you're doing this activity with kids, you can allow them to tear off their own masking tape.Coat the drum in small strips of masking tape, overlapping as needed so the whole drum is covered in a layer of tape., Now, you'll add the shoe polish. This will give your project a color similar to a traditional African drum. Use your paintbrush to brush a layer of shoe polish over the masking tape. Then, take a clean rag and wipe off excess polish. Allow the drums to sit until they're dry to the touch before use.If you're working with kids, use your judgement regarding shoe polish. If you feel your kids are old enough to handle applying it on their own, allow them to do so with supervision. Very young children, however, may make a mess when using shoe polish.
If you decide to let your kids apply the polish alone, have them wear old clothing or provide them with smocks. Shoe polish can smear easily.

Get together the essential elements.,
Prepare the board.,
Fasten the cookie or cake tin to the stick with screws, about two feet from the bottom.

,
Fasten the wire at the top and bottom with eye screws, which go across the cookie tin, and tighten these with a turnbuckle.

,
Bolt a bracket onto the cookie tin, and fasten a piece of bent coat hanger at one end of the wire, with the other end resting lightly against the cookie tin.

,
Create a threaded wooden rod, about 2 1⁄2 feet (0.8 m) long which is drawn like a bow across the braided bailing wire.

,
Attach other sound-making items.",How to Make a Pogo Cello," They are listed in the ""Things You'll Need"".;
, Fasten a bolt to the back of the board at the bottom with two eye screws. Surround this bolt with an outward-coiling spring. When you bang the board on a wooden stage or other hard surface this contraption helps it to make a thumping, bass sound. You don't lift it up - it springs up on its own --like bouncing pogo stick - hence the name ""pogo cello.""

,,,,, Many interesting things can be attached to the stick to give some percussive variations : tin can lids, jingle bells, bottle caps, a cow bell, a wood block, perhaps a tambourine.

For the container, you can use a coffee container, a popcorn tin, or an aluminum can. This is going to be the base of the drum, so look for a container that is clean and in good condition.;
, This is going to form the top of the drum, which needs to be sturdy and firm.


Try to put at least one to two layers of tape on the top of the can and criss-cross the tape tightly to make the drum more durable.

, Then, cut the construction paper so it will fit around the container snugly. Tape the paper in place and trim away the excess paper.

, Or, let your little one decorate the drum using markers, crayons, or paint.


You can also cut out shapes from other construction paper and attach them onto the side of the drum.

, Crumple up a piece of tissue paper on the end of a pencil. Wrap masking tape or electrical tape around the tissue ball so it is secured to the pencil.


Repeat this method on another pencil.

, Now it is time to have some fun with your drum or let your toddler play with it to make sure it will withstand a drumming session.

The most important and final step is, Tune it !",How to Build a Drum Set," Before buying any parts or putting anything together, make a complete plan for your kit.

First, decide how many drums you want, along with the depth and diameter of each drum. At the least, you will want a snare drum and a bass drum, but adding a few toms will round out your kit.
You will also need to decide on the color of your drums' shells and hardware, and the wood used for the shells. Maple, birch, and beech are all common choices for drum shells. You will need to decide on how any toms will be mounted; if you mount any toms to the bass drum, you will need the appropriate hardware to do so.;
,,,, Tighten it to the ground.

, (There's a hole that will guide you on where you will insert the toms).

, Half of the edge of the snare must be exposed and the other part is hidden at the back of the bass. Place also the floor tom at the right side counter-parting the snare drum.

, The crash and the hi-hat cymbals will be on the left side and the rest is on the right area including the ride, china and crash-ride cymbals.

Gather your supplies.,
Make a zig-zag pattern around your terra cotta pot using twine.,
Add the top of the drum.,
Paint the plastic container.,
Create the base of the drum.",How to Make an African Drum2," For a sturdier drum, you can use a garden pot or planter pot. This activity requires a bit more skill. It might be fun to use with slightly older children. To begin, gather the necessary supplies.


You will need a garden pot or planer made with a terra-cotta covering. It should have a seven inch diameter. You should be able to find this at a local gardening or craft shop.You will need a plastic lid big enough to fit over the pot. You can use a disposable food storage lid.You will also need another lid that goes with a sturdy plastic container. The pot should be able to sit comfortably on this container. You can buy a plastic container at a local craft shop. However, you can also use a deli container or a takeout container for soup.You will also need dry beans, twine or string, medium weight twine, a glue gun, craft glue, and brown acrylic paint., To start, loop the twine around the planter in a zig-zag pattern. To do this, use the glue gun to add a dab of glue to the top and bottom of the string on the points forming the zig-zag. Press down on the string for a few seconds after applying glue to make sure it stays in place.If you're working with a child, help him during this process. It can be helpful to show him zig-zag patterns online to get a sense of what he should be creating. A child should not operate a glue gun without supervision. If your child is very young, it's best to operate the glue gun yourself.

, Once the zig-zag pattern is created, you can add the top of the drum. To do this, you'll need your plastic lid.


Apply a thin line of glue running along the rim of the storage container lid. You can have your child do this as well, with your supervision.Press the lid onto the top of the planter. Hold for a few seconds., The plastic container will form the bottom of your drum. This should be painted brown to match the pot. You can have your child paint the container or you can do so yourself if your child is too young. Allow the container to dry completely before continuing. How long the drying process takes depends on how much paint you used and the specific brand., Once the paint is dry, you can create the base of your drum. To start, apply glue to the bottom of the planter. Use a generous amount. Press the bottom of the plastic container against the bottom of the planter. Hold until secure.From here, fill the container at the bottom with dry beans. this will weigh down the drum, allowing it to be more stable when played. Seal the container with the lid when you're finished."

Learn about the appearance of a Djembe drum.,
Familiarize yourself with symbolic decorations.,
Provide markers and paint.,
Use stickers.,
Consider construction paper.,
Throw in other craft supplies.",How to Make an African Drum3," A Djembe drum is typically goblet shaped. The top is usually made with goatskin and traditionally made from wood. Ropes usually tie the goatskin in place, holding it down in a somewhat zig-zag pattern. The shoe polish on the cup design and the terra cotta pot and painted containers in the pot design both imitate the wood covering of a Djembe drum. If you did the terra cotta design, you'll already have made some zig-zags. If you're using cups, you can draw or paint on zig-zags to mimic an authentic design. This will get you started in terms of making realistic designs., There are certain carvings you may find on traditional African drums. These can represent different aspects of life and culture in different parts of Africa. You can try adding such designs using stickers, paint, or other craft supplies to make your project more authentic.


Various animals may represent different things on a drum. A crocodile is considered one of the first creatures on earth in some African cultures, for example. A python is often associate with divination and fortune telling. Chickens can represent possibility and sacrifice. Fish can represent wealth and happiness.A padlock can represent power and control. Some occupations also hold significance. Drawing a blacksmith, or a blacksmith's tools, on your drum can symbolize transformation or fire.Keep in mind symbolism varies from culture to culture. You might want to get a sense of how symbolism is used and then use symbols from your own personal life and culture on your drums. For example, if a particular animal has special symbolism to you, you could put that on your drum.

, You can add decorations by simply using paint and markers. This may be the simplest option when working with young children.


Both masking tape and terra-cotta are easy to paint or draw on with markers. With the terra-cotta project, beads of glue from the zig-zagging process may be visible. These can be covered up with the use of paint or markers.When working with children, provide smocks or have your kids wear old clothing. Paint and markers can get messy.

, If you're doing any of the above projects with very young children, consider providing them with stickers. These may be easier to use. Look for African-themed stickers, such as stickers featuring animals you would find in the region. You may be able to find stickers involving countries from Africa online. These can help make the project educational.

, Construction paper can also be a fun addition to an African drum project. You can have your kids cut the paper into shapes and glue them onto their pots or cups. Construction paper can make a variety of fun patterns that can be added to the African drums.

, You can stop by a local craft store and pick up things like beads, feathers, puff balls, pipe cleaners, and other fun craft accessories. If you're working with young children, they'll have fun gluing such supplies to their drums. Young kids often appreciate getting a little zany or silly for their projects. Don't be afraid to think outside the box by providing a medley of fun craft supplies.

Lay another balloon flat on a hard surface.,
Stretch the cut up balloon on top of the balloon on the can.,
Wrap tape around the can to secure the balloons.,
Try out the drums.",How to Make a Homemade Drum2," For this method, you will need a clean round container like a coffee can or formula can, balloons, electrical tape or masking tape, and rubber bands (optional)., Use your fingers to open the balloon up and expand it so it fits over the top of the can.

, Do not blow it up, you want to use a limp balloon. Using the scissors, cut small holes into the balloon. They do not need to be uniform or perfect, as they are more for decoration.

, Double layering the balloons will make the drum more durable, and the holes in top layer will add a fun decorative effect.

, You can also use rubber bands and simply place them around the can to keep the balloons attached.

Gather your materials.,
Cut the can and bottles.,
Trace the can openings.,
Heat the plastic.,
Heat the flat head.,
Done!",How to Make a Drum2," You'll need a heat gun or torch, a sharp box cutter, a metal can, and PETE plastic. That's it!


PETE plastic will be labeled on the bottom of plastic items, usually next to the recycle number (which will be a 1). Disposable water bottles are usually made of PETE, as are many cheap juice containers.

, Cut both ends off of the metal can and the plastic bottles. You will then want to cut a single line in the tube of the plastic bottles so that they can be flattened out. A single hole made with a nail in the side of the can is also necessary. Anywhere on the side will work.

, Trace the opening hole of the can onto the rolled out piece of plastic using a marker. Leave at least half an inch of extra space all around the can as you trace the line, since the plastic needs to be bigger than the opening. Cut out the pieces when you're done.

, Place the circle of plastic down on a surface that can be exposed to high heat and then place the can down on top of it. Apply the heat evenly around the edges of the bottom of the can and you will see the plastic shrink up to grip the sides of the can.


If you see the edges turn white, you're over-heating it.

, The ends of your drum should now be covered. If you used ridged plastic, you'll need to apply the heat over the surface in order to smooth it out but it will become completely smooth. If you used smooth plastic you still need to apply a small amount of heat to the head to get it nice and tight and get the proper sound.

, Enjoy your new drum.

Done!",How to Make a Drum3," You need something to act as the drum body. If you want a temporary solution because you're making the drum for a small child, use something like a metal soup pot (two handles instead of a one handled saucepan). If you want a drum for an older child or something that your child can have for a longer period of time, you can use PVC pipe or a cardboard shipping tube (both will need to be cut to size).

, You'll need balloons in a few different sizes, because the opening of your drum body will be different and you don't know what will really make the best sound until you try it. Once you have the balloons, cut off the necks., Stretch the balloon over the opening of the pot or drum body. This will probably be challenging, but don't give up. Try different balloons to get different sounds during this part of the process.

, Using a strong tape, like duct tape, tape the edges of the balloon to the side of the drum, helping to hold it in place. Make sure there are no air leaks.

Learn what numbers correspond with what fingers. The chromatic scale uses a unique fingering pattern. It differs from many other typical scale patterns in many ways, mainly because it only uses three of the five fingers.
Remember the names of each note of the scale. The chromatic scale contains twelve pitches, each a semitone above or below another. ""A semitone, also called a half step or a half tone, is the smallest musical interval commonly used in Western tonal music, and it is considered the most dissonant when sounded harmonically. It is defined as the interval between two adjacent notes in a 12-tone scale (e.g. from C to C♯)"". It contains every tone between any one note and the same note an octave apart. We will start and end on C, but there is only one chromatic scale. No matter where you start, the fingering will be the same.;
,


Play the first note (C) with your index finger (finger 1).

Replace the drum heads on your drum set with a different kind.,
Update your drum hardware.,
Add new drums or cymbals to your drum set.,
Refinish your drum shells.",How to Customize a Drum Set," Swapping out drum heads is an easy and inexpensive way to customize the look, feel, and tone of your drum set. Drum heads are manufactured in a wide range of materials and thicknesses, from the ubiquitous clear or coated mylar heads, to exotic faux calfskin heads, to special colored drum heads.


Note that new drum heads should not be chosen on appearance alone, as they will also impact the tone of your kit. Warm, dark calfskin heads are not ideal for playing hard rock, for instance.
If you use black or colored drum heads, the colored coating will gradually rub off onto your drum sticks. This coating can deposit onto drum heads that are white or clear, so avoid using your drum sticks on another drummer's kit.;
, Another way to dramatically alter the appearance of your drum set is by changing the hardware. Lugs, hoops, tension rods, tom mounts, snare strainers, and leg brackets are all available in a range of different finishes from major drum manufacturers.


Gold, chrome, white, and black finishes are the most common available. Some parts, such as drum hoops, can be made from wood as well.
If you are operating on a budget, you can try refinishing your current hardware. Metal-safe spray paints and bronzing dips are 2 methods you can use to give your hardware a fresh appearance.

, Of course, most drum sets feature the same standard 4-piece or 5-piece arrangement of snare, toms, and bass drum. To customize a drum set and make it more unique, you can add elements that aren't included in this arrangement.


For instance, you can add a second snare drum to your kit. A snare drum with a smaller diameter or depth (often called a piccolo snare) can be placed next to your existing snare to provide you with a new range of tonal opportunities.
You can also add additional toms. For example, adding an 18 inch (45 cm) floor tom to the right of an existing 16 inch (40 cm) floor tom will allow you to achieve a new depth of pitch with your toms.

, Updating the appearance of your drum shells is perhaps the most dramatic way to customize a drum set. Drum shells are finished either using wood stain, paint, or a wrap finish that is glued to the wood shell.


Refinishing drum shells is not, however, a job suited for amateurs. Attempting to remove an existing finish carries the risk of damaging your drums. Always have your drums professionally refinished unless you have experience working with drum finishes.
Because the drum hardware will need to be completely removed to refinish the drum shells, consider updating the hardware as well to coordinate with the new finish.

Turn it on and set the volume.,
Choose the sound you want to play, if desired.,
Consult your manual to learn keyboard features.,
Record yourself to improve your playing.",How to Play a Casio Keyboard (Beginners)1," The position of the power button will depend on your model. Usually you’ll find this button on the left or right side, in one of the corners of the keyboard. Volume knobs or buttons are usually labeled and are positioned off to the left or right as well.

Many Casio keyboards have a small LED near the power button. When the keyboard is on, this light turns on to indicate it has power.If your keyboard isn’t turning on, check the power cord. The keyboard won’t turn on if it’s unplugged or the cord is loose.
If your keyboard is battery powered and it won’t start up, you may need new batteries. Replace these and see if the keyboard turns on.;
, The default for most keyboards when they’re first turned on is piano, but electronic keyboards can synthesize many different sounds. Use the number pad (usually to the right) to change the sounds made when you press a key.

Most keyboards will have an instrument directory written somewhere near the keypad. This will list instrument names (like organ, trumpet, and so on) and their number.If your keyboard doesn’t have an instrument directory, look up the instrument numbers in your manual. If your manual is missing, Casio offers free electronic manuals online., The features your Casio has will largely depend on its model. Older keyboards may have few features, but newer ones may have programmed lessons, auto-chord features, a metronome, and more.


Programmed lessons often make use of a keyboard light-up feature, where keys change color to indicate which you’re supposed to press to play a song.
Auto-chord features will make simple chords off a single note. This can be a fun way to learn simple chord structure.

, Especially in the beginning, you’ll be focused on hitting the right notes, hand position, and so on. You’ll be coordinating a lot of new motions, so it may be difficult to get a good sense of how it all sounds together without listening to a recording.


The record button on most Casios is red and will be labeled with ""Rec.” Generally, press this button once to start recording and again to stop.
Recording features will vary from model to model. Your keyboard may even have memory so you can save songs you’re really proud of."

Familiarize yourself with the names of the keys.,
Recognize fingering notation.,
Sit at the keyboard with good posture.,
Keep your hands relaxed and press the keys smoothly.,
Read musical notes in piano sheet music.,
Play an octave scale with your right hand.,
Follow up your right-hand scale with one using your left.",How to Play a Casio Keyboard (Beginners)2," Keys are named after the musical notes they represent. Musical notes use letters from A to G. Each white key is called by a single letter name, with letters repeating every eight white keys.


Moving up the keyboard, the next white note after G is A, but then the pattern continues normally (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, A, B…) and vice versa when moving down.
One of the easiest notes on the keyboard to locate is C. Look for a grouping of two black keys (there will probably be several). The white key to the immediate left of these black keys is always C.
The C at the center of the keyboard is called middle C. The C directly above is high C, and the C directly below low C. This pattern holds for other notes, too.

, As a beginner, you might not know which finger to use to play a note. This is why fingering notation is included with many beginner songs. Numbers above notes correspond to the finger you should use to play, as follows:

1 represents your thumb.
2 represents your pointer finger.
3 represents your middle finger.
4 represents your ring finger.
5 represents your pinkie., It’s no joke, the better your posture is, the better your playing will sound. Good posture allows you to use your full body when sitting at the keys, which will create a fuller, richer sound.

Keep your back and neck straight and in alignment. It may help you improve slouching if you set up a mirror to the side of your keyboard.You should be sitting high enough that your elbow and upper arm hang freely from your shoulder with your forearm parallel to the floor.
Adjust your distance from the keyboard so that your elbows are a little in front of the center line of your body when playing., When resting fingers on the keys, hold your wrists so they are level with your hands and relaxed. Your fingers should be slightly curled. Press keys with a soft, fluid motion, similar to how a cat kneads.Some keyboards may not change volume when keys are pressed soft or hard. This feature is generally referred to as “key action” or “weighted keys.”Even if your keyboard doesn’t have action, you should practice proper key attack anyways. This way, when you sit down at a keyboard with weighted keys, you’ll still sound great.

, Keyboard music is generally represented with two sets of five lines. The top set represents notes played by your right hand and the bottom your left. Each line and space for each of these sets represents a note.

In most beginner music, the leftmost area of the top set of lines will have a symbol that looks like an “&” sign. This is called a treble clef. Similarly, the bottom is usually marked with a backwards “C” and called the bass clef.
Treble clef lines, from bottom to top, are E, G, B, D, and F. Starting again from the bottom, spaces represent the notes F, A, C, and E.Bass clef lines are G, B, D, F, and A, starting from the bottommost line. Moving up from the bottom space, the notes are: A, C, E, and G., It’s time to put all these basic skills together and play something. An octave is a span of eight notes on the keyboard, and you’re going to scale up this distance on the keyboard. Middle C is a good central note to start your scale:

Spread your fingers so each is on a single key, with your thumb on middle C.
Press the keys smoothly. When you release one key, follow with the next white key up.
When you reach the third note up (E), tuck your thumb under to play the next white key (F).
Scale up, pressing notes until you reach your pinkie (high C).
Move down from high C. At your thumb (F), cross your middle finger over to the next key (E).
Finish the scale at middle C., For this scale, you’re going to start a little lower on the keyboard. Find the C right below middle C (low C). Remember you can find C notes easily on a keyboard by looking for groupings of two black keys. To scale with your left hand:

Arrange your fingers one finger per key, with your pinkie starting on low C.
Scale up, pressing keys one at a time until your reach your thumb (G).
Cross your middle finger over your thumb to play the next white note (A).
Stop scaling up at your thumb (middle C), then move down one white note at a time.
At your third finger (A), tuck your thumb under to play the next white key (G).
Scale down until you end at your pinkie (low C)."

Coordinating the motions of two different hands, even when those motions are similar like in this song, can be difficult. Sing along to help your rhythm.It may be too difficult at first to play both hands together. Even talented pianists practice difficult music by playing hands separately, when necessary.

, Each syllable of this song will get a single note in each hand. In the following, a forward slash ( / ) represents syllable breaks. So the first phrase is broken up: twin / kle / twin / kle / lit / tle / star. The notes in both hands are: C / C / G / G / A / A / G

Try a stick flip.",How to Bucket Drum," The key component of your bucket drum set is going to be the bucket. A 15 liter (4 US gal) bucket is usually a good size for someone of an average height. You can find large plastic buckets at hardware stores or by asking friends or family if they have an empty plastic bucket you can use.You will also need a stool or another bucket of equal or lesser height that you can sit on when you drum.;
, The second key component of your bucket drum set is a pair of wooden drumsticks. Look for drumsticks at your local music supply store or online.You can also use metal drumsticks, but they are often heavier and more difficult to use for beginner drummers.

, If you plan to move around with your bucket drum set, you can make it portable by making a strap for the bucket drum out of duct tape and rope.Begin by wrapping duct tape around the bucket, a few inches from the bottom of the bucket. Wrap the duct tape around once and then once more again. At the end of the second layer of tape, pinch one inch of the tape to make a loop.
Continue wrapping the tape once you make the first loop for five to ten inches and then pinch the tape again to create a second loop. A wider gap between the loops works best if you want to tie the bucket around your waist. A narrower gap between the loops works best if you plan to carry the bucket via a shoulder strap.
Wrap the tape around the bucket one more time, layering over the loops so they are double layered. This will make them strong enough to withstand the pull of the rope.
Turn the bucket upside down, with the opening on the ground. Then, put duct tape on the bucket vertically over the wrapped section to secure it further. Do this three to four times.
Thread the rope through the loops and tie the bucket to your waist or make a shoulder strap with the rope and carry the bucket that way.

, If you are new to playing drums, it is important that you learn the three elements of a basic drum beat: the bass, the snare, and the hi-hat. These three elements can be played to a certain time signature or rhythm to then create a basic drum beat.The bass is the deeper note on a drum beat. It is often played on regular drums by hitting a pedal on the ground that then hits the middle of a kick drum.
The snare is the complementary note to the bass. It is often played on regular drums by hitting the rim of the drum and the middle of the drum with the drumstick.
The hi-hat is also known as the lightest note in a drum beat. In a regular drum kit, the hi-hat is made of two cymbals mounted on a stand.

, To create a basic beat on the bucket drum, you will first need to identify the three elements of a drum beat that you can make on the bucket.Begin by placing the bucket one to two feet in front of the stool on a hard, concrete floor. Sit down on the stool with a drumstick in each hand. The plastic bucket should be between your legs and you should be able to hit the bucket easily with the drumsticks.
Use the middle of the bucket as the bass note. Place one foot on the bottom edge of the bucket and tilt it slightly toward you. Then, use one of the drumsticks to hit the middle of the bucket. This should produce a deep bass note. You can also simply hit the middle of the bucket to make a bass note, but tilting the bucket will create a deeper sound.
Use the rim of the drum as the snare note. Hit the rim of the drum and the middle of the drum at the same time to make a snare note.
Use the concrete floor as the hi-hat. To make a hi-hat note, you can lean down and hit the concrete floor. This should create a nice, sharp hi-hat note.

, Once you have identified the three elements of a drum beat on the bucket (and on the floor), you can put them together to make a basic drum beat.Start by hitting your sticks together four times as this will help you to remember the 4-beat count. Then, tilt the bucket slightly and hit the middle of the bucket with one drum stick to make a bass note. Then, release the bucket and hit the rim and middle of the bucket to make a snare note. Play the bass note and then the snare note four time each, creating a 4-beat rhythm.
After you have played the bass and the snare four times through, add in the hi-hat. Lean down and hit the floor with the other drum stick in a quick 1-2-1-2 rhythm. Continue to play the bass and the snare with the other drum stick to a 4-beat count.

, After enough practice, you should be able to play the bass, the snare, and the hi-hat at a 4-beat count at a regular tempo. You can try to speed up your playing so you are drumming faster to the 4-beat count and the beat sounds more rapid.


Speeding up the tempo will be good practice for doing more complex beats on the bucket drum, as it will get you more accustomed to playing to a different rhythms and speeds.

, A two handed drum beat is not too difficult to learn on its own. But it will allow you to learn more complex drum beats and also improvise your own drum beats.This two handed drum beat involves hitting the bass once with one stick, hitting the snare with one stick, hitting the bass twice with one stick, and then hitting the snare with one stick. You will always hit the bass note with your right hand and the snare note with your left hand.
Practice this beat on the bucket drum. It can help to say out loud “boom” as you hit the bass, or middle of the bucket, and “ghat” as you hit the snare, or the rim of the bucket. The two handed drum beat should follow the pattern: “boom, ghat, boom, boom, ghat”. Make sure your right hand is making the “boom” and your left hand is making the “ghat”.

, Once you get the hang of the two handed drum beat, add extra beats to create some variation in your drumming. You can string these extra beats together to create a longer drumming routine.Practice this by saying “boom” and “ghat” out loud as you hit the bucket with the drum sticks. Run through the first “boom, ghat, boom, boom, ghat” and repeat it a second time. On the second run though, add an extra “boom” or bass note hit, so the pattern becomes “boom,ghat, boom, boom, ghat, boom”.
Then, add in three hits with your right drumstick and then three hits with your left drumstick. This should create a “boom, boom, boom” and then “ghat, ghat, ghat” rhythm. Finish with one hit of the right drumstick and one hit of the left drumstick. This will create a 123-123-1-2 pattern, where you do three quick bass hits, three quick snare hits, one bass hit and one snare hit.

, A stick flip is a stickhandling trick that you can try to add some complexity to your bucket drumming. Start by practicing flipping one stick in your hand, throwing it and flipping it once in the air. Do this several times so you get a feel for how the stick should flip in your hand.You can then integrate the stick flip into your drumming routine to make your drumming more impressive. Do this by flipping one stick in one hand while you are playing the drum beat with the drumstick in your other hand.
Play a basic beat first with both sticks, such as hitting the drum once with one stick and then hitting the drum once with the other stick. Then, as you hit the drum again with one stick, flip the stick in your other hand.
Speed this up so that eventually you are playing a drum beat at a 4-count and flipping one stick in your hand. You can then add the stick flip to any of the drum beats you are playing on the bucket drum to make your routine more interesting.

Consider the price.",How to Buy a Fiddle," Where is the violin of your interest made and by whom? What is the reputation of that particular violin maker and for how long has he been in the violin business? Are there any buyer reviews available online? There are several forums, blogs, and review websites available on the Internet that should make your research very easy and bring out the truth about the violin maker you are interested in.


If you choose to buy a violin online, extend your research and try to find out what the reputation of the online violin store is. Try to contact the store via phone, email or filling in a form that is available online and see what kind of response you get; try to see how fast, how friendly, how accurate, how knowledgeable, how useful the response you got was. All these elements of the online communication should give you clues about how your overall violin buying experience is going to be.





;
, The wood used in violin making is of vital importance for the sound of the instrument. Many say that European wood is the best when it comes to instruments that need high quality resonance wood. Violins are traditionally made of flamed maple and resonance spruce. This is the traditional combination that most violin makers use. The top of the violin is made of resonance spruce. The back, the sides, and the neck of the violin are made of famed maple. The accessories (chin rest, tailpiece, pegs, and fingerboard) are made of ebony. The wood must be naturally dried up, in the open, to naturally achieve the perfect internal balance that will prevent the violin from cracking in the future. Wood is a material that changes its dimensions based on fluctuations in external temperature and humidity conditions.

, String instruments in general, and violins in particular, can be finished with either nitro or oil varnish. One recommendation is to choose the violins finished with oil varnish. While the nitro varnish is sprayed on the violins, the oil varnish is applied manually, with a brush. The varnish is applied in several coats, regardless of the nature of the varnish. Before applying the next coat, the previous one has to dry completely.


The difference between the oil varnish and the nitro varnish is that the nitro varnish dries up very quickly, and the next coat is applied within 10-20 minutes. The oil varnish takes longer to dry out, up to 24 hours, and after each coat, the varnished is leveled with a very fine sandpaper, operation which ensures a homogeneous distribution of the varnish and a perfect adherence of the varnish to the body of the violin.






No air particles are allowed in the varnish applied on top of the violins, and the sanding phase ensures this. A violin can have 8-10 coats of oil varnish applied to it, but they all are extremely thin and light. The oil varnish has overall superior qualities. It has a better resistance and behavior in time. The oil varnish is very elastic and can take the dimensional changes of the wood very well.






The nitro varnish, due to its limited elasticity, will crack if exposed to sudden changes in temperature and humidity. For example, if a violin finished with nitro varnish is stored in a room where the temperature is very high, the wood will dry out, which means it will lose water, and its dimensions will reduce. If a violin finished with oil varnish is stored in the same room, under the same temperature and humidity conditions, you will not notice anything. The oil varnish will follow the same pattern and will adjust its size accordingly. Unlike the oil varnish, the nitro varnish, due to its lack of elasticity, cannot lower or increase its dimensions, and it will simply crack.







, In order to establish the correct violin size that you need, you need to extend your right arm and measure the length from your neck to the middle of your palm.


Here is a chart that will help you determine the correct size, based on your measurement:

Arm length: 23″ or more - Recommended Violin Size: 4/4 (full size)
Arm length: 22″ - Recommended Violin Size: 3/4
Arm length: 20″ - Recommended Violin Size: 1/2
Arm length: 18″ - Recommended Violin Size: 1/4
Arm length: 16″ - Recommended Violin Size: 1/8
Arm length: 15″ - Recommended Violin Size: 1/10
Arm length: 14″ - Recommended Violin Size: 1/16



, The price is not always a reflection of quality in the violins’ world. Factors that contribute to price include the wood, workmanship, and set-up. There is a very wide range of prices to fit every budget, from a few hundred to several thousand dollars.

Learn some alternate tunings to open up your repertoire.",How to Tune a Mandolin," A mandolin is traditionally tuned G-D-A-E, from low to high, with each pair of strings tuned to the same tone. In other words, the instrument is tuned G-G-D-D-A-A-E-E, taking into consideration each individual string. When you're holding the mandolin correctly, the highest string pair (E) should be the closest to the floor.


If you play guitar, it can also be helpful to think of it as the lowest four guitar strings (E-A-D-G), but in reverse. That can also help you get familiar with the fingerings when you're first getting started on the instrument.;
, On most mandolins, the tuners for both G strings and both D strings will be on the side of the headstock closest to you, while the tuners for both A strings and E strings will be on the side of the headstock closest to the floor, in order.


As you tune, you generally want to tune in that clockwise pattern on the tuners, around the headstock, working your way down the instrument and higher in pitch.

, What makes tuning a mandolin more difficult than tuning a violin, of course, is that there are 8 strings instead of 4, meaning that you have to be precise or the instrument will be out of tune. It can be difficult to know which string is out of tune when you're striking them both in unison.


Use ""rest strokes"" (in which you dampen each string with the pick after playing) to isolate each note individually as you're tuning. This will get a clearer tone on the electronic tuner, or whatever other tuning method you're using., As with any stringed instrument, you generally want to tune from flat to sharp, tuning the string up in pitch, rather than down from a higher note to the correct tone. This is because you want to settle the tension in the string toward the gear, not away from it. When you tune down, you risk letting the tension slip on the tuning gear as you play, making the string will go flat. This is especially true with new strings.

, Worn out or rusty strings will go out of the tune more easily and bedevil your fingers as you're learning. Make sure you change your strings out regularly to keep your instrument in tune. You don't need to change them every night unless you're Tim O'Brien, but consider changing them every 4-6 weeks of moderate to heavy usage.

, It can be frustrating to tune immediately after putting new strings on the mandolin, because it'll slip out after only a few minutes. After putting new strings on, each string puts lots of pounds per square inch of tension on the neck, and the wood will flex slightly. You need to account for this by getting the strings close and then letting the instrument rest for a second before fine-tuning. You'll get it in tune more quickly and more accurately this way.

, The most accurate and efficient way of tuning your mandolin is to buy an electronic tuner made for the purpose. A violin tuner or an electronic tuner made for the mandolin are both appropriate for your purposes.


Chromatic tuners that clip onto the headstock of various acoustic instruments are recommended if you're going to be regularly tuning during practice sessions and gigs. You can leave it clipped onto your instrument, ready to fine-tune at a moment's notice. They can range anywhere from $10 to upward of $30.
Online tuners are also available that play a tone for you to replicate, but these are somewhat less accurate methods than doing it with a tuner that picks up sound. If you're on a budget, consider downloading a free smartphone tuning app, which tend to be of fairly high quality and are either cheap or free.

, If the tuner features settings for different instruments, set it to mandolin or violin, and find a quiet room to tune in that will be free of background noise that will affect the tuner's efficacy.

, Tighten the corresponding tuner until you get the string relatively close. It doesn't have to be exact yet, because you're going to go back through after you've done a pass. Continue tuning each of the strings, tightening the tuning peg up and getting the tension close, watching the tuner closely.


Go back through and do another pass, fine-tuning each string as closely as possible. Watch the tuner for cues. Most give you an indication of whether or not you're sharp or flat, and most turn green or blink when you're right on the money.

, Now go back through the strings again and play each double set to make sure it sounds right. Pluck both G strings and listen. It can be tempting to get too attached to your tuner, but you've got to use your ears too. They're not perfect, and each instrument has its own quirks and habits. Listen closely to the doubled strings to see if it needs further adjustment.

, While it's important to get each note in tune in terms of pitch, it's also not necessary unless you want to play with other people. You also need to tune the instrument to itself, to make sure you can play and practice in a way that sounds good. You may not always have a tuner handy, so it's an important skill to learn.


Practice checking your harmonics and intervals by playing notes at the 12th fret to make sure it's in key in the higher octaves. Check and double check.

, Adjust both E strings until they're in tune with each other, then fret the A string at the 7th fret and make that string sound the same as the 1st string played “open” or non-fretted. Keep moving down the neck, doing the same thing with the other strings.

, Use an in-tune piano, guitar, or banjo to tune to. Have your playing partner play each note individually (GDAE--you've got to memorize those!) and take your time getting it in tune. This is an important skill to develop in your ear training, helping you to recognize microtones and sharp and flat sounds. You'll be a better player if you can recognize when you're in and out of tune with your ear.

, The only difference between a violin and a fiddle is the way that it's tuned, in most cases. Most mandolin players learn to play the instrument by tuning it to GDAE, but that doesn't mean you need to always play it. Some American folk musicians even call it ""Eye-talian"" tuning to suggest that it's fancy and formal. Learn some alternate tunings and start messing around with new methods of fingering the same old chords. It can open up whole worlds. Try out:

Get your band in the studio - write songs, then get in the studio and record, listen back.,
Develop a good sense of rhythm - learn to groove.,
Don't let the lead guitarist think it's ok to drown you out - seriously, anyone who thinks that bass is not needed or only plays one note for the whole song is a butthead.",How to Be a Cool Bass Player," Before you get the ""cool"" part down, you gotta get the ""bass player"" bit down, makes sense? figure out your influences. Get a bass (obviously). Get lessons, talk to other bassists, practice, practice, practice. Learn bass songs that you like and try to figure them out by ear.;
, Trust me, you'll be terrible at first whether you like it or not but if you truly love playing music you'll stick at it and get good.

, Do some gigs and try out different stage moves. Here are some examples; headbanging, putting your foot on the monitor, jumping around, licking your singer's face, playing behind your head, spinning, hardcore dancing, hitting an open chord with delay and swinging the bass around your head, or simply smashing the bass, though this may be difficult provided it's not a hollow body. Pretty much, just do whatever you feel right at the time. Look cool as well - never copy bass players/other musicians who you think look cool on stage, because losing your originality is never cool.

,,, Personally, I recommend the Flea approach, nude.

, Change what you think could be better, then record it again ! This is a crucial stage in building musicianship. Rhythmically copy what your drummer is playing - and vice versa. The bass and drums have to link in together rhythmically. ""sweet child of mine"" by Guns n Roses is a good example of this. As are many Rush and Tool songs. The bass and drums link perfectly in most tool songs, creating the driving rhythm that makes tool so intense. Another good example of bass and drums meshing is Jaco Pastorius and weather report, though the drums are jazzy and often arrhythmic, a closer listening reveals the amount of thought having gone into the planning of that music. Listen to ""the greeting song"" by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, the drums and the bass fit perfectly, with the bass drum doing exactly what Flea is playing.

, Work with the drummer. Listen to bassists like flea, Jaco Pastorious, Les Clay pool, Steve Harris of Iron Maiden, Cliff Burton of Metallica... The list goes on and on. If the drums and bass are locked together, the singer and guitarists can make a few mistakes and still have the song sound great. Listen to ""Slow Ride"" by Fog . Listen to that kickin' slap bass during the verses. Also, learn funk baselines. Jaco Pastorious, Bootsy Collins, etc. In my experience, these are some of the hardest yet most rhythmically groovin' basslines. Try to incorporate their grooviness into your own songs. Head bobbin bass? Sexy.

, Then again, don't drown him/her out either. Work with him/her. Sometime it is good to play the same part he's playing. A good argument to convince an egotistical guitarist is to have him/her listen to iron maiden's ""the trooper"" or ""running free"" without bass. Yuck. Or ask ""where would the (insert band with awesome bassist here) be without (said bassist). Like, Red Hot Chili Peppers without Flea. If all else fails, leave the band.

Decide what kind of shaker you want to make.,
Gather your materials.,
Open your plastic Easter egg so the two pieces are completely separated.,
Fill the bottom half of the egg almost up the rim.

,
Glue the two pieces together.,
Wipe away the excess glue.",How to Make an Egg Shaker," You may want a soft, smooth sound, or a loud and rattling shake. This all depends on what you are going to use your shaker for.;
, Your shaker's sound will depend mainly on what materials you choose to put inside it. Some good, basic materials to use include:


Polenta. This will deliver a very soft, light sound and may not be loud enough for live performances.
Rice. Slightly louder than polenta, the sound of a rice shaker will be sharper and more of a rattle.
Lentil. A shaker filled with lentils will sound rough and loud.
Bean. For a harsh, loud rattling sound similar to that of maracas, use beans in your shaker.

, (If there is a hinge on your egg, cutting it might make things easier. Try to use an egg without a hinge.)

,, Using a quick-setting clear glue, trace a thin line of glue around the rim of the bottom half. Firmly attach the top half, then let it dry.

, When you attach your two halves, some glue may remain along the crack of the egg. Wipe it off with the small end of a twisted or folder paper towel.

Find what you'll need to tune the harp.,
Set the tuner.,
Strum a note, and watch the tuner screen.,
Place the tuning key on the peg attached to the string.,
Continue this process with all the rest of the strings.,
Play your tuned harp!",How to Tune a Lap Harp," Most lap harp kits include a tuning key (small ""L""-shaped silver instrument with a hole to fit over the tuning pegs on the side(s) of the instrument and a handle to turn it), a pick (which will make strumming and note quality easier and better), and most have music that you can insert below the strings, which marks the names of the notes on all the strings. Some kits may even have a separate sheet with all the notes marked and tuning instructions. Be sure to have something of this sort so that you'll know what notes each string is supposed to play. In addition to all of this, you will need a tuner, preferably a small electronic one.;
, You'll be tuning to a frequency of 440 Hz (hertz), sometimes displayed on the tuner as A = 440. Keep in mind that the lap harp is not a transposing instrument, so the note you see on the screen when you play a note will be in concert pitch.

, Is the note displayed even the note that this string is supposed to be playing? If it isn't, note how many half or whole steps it is away from the intended note. Also note which way the needle is pointing - if you're already on the correct note, is it flat or sharp?

, To correct a note that has gone a little bit flat, ever so slightly tighten the string. Do the opposite to correct a sharp pitch. If you're on a completely different note, tighten the string to make the note higher, or loosen it to make it lower. Be very careful not to over tighten the strings!

, This may be slow and tedious work, so take plenty of breaks. If you come across a particularly difficult string, you may wish to ask someone else for help, or get back to it later. Check your progress periodically by playing up and down through the strings you've tuned... you'll start to notice the instrument sounding a lot better.

, It sounds a lot better now, doesn't it? It's only a matter of time before it'll need to be re-tuned, so enjoy it while it lasts!

Gather your materials.,
Drill holes in the pie pan for hanging.,
Loop the string through the gong.,
Construct a mallet for striking the gong.,
Suspend the gong from a stand if desired.",How to Make a Chinese Gong," To build your homemade gong, you will need a disposable cake or pie pan, an electric drill, and some string or twine for hanging it. You can use nearly anything for a mallet, but it will need to have a long handle and a relatively soft head.;
, The gong will need holes to be suspended with the string. Begin by fitting your electric drill with a bit just wider in diameter than your string. Drill 2 holes near the top of the pan, about 6 inches (15 cm) apart.

, Begin by passing the string through the first hole from back to front, and then pass the string through the second hole from front to back. Tie the loose end of the string to the other side of the string to create a loop of string about the same diameter as the pie pan. Cut off any excess string with scissors.

, You can improvise a gong mallet from materials you already have in your home. For example, a small mallet can be made by poking the tip of a pencil through a wine cork. Hold the pencil in your hand and strike the center of the gong with the cork end. An alternative is to take a long object such as a pencil or wooden spoon and wrap electric tape thickly around one end to form a bulb shape. Use the taped end for striking the gong.

, The gong can be played by holding it from the stringed loop and striking it with your free hand. If you want to mount your Chinese gong from a stand, however, you can build one from materials you have around your home. The string loop should be hung from a horizontal brace supported by 2 vertical pillars on each side. These supports can be made from cardboard, PVC pipe, or any other sturdy household material you have.

Poke toothpicks through the tube.,
Fill the tube with coiled aluminum foil.,
Cap one end of the tube.,
Pour the filler into the the tube.,
Test the rainstick and add more filler if needed.,
Cap the other end of the tube.",How to Make a Rain Stick," A sturdy, cardboard tube will form the structure of your rain stick. You will want to avoid flimsy tubes—the cardboard must be durable enough to withstand several punctures from nails or toothpicks. You may use a recycled cardboard tube or purchase a new cardboard tube for this project.


You may use a recycled paper towel roll, chip canister, or gift wrap tube.You may buy a cardboard shipping tube from the post office, an office supply store, or a shipping center.;
, While some tubes, such as shipping or chip canisters, may come with end caps, other cardboard rolls will not. To make your own end caps, you will need construction paper, a pencil, and a pair of scissors.


Place one end of the tube flat on a piece of construction paper.
With a pencil, trace the end of the tube onto the paper.
Draw a second circle around the first circle. The two circles should be approximately ½ inch apart.
Draw 6 to 12 spokes between the two circles. You will use the spokes to attach the cap to the cardboard tube.
Cut along the edge of the second circle.
Cut along each spoke line.
Repeat., The soothing sounds of a rain stick are created by a filler, such as rice, falling through a maze of static objects, like nails. You can fill your rain stick with one or more materials.Common fillers include:


Rice
Dried beans
Corn Kernels
Small pastas
Beads, Nails are ideal for thicker cardboard tubes, like shipping or chip canisters. Select nails that are shorter than the tube’s diameter. With an adult’s help, hammer the nails through the side of the tube at random intervals—you can hold the nails while an adult taps them into place or visa versa. To secure the nails in place, wrap the tube in a layer of duct tape.


You may insert as many nails as you would like.
For decoration, use a patterned or colored duct tape.
Using different sized nails will create an interesting sound!, Toothpicks are a great option for narrower cardboard tubes, like a paper towel roll—the tube’s diameter should be less than the length of a toothpick. You will need an adult’s help to complete this step.


If you want to decorate the tube, do so before you insert the toothpicks.
Use a sewing needle or push pin to poke holes at random intervals into the side of the tube. You will need to create between 80 and 100 holes.
Insert a toothpick through one hole and out another. The tips of the toothpick should remain on the outside of the tube. Repeat 39 to 49 times, altering the angle of each toothpick.
Coat both ends of each toothpick with a dab of glue.
Once the glue is dry, cut off the pointed ends with a pair of cutting pliers., Aluminum foil is the ideal material for young children to use. You will need two pieces of aluminum foil. Each piece should be 6 inches wide and approximately ¾ the length of the tube. Roll each piece into a long, snake-like strip and then coil it into a spring.


After you cap one end of the tube, you will insert the aluminum foil springs., If you made your own end caps, set one end of the tube in the center of the paper cap. Fold each of the spokes up towards the tube and adhere it with glue. Allow the glue to dry.If your tube came with caps, insert one into the tube.
You may reinforce the cap with duct tape or rubber bands., Carefully pour the filler into the tube. If the tube’s opening is narrow, you may want to use a funnel.


If you chose to use aluminum foil, insert it into the tube before you pour in the filler.

, Cover the open end with your hand or put in the remaining cap. Tip the rain stick over and listen. If you are happy with the sound, proceed to the next step. If you aren’t quite satisfied, adjust the amount of filler you have in the tube by:


Adding more filler
Removing some of the filler
Trying a different material, Place the cap on top of the tube’s opening. Fold down each spoke onto the outside of the tube and glue. Once the glue is dry, enjoy your new instrument!When the glue is dry, it will no longer feel tacky to the touch. See the packaging for specific curing instructions.
You may reinforce both caps with duct tape or rubber bands."

Between rewinds remember to ""Big Up"" as many people as can be thought of.

",How to Be a Drum & Bass Junglist," 6.Listen closely and you will notice that bars are grouped in phrases that are usually 8, 16 or 32 bars. The notes that you make will help you learn the records. Your goal at first is to match phrases at the end of a particular record to the phrases at the beginning of another record.;
, Let the record 1 play through the speakers.Then cue up the record 2 in the earphones and search for the first good beat of the record. Wait for the one beat at the beginning of a new phrase on the record 1 and drop the one beat at the beginning of a phrase on the record 2 at the same time.Then you will be using pitch control on the same record to speed up and slow down record 2 until it is at the same bpm as the record 1. If necessary, pick up the needle on the record 2 and start over until the beats match.

, Not all these wacky phrase jumblings will work all the time. Use the notes you took while listening to the records and fit the song phrases together like a puzzle.

, Push any two keys on a keyboard, there is a certain feeling that the two notes give which is based on the interval of the notes to one another. You can use this to build or release tension in your set if you know what you are doing. You can mess around with your records and practice without knowing what you are doing, but it helps to look at the art like real musicians and learn theory.

, This is why sometimes you match 2 records together and the melodies and basslines match great, but when you try to do it later, when the pitches are different from where they were the first time you mixed the records, they will not sound matched.

, Learn to have fun and not care about learning more, otherwise you will be like most of the DJ that quit when they can't beatmatch like the professionals. Remember that people like the music, and if you are playing the jams, nobody will remember the one or two mess ups of the night.

, If the crowd is yelling ""rewind, rewind,"" stop the record and play the jam you found once more. Also, remember that shouting ""deal with the matter"" at gurning little speedfreaks like blitzkrieg is like the staple diet of MC phrases.

Begin by placing your left hand on the left side of the piano's keys.,
Move your pinky finger to G#.,
Play an F# and C#.,
Finally, play D and A.,
Practice this left hand sequence.,
Switch to your right hand.,
Shift your thumb to G#.,
Shift your thumb to F#.,
Finally, move your thumb up to A again.,
Practice again!,
Put your hard work to use!","How to Play ""Someone Like You"" (Intro) on the Piano1"," In the intro to ""Someone Like You,"" your left hand is responsible for playing the low (or ""bass"") notes. The first notes you'll hit are the notes A and E. Press these keys down with your pinky finger and thumb at the same time. Your pinky should be on the second A below middle C, and your thumb on the E above that A.









Hold this note for 4 beats. In other words, hold the keys down, then slowly and evenly count, ""One, two, three, four."" then release them.
If you don't know the names of the notes on the piano, don't worry. Simply put your pinky on the white key between the two rightmost black keys in the second cluster of three black keys (starting from the left side of the piano). This is A. Put your thumb four white keys above A. This is E. Note - these positions assume a standard-size piano.;
, After the 4 beat count of A-E, keep your thumb in its place on E and move your pinky finger on to G#. This is the black key just to the left of the white A key. Hold both of these keys for 4 beats.








, For the next notes, you must move your whole left hand. Place your pinky finger on F# and your pointer finger (or thumb, which ever one is more comfortable) on C#. F# is one black key lower than G#, while C# is the leftmost of the two black keys below the E you were just playing. Hold both of these keys down on for 4 beats also.








, For these notes, you'll have to move your hand again. Move your pinky finger three white keys to the left, placing it on D. Place your thumb on the A above it, which should be exactly the same note as very first A you played (only, this time, we're playing it as the higher of our two notes, rather than the lower.). Again, hold these notes down for 4 beats.








, Repeat steps 1-4 continuously until you can play these two-note chords without making mistakes.








, After repeating steps 1-4, now take your left hand off the keyboard and put your right hand on. Place your right thumb on the A key closest to middle C, then put your pointer finger on C# and pinky on E. Play A,C#,E,C#. Repeat this sequence, playing it four times per measure (one 4-note repetition per beat).









In this song, your right hand has to work a lot faster than your left hand. Listen to a recording of the song to get a sense of how fast you should be going - it's OK to practice this part slower than it's played in the song, slowly working it up to speed.
Note that, if you count both white and black keys, each note repeats every 12 keys up or down the keyboard. If you're having trouble finding notes with your right hand, simply count up from your left hand's bass notes to orient yourself.

, Keeping the rest of your right hand in place (pointer or middle finger on C#, pinky on E), move your thumb to G# (the black key below A). Play this sequence of notes as above: G#,C#,E,C#. Repeat this exactly as above.








, This sequence of notes is slightly different - you'll have to stretch your fingers farther than before. With your thumb on the F# below the G# you were just playing, place your middle finger on the C# above it, then your pinky on the F# above that! In other words, you're playing two different F#'s this time. Play the sequence: F# (low), C#, F# (high), C#. This may be a bit of a stretch for your right hand! Repeat this sequence with the same rhythm as above.








, Your thumb will play A again, but your other fingers will play different notes this time: move your middle finger to the D above A and your ring finger to the F# above D. Play A, D, F#, D. Repeat this as above.








, Repeat steps 6-9 over and over again until you can play it without messing up. Listen to a recording of the song and try to match your speed and style to Wilson's piano line. It may take a while to get this step completely right, but be persistent - the results are worth it!









One sure-fire way to get your playing up to speed is to practice with a metronome, which are available for cheap at almost every music store. Metronomes can count the beat for you, making it easier to keep your playing in time. You can even set your metronome to a slow tempo and slowly increase it to gradually increase your playing speed.

, Put both your right and left hands on the keyboard and play together. Play each part at the same speed - though your right hand is playing more notes than your left hand, both hands should change position at the same time every four beats. With luck, you'll sound just like the recording! If you're an absolute beginner, the intro to this song will probably take more than just one day to perfect. Keep at it! Set aside time each day to practice, and within about 5 days, you should see serious improvement!

Spice up your performance.","How to Play ""Someone Like You"" (Intro) on the Piano2"," The intro to ""Someone Like You"" only uses four chords: A, A/G#, F#m, and D. These four chords simply repeat over and over in a 4-bar line, with each chord receiving four beats. Basically, each of these chords is played as a whole note at a tempo of about 68-70 BPM. Practice this simple chord sequence until you have it memorized. It shouldn't take too long.









Since the intro part to this song is played the same as the verse, you can even sing over it! ""I heard that you're settled down...""
A/G# may look intimidating, but it's not - it's simply an A major chord, except that the root note is a G# instead of an A. Just move the lowest note in the chord down one half-step and you're playing an A/G#!

, In the intro, Dan Wilson doesn't ever play the entire chord at once. Rather, he plays single notes with his left hand and plays arpeggios with his right hand. To learn the intro, first practice simply playing the root notes of the chords with your left hand. At a tempo of 68-70 BPM, play each note for four beats (in other words, play it as a whole note.).









As a reminder, the root notes of the chords are: A, G#, F#, and D. Start two A's below Middle C.
When you're confident with this bass line, you don't simply have to play each note as a whole note. Make subtle changes in the rhythm to spice up your playing. For example, try holding each root note for three beats, then hitting the note again on beat ""four"" of each measure.

, With your right hand, practice ""arpeggiating"" each of the chords in the chord sequence you memorized in step 1 of this section. Arpeggiating something simply means playing the tones in the chord as separate notes, not all together at once. For the A and A/G# chords, you'll play the root, third, fifth, then third of each chord - fairly simple. However, for the F#m chord, you'll play the root, fifth, octave, and fifth, and for the D chord, you'll play the fifth, root, third, and root - in other words, you'll play like the first too chords, but with the notes in a different order. Play this sequence 4 times per measure (in other words, each note should be a sixteenth note at about 68-70 BPM). See below for the notes you should play for the chords (repeat each four times):










A: A C# E C#.

A/G#: G# C# E C#

F#m: F# (low) C# F# (high) C#

D: A D F# D (note: the A in this arpeggio is the exact same note as the root note in the A chord.)

, Now, you've learned the parts for both of your hands. Next, practice playing both of these parts simultaneously. Unless you're already an experienced player, it may be difficult for you to play the parts together at full speed at first - this is O.K. Don't be afraid to begin at half-time and slowly increase the tempo until you can play the intro comfortably at about 68-70 BPM.








, One of the things that makes the intro to ""Someone Like You"" so beautiful is that Wilson plays it with dynamics. This means that he doesn't play every note exactly the same, like a robot. Instead, some notes are played louder than others and some notes are played quieter than others. In the intro to this song, the dynamics are pretty subtle, but if you listen to the record, you can still hear them. Listen for how Wilson lingers on certain notes and plays certain note a little louder than others. These small, barely-noticeable changes take the music from ordinary to beautiful.









For instance, listen to how Wilson plays the high notes in each arpeggio (in other words, the fifths.). He plays these notes slightly louder than the rest of the notes in the arpeggio. This accents the notes, basically making them ring out clearer and sound more ""important"" in the arpeggio.

Mallets can be found packaged with the instrument or at music stores. Many mallet heads are made of plastic, while others are made of nylon, rubber, or metal. Plastic mallets are the perfect choice for beginning players.Plastic and nylon mallets are a useful tool for all players. Metal mallets produce a better quality sound but require more of a deft touch.;
, Many kids play a glockenspiel while sitting. The keys are set in a frame which makes the instrument ideal for the ground or another flat surface. Glockenspiels may also be placed on larger stands so you can play while standing. Find these at music supply stores., Before you play, make sure you feel comfortable. Bending over the keys is painful and sets a bad habit for beginners. Keep your back straight as you reach your hands out towards the keys. Adjust the glockenspiel until you can reach all of them without bending over or reaching up.

, Sometimes a tough day or nervousness can spill over into playing. Before you begin, take the time to shake out your arms. Practice turning your wrists and shrugging your shoulders until you feel loose. When you pick up the mallets, your grip should not feel tight.Tenseness will wear out your arms. You’ll also strike the keys too hard.

, Holding a mallet is like holding a drumstick or bike handle. Use your thumb to support the outside of the mallet. Wrap your index finger around the other side. This finger should not be on top of the mallet. Move your other fingers under your index finger. Your grip should be about halfway up the mallet shaft.One way to check your grip is to open up your hand. Try to balance the mallet on your index finger. The spot where the mallet feels balanced is where your grip should be.

, Stay relaxed as you move the mallets towards the glockenspiel. Hold the mallets about three inches (7.62 cm) above the keys at all times. Adjust your hands so that the mallets are level with the ground., Try striking one of the keys. When you hit the middle part of the bar, you’ll get the best sound. Listen as the note vibrates cleanly. Striking near the ends of the bars produces a more muted sound., The key to good sound is a gentle strike. Don’t use force. Instead, bring the mallet down gently and allow the impact with the bar to bounce it back into position. Striking too hard will also cause the bar to vibrate too much and produce a muted sound., Don’t draw back when the mallet rebounds off the bar. Return it to a holding position right above the keys. As long as you keep the mallets about three inches above the keys, you’ll be able to play notes in rapid succession., Strike the second note with your other hand. If you hit the first one with your left, hit the next one with your right. If you hit it with your right, switch to your left. You will need to cross over your arms as you play. This is needed for playing two nearby notes very quickly., Learning the sound each key makes is enough to start you playing. Hit the keys one by one, familiarizing yourself with the tones. Larger keys are on the left side of the glockenspiel. These produce deeper, lower-pitched sounds. Smaller keys produce higher, lighter sounds., Larger glockenspiels feature a second set of keys. This set is above the regular keys and has less bars. These are sharp and flat notes. Strike these one at a time so you can learn what sound they make. They will make a sound that’s between whatever two bars on the lower set of keys they are positioned over.

Try striking the lower bars they’re near. Start with the left bar in the bottom row, then strike the small key in the top row, and finish with the right bar in the bottom row. You’ll hear how the tone gradually increases as move right on the glockenspiel.

, Learning the notes the keys represents will teach you how to read music. You can write the notes on small stickers and place them on the keys. On an eight-key glockenspiel, the largest key on the left is a C key (middle C, or C4 on the piano). Larger glockenspiels often start at a low A note and end on a high A note.The notations such as C or C4 represent notes on the musical staff. The notes are named by letter. They go A-B-C-D-E-F-G and then start again at A.
The sharp notes are represented like C#. Flat notes are represented like D♭. C# and D♭ sound the same and would be found on the small key between the C and D keys.
Investing in a book on how to read music is very useful for learning. These books typically have a few simple songs you can sound out while memorizing what notes to strike.

, Scales are when you play up or down the glockenspiel keys. Start at one end and play all the way up to the other. Then reverse direction and go back to the beginning. Alternate the hand you use to strike each note. This is a great way to get used to crossing your arms and increase your playing speed.You can also try playing the individual notes of chords. The C Major chord arpeggio is C, E, G, C, E, G, C. Play the notes in order to practice your playing motion while learning the sounds of the notes.

, Set the mallets down and cross the shaft of the one closest to you over the other one. Use your pinky, ring, and middle fingers to pick up the mallets. Place your thumb and index finger between the mallets. These two fingers adjust how close together the mallet are. You’ll be able to play two notes with one hand. You can use your other hand regularly or hold two mallets with it to play four notes at once.This grip is called the traditional cross grip and is commonly used outside of America.
Many American players are taught the Burton grip. The mallet shaft farthest from you crosses over the other one. Your index finger goes between the shafts. Your thumb stays on the outside.
A third grip is the Stevens grip. The mallet shafts do not cross. Place one mallet between your middle and ring fingers. Use your pinky and ring fingers to hold it. For the other mallet, set the bottom of the shaft in the middle of your palm, resting it against your index finger, then pinch it between your index finger and thumb.

, You will need to use three or four mallets for this. A chord is produced when you sound three or more notes at once. Use your thumb and index finger to manipulate the mallets so you can reach the keys you want. Play the keys as you normally would by bouncing the mallets and returning them to position three inches above the glockenspiel.

One chord you can try is the C major chord. Find a C key. Find the E and G keys next to it. Use one hand to reach either the C and E or E and G keys. Reach the other key with your remaining hand.

, Then cut strips of newspaper about 6 inches (15.2 cm) long by ½ inch wide. (save time by cutting triple layers.)

, Dip the newspaper strips in this mixture and apply the wet strips to the balloon, criss crossing them. Use about five layers, to make the maraca strong. Make sure that no part of the balloon shows through except at the very bottom.

, Let both balloons dry overnight.

, When the balloon has gotten small enough, pull it out by the tied end.

,, A tube from gift-wrapping paper is best, but you can use a paper towel tube instead.

, Make each slit about 3 inches (7.6 cm) long. Circle the tubes with tape just below the slits to keep them from splitting farther.

, Fit the maracas onto the slit pieces and tape the slit pieces firmly to the maracas.

,, Cut 1 1/2 –inch slits all along the edge of each strip, about ¼ inch apart. This will make a fringe.

, Wind and glue the strip around the handle toward the bottom end. Repeat with the other handle.

Get a bottle of liquid Brasso (not the impregnated wadding), which should cost around $3-$5.,
Once you have acquired the materials, you will want to take your cymbals and strip them of any hardware, such as straps if they are marching band cymbals, or the clutch off of a top Hi-hat, or sizzles if it is a Sizzle cymbal, so that they don't get in the way of the cleaning process.

,
Now that you have prepped your cymbals for cleaning, apply some Brasso in the shape of a ring starting at the bell of the cymbal, or near the edge of the cymbal if you would prefer to start there.,
Once you are done cleaning the cymbals, use a fresh rag to dry the cymbals, and wipe off any excess residue remaining.,
Repeat if necessary.,
Repeat these steps on the underside of the cymbals.

",How to Clean Cymbals With Brasso," You can find them at your local hardware store. Get a few clean, fresh rags. You might need more depending on how dirty your cymbal is, as the rags will be pick up varying amounts of sludge from the cymbals, and the grooves. You should keep one or two rags for drying the cymbal(s), or you can simply use any dry spots on your wiping rag to do the trick.;
,, Buff with the rag in circular motions. You can continue to apply to the bow of the cymbal, and work your way to the edge, or work your way into the bell, depending on what area you started on. You will start to see a black/brown/green/dark blue sludge on the cymbals, and your rag, which means you are thoroughly cleaning the dirt out of the grooves, and the cymbal itself. Replace your rag if necessary.

, You will start to notice that your cymbals are starting to shine, and by the time you are done, there will be a noticeable difference.

, Although the first coat will clean it, and make it shine, a second might be needed to achieve the full cleanliness.

","How to Play ""Jingle Bells"" on the Piano"," For Jingle Bells, you'll only use your right hand. If you're a total beginner, then the first thing you need to do is to know your ""finger numbers"".


Your thumb is finger number 1.






Your pointer finger is finger number 2.






Your middle finger is finger number 3.






Your ring finger is finger number 4.






Your pinky finger is number 5.






You could write the numbers on your hand if you have trouble remembering them, but it's pretty easy. If you already know note names, then you don't need to know finger numbers.;
, For Jingle Bells, your hand position will be entirely in the Middle C position (you just need your right hand). To find Middle C, look at your piano or keyboard (or a picture if you don't have one) and notice that the black keys are in groups of two and three.

,, That key is called Middle C.

, This is called Middle C Position.

,

Here's how to play Jingle Bells if using finger numbers: 3 3 3 - 3 3 3 - 3 5 1 2 3 - - - 4 4 4 3 3 3 2 2 3 2 - 5 - 3 3 3 -3 3 3 - 3 5 1 2 3 - - - 4 4 4 3 3 3 5 5 4 2 1 - - -
All you have to do is play the finger with that finger number. When you come across a dash (-), then hold the note longer. Each - is one extra beat. For example, if there's 3 3 3 - then on the third 3, you hold the note for an extra beat.






If you know your Middle C note names (C D E F and G), then this is how you play Jingle Bells with note names: E E E - E E E - E G C D E - - - F F F E E E E D D E D - G - E E E - E E E - E G C D E - - - F F F E E E G G F D C - - -

To play this song you need to learn the chords.,
There are many inversions of these chords throughout the song.,
Keeping the inversion of the chord above, move the finger that is on G to F and the finger that was on E flat; to D flat;.,
Yet again, keep the chord that you played above.,
For each chord the note that is furthest to the right will be 1, the note furthest to the left is 3, and the note in the middle of notes 1 and 3 is 2.,
Go to the next chord, B flat; minor, and play the pattern 1-2-3, 1-2-3, 1-2, 1-2-3, 1-2-3, 1-2.,
Play the next chord, F minor, the same as you played the first chord with the pattern 1-2-3, 1-2-3, 1-2.

,
This whole pattern of all three chords is played throughout most of the song in the right hand.,
Your left hand will then go to octaves with a pattern of your pinky playing on 1 and your thumb on 2 and 3 going with the patterns of your right hand.,
For the chorus of the song you will continue your left hand pattern.,
Near the end of the chorus you will hear the singer sing ""Singing,"" you can then play the G above middle C when you hear ""Sing"" and the E flat; above middle C when you hear ""-ing."",
Near the end of the song you can hear that the left hand sounds like the beginning and that the right hand sounds much higher.,
For each chord the note that is furthest to the right will be 1, the note furthest to the left is 3, and the note in the middle of notes 1 and 3 is 2.,
Listen to the song to put all the pieces above together and you have ""Clocks"" by Coldplay.

,
Extra flavor you can add to the song.","How to Play ""Clocks"" by Coldplay on the Piano"," E flat major containing the notes E flat;, G, and B flat;. B flat; minor containing the notes B flat;, D flat;, and F. And F minor, which contains the notes F, A flat;, and C.;
, To start the song off play E flat; major in an inversion reading left to right the G above middle C, B flat;, and then E flat; with your right hand. It doesn't really matter what fingers you use to play the chords, but play with a fingering that feels most comfortable to you.

, Now you have the next chord B flat; minor reading, from left to right, the F above middle C, B flat;, and D flat;.

, Move the finger that is on B flat; to A flat; and the finger that is on D flat; to C. You may notice that with each chord you are only moving two fingers to make the next chord.

, Now play the first chord, E flat; major, in this manner 1-2-3, 1-2-3, 1-2.

, It is just like the pattern of the first chord only repeated.

,, Your left hand will play this pattern with your right hand twice when the song first starts.

, When your right hand plays Eb major your left hand will play an octave of E flat;. With the chord B flat; minor in the right hand, the left will play octaves of B flat;. And with the F minor chord in your right hand you will play an F octave in the left hand.

, Your right hand will keep the same chords you've been playing, but not in any particular pattern. Experiment with how you play the chords with your right hand. Try playing with each word that is sang in the chorus. You will have to listen to the song to find what you want to play and for when to change chords.

, These notes are not far away from the F minor chord you will be playing around this time in the song.

, This is because the right hand chords inversions change and move up. The E flat; chord now reads, from left to right, the E flat; an octave above middle C, G, and B flat;. B flat; minor now reads, from left to right,the D flat; an octave above middle C, F, and B flat;. F minor now reads from, from left to right, the C an octave above middle C, F, and A flat;.

, This is the same pattern as before only using different inversions of each chord: 1-2-3, 1-2-3, 1-2. For B flat; minor you will play the pattern twice like before.

,, You may notice that in the song you hear something different happening in the left hand while your right hand is playing the pattern for the B flat; chord. This starts with an octave of E flat; that is below the E flat; that you may have been playing normally. The octave will move up to a B flat; octave. You can play the B flat; octave twice. Your left thumb will play the C right above the B flat; you just played and if you can reach your left pinky can play B flat; with C. Put your thumb back on B flat; and play an octave again. Move down with your left hand to an A flat; octave then bring it down to a G octave and back up to the A flat; octave and hold.

Set the piano into place.",How to Move an Upright Piano," Call up friends, neighbors, and relatives and ask them if they’d be willing to help you move the piano. At minimum, aim for a group of four people in at least average physical shape, who are willing to spend one to two hours helping you with the move. The more helpers the better: Five people in average physical shape will be more effective than three people in above-average shape.Do not ask for help from anyone who has a history of back, leg, hip, or arm injuries.
Children should not help with piano moving.;
, Take some time to select an outfit that is comfortable and loose enough to be flexible. For example, pants that are too tight could tear as you squat to lift the piano. Wear athletic shoes or work boots with a treaded sole that grips floors and outdoor surfaces well. And use a pair of work gloves with rubber-treated palms to help you get a better grip on the piano.Don’t wear long jewelry, such as necklaces or bracelets, that could get caught in tight spaces while moving.
Do without excessively baggy clothing as well, since it too can get caught during the move., To protect the keys from damage during travel, put the lid down over the keyboard and lock it into place.If the lid does not have a lock, secure it with some tape that won’t remove the wood’s paint or stain, such as masking tape or electrical tape.

, Have at least two movers shift the piano back from the wall about 6 inches (15.2 centimeters) by pulling out the front legs. Using masking tape or electrical tape, secure moving blankets or other padded fabric to cover all painted and lacquered surfaces of the piano. The blankets will shield the piano from getting dented and scratched on the way to the moving truck and during the drive to your destination.


Some upright pianos have cylindrical moving handles attached to the outer frame of the back side. Be careful not to cover these with blankets, since you’ll need to access them when it’s time to lift the piano., Move aside any furniture or rugs that will get in the way of the piano as you roll it toward the exit door. If the door does not stay open on its own, have a mover or an extra helper hold it for you. Make sure any children are supervised during the move, and are clear of the exit path.

, If you’ll need to carry the piano down any porch steps, you’ll need to use a metal stair ramp. These can be rented from moving companies, sometimes from the same company you may be renting a moving van from. Put all ramps, including the moving van’s loading ramp, in place before starting the move.To find a stair ramp, look up “Moving Equipment Rental” in a telephone directory or online search.

, Use a 4-wheel dolly that is at least half the length of the piano.Center the dolly underneath the piano a couple of inches (about 5 centimeters) from the pedals. Position one mover at each end of the piano, and one in front to help steady the piano onto the dolly. A fourth mover can act as a “spotter” who points out potential collisions with walls or furniture, and holds open doors if needed., The movers on either end of the piano can grip the corners underneath the ends of the keyboard with their left hand, and the handle behind the piano with their right hand. The person in the front of the piano should stand just behind the dolly and grip underneath the keyboard.


If there are no handles on the back side of the piano, there should be a horizontal board near the middle or top of the frame that can be gripped instead. If it is near the top of the frame, push upward with your palm to lift.

, The movers on each end of the piano should begin lifting from a squatting position. This will allow the legs to do most of the lifting and prevent back strain. Do a “1-2-3” count, and then lift the piano high enough to clear the height of the dolly. The person in front of the piano will support and guide the piano only once it is lifted, backing up and helping the other two to place the base of the piano squarely centered onto the dolly.Take care never to support the weight of the piano on one or both of its thin front legs. This can be avoided by tilting the piano slightly back when lifting it., Using moving straps or rope, tie the piano down to the dolly. Pass the straps or rope underneath the dolly and over the top of the piano, and tighten the strap ratchet or tie the rope knot at the piano’s back side. There should be enough tension so that when one end of the piano is lifted, the dolly moves with it., The movers at each end of the piano should guide it slowly through the residence to the threshold of the exit. Be careful to stabilize the piano while going over any bumps or dips in the ground. The person who was lifting at the front of the piano can now help the “spotter” with guiding the piano.

, At the exit’s threshold, lift the lead end of the piano slightly and push from the back end until the dolly’s first pair of wheels clears the bump. Then the mover on the side that is still inside the residence lifts their end slightly, while the person on the lead end pulls slowly backward until the second pair of wheels clears the bump., If you have front or back porch steps and are using a ramp, position two movers at the front end of the piano and one at the back. The two movers at the front will catch its weight as you roll it down the ramp, and the person at the back end will guide it downwards from the top of the ramp.


Proceed slowly on the ramp, taking small steps as you push and pull the piano down onto the pavement.
Have spotters look out for cracks or separations in the pavement as you roll the piano to the truck ramp. Avoid these if possible, otherwise push the dolly slowly over them.

, Position the two strongest movers at the back end of the piano, another at the lead end, and one alongside the ramp at the back side of the piano.As the movers at the back end push the piano up the ramp, the person at the lead end guides the front end up into the truck.The person at the side of the ramp is there to stabilize the piano in case it starts to tilt back perpendicularly to the ramp.

, Roll the piano against a wall in the truck. Using moving straps, fasten the piano lengthwise to the support bars or rails along the truck’s interior wall. Make sure the straps are tightened to the point that the piano can’t be shifted more more than an inch (2.54 centimeters)., Once at your destination, undo the straps that were securing the piano to the truck wall. At the top of the truck ramp, position two movers at the lead end of the piano, one at the back end, and one alongside the ramp at the back side of the piano. Slowly guide the piano down the ramp.

, Use a stair ramp again if the residence has a high porch, and push the piano up the ramp with two movers at the back end, and one at the lead end guiding it up the ramp. Then slowly lift the dolly wheels one pair at a time over the threshold of the entrance.

, Carefully move the piano through the new residence to its intended location. Remove the straps or rope that were securing it to the dolly, then push it back against the wall. With one mover on each end of the piano, and a third holding the dolly, lift the piano from a squatting position off the dolly. The person holding the dolly should then pull it back and clear of the piano. The movers at each end can then lower the piano very slowly to the ground.

Note that the terminology in this article is Maguindanaon.,
The Maguindanaon people use an eight-gong set (the ""kulintang"" gongs) which is laid upon a wooden stand (the ""antangan"").,
A kulintang instrument is composed of both the kulintang gongs and the antangan.",How to Make a Kulintang Stand1," There are dozens of cultures indigenous to the islands of Mindanao, the Sulu Archipelago, and Borneo, and each culture has its own name for the kulintang set and for the kulintang stand. Likewise, each culture has its own traditional style of playing these instruments.;
, These instructions are for the most basic and simple kulintang.

, The antangan is the resonator for the kulintang gongs.

You will need to take careful measurements with the set of gongs in order to determine the exact sizes of wood you will need to make the stand.

,
Lay the gongs in a straight line on a padded level surface, such as a carpeted floor, or a towel on a tabletop.,
There should be about a one inch space between each gong, as they sit in a straight row.,
Once the gongs are placed in row with about one inch space between each gong, measure the length of the set of kulintang gongs.,
Measure the diameter of the #1 (largest) gong.,
You may use any type of sturdy wood for the basic antangan frame.,
The two long pieces should each have a length equal to Measurement ""L"" plus an additional two inches.,
The two short pieces should have one dimension equal to Measurement ""W"".",How to Make a Kulintang Stand2,",


The largest (#1) gong should be at the far left, then the next largest gong, then the next, etc., until the smallest gong (#8) is at the end, at the far right.

,


Note that the widest part of the gong is at the top edge, not at the base of the gong, so the space between the bases of two adjacent gongs will be more than one inch wide.

,


Measure from the outside edge of the #1 (largest) gong to the other side of the #8 (smallest) gong.
Typically, the length will be approximately 4 to 5 feet (approximately 1.2 to 1.5 meters).
Add two inches to your measurement, and that will be the inside lengthwise dimension (Measurement ""L"") for the antangan.

,


Add two inches to your measurement, and that will be the inside width (Measurement ""W"") for the antangan.

, #*There is no standard size for kulintang gongs, nor is there a standard size of wood for the antangan.


You will need two long pieces, and two short pieces. Feel free to use recycled wood.

,


The width should be about 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm).
The height should be about 8 inches (20.3 cm).

,


The width should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm).
The other dimension should be about 30 inches (76.2 cm), as the end pieces of the antangan will also serve as legs.
When the kulintang gongs are placed on the antangan, the kulintang should be easily played by a person sitting on a standard-size stool or armless-chair.

"
"
Take one of the short pieces of wood at the end and place it along the inside of one of the 8-inch surfaces of the long pieces of wood.,
Attach the other short piece to the other end of the long piece.

,
Attach the other long piece to the assembly.

,
Turn the frame upside down, so that the two end legs are on the ground and the 8-inch ""box"" is at the top.

",How to Make a Kulintang Stand3," #*The first 8 inches (20.3 cm) of the 30-inch piece of wood (the short piece) will be alongside the long piece of wood, and at a 90-degree angle. # Place the two pieces on the floor, with the 22-inch long ""leg"" pointing away from the ground, and carefully screw in three of the wood screws.


Each screw will enter into the long piece of wood at about 1/2-inch from the end and along the 8-inch surface, then all the way through the 3/4-inch surface of the long piece, then into the 1-inch surface of the short piece.

,,,"
"
First, screw in the cup hooks, two at each end of the frame, at the top of the short pieces.,
Measure out the cotton or nylon cord so that it is about 12 inches (30.5 cm) plus lengthwise measurement plus width plus another lengthwise measurement plus width.

,
Cut the cord, and use the cup hooks to guide the cord into a long rectangle.

,
Pull the cord taut and tie it into a ""circle"" -- a rectangular-shaped circle.

,
Measure out two or three more pieces of cord, about 12 inches (30.5 cm) long.

,
Eyeball the cord rectangle, and at the halfway point of the length, tie a piece of cord which is loose enough to not affect the distance between the two long ends of the cord rectangle, but tight enough that it will prevent the two long ends from spreading apart.

,
Do the same at the quarter-point, and the three-quarter point (a photos is needed to show this step).

,
Carefully place the largest gong on the cord rectangle, with a space of about 1 inch (2.5 cm) between the left interior of the antangan frame and the top rim of the gong.

,
UNDER the cord rectangle, and at about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the right side of the top rim of the gong, place the end of the 48-inch-long 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) X 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) wood flush against the outer edge of the long piece of wood, and use a pencil to mark on the wood where it crosses the other outer edge of the other long piece of wood.

,
Cut the wood, and leave it on the top of the frame of the antangan.

,
Remove the gong, and then place the next largest gong on the antangan.

,
Measure and cut the next separator, to the right of that gong.,
Once those seven separators have been cut, measure and cut a separator for the two far ends of the frame.,
Using a permanent marker such as a Sharpie, mark the separators as follows: 0 for the one furthest to the left, 1 for the one to the right, etc., to the end at the far right which should be marked 8.

,
If you anticipate using just that set of gongs with that antangan, you can mark on the antangan frame where each of the separators will be located.,
Place all eight gongs on the cord rectangle, with the wood separators providing support at the ends and in-between each gong.

",How to Make a Kulintang Stand4,"


Divide the space at the end (the width) into thirds, and screw a cup hook at the point that is 1/3, and another at the point that is 2/3.
Do the same for the other end.
The hooks should be positioned so that the open part of the hook faces away from the center of the frame.

,,,,,,,,,,, Continue until there are seven separators that have been cut, to go between the eight gongs.

, These last separators will act as spacers, and will rest very close to the cup hooks at each end.

,,


You can either use a Sharpie, a pencil, or attach a sticky Velcro dot.
If you really don't expect to ever use another kulintang set with that antangan, after you have used the gongs a few times with the antangan, and you are comfortable with the placement of the separators, you can nail the separators into the frame

Know your piano.,
Plan your route.,
Prepare the piano.,
Move the piano.",How to Move a Piano1," The spinet piano is the smallest type of piano commonly seen in homes. Manufactured from the 1930s on through the end of the 20th century, a spinet piano's compact size is achieved by clever engineering of the key mechanisms inside. Spinet pianos are not very tall, topping out at about 3 feet (0.9 m) in height, and they are generally 58 inches (147.3 cm) long, the same as other types of upright piano.


Despite their relatively small size, they usually weigh at least 300 pounds, making the job of moving them a team effort not to be undertaken lightly.;
, Have a clear route from start to finish in mind before you begin to move the piano, and communicate it to everyone who is helping you move.


Using a tape measure, ensure that the spinet will fit through every door or opening you plan to move it through.
If the piano is being moved out of the house to a moving truck, have the truck open and any moving ramps deployed in advance of the move, and plan to move the piano before any other, lighter furniture so that there is plenty of room for your team to maneuver it into place.
For safety reasons, one person per 100 pounds is recommended for this and all upright piano moves. This may work out to more people than are strictly needed, but extra personnel can help in other ways (such as opening doors), and can step in should somebody start to get worn out.

, Lock down the spinet's lid and the keyboard lid, if there is one. Wrap the piano in thick blankets or special moving blankets and use packing tape to secure the blankets around the piano. This will prevent scuffing on the finish and corners.

, A spinet's low profile makes for a relatively easy move. Using as much help as you deem necessary, have each person lift up a different part of the piano at the same time. Be sure that everyone is lifting from firmly underneath the body of the piano. In small, measured steps, walk the piano to its destination.


Never move the piano more than a few feet without stopping to reset your grip.

Bring out the sheet music, study it closely.,
Decide to learn two or three bars at a time, depending on how difficult it is.,
Play the RIGHT hand part, while looking at the sheet music.,
Now turn away the sheet music, and play the very same part again.,
Repeat step 3 and 4 for the LEFT hand, and repeat the very same steps for BOTH hands together.

,
Apply this for the rest of the piece, up to five bars at a time (Go easy!),
For perfecting the passages between bars, do like so.,
Now try to get the entire piece done, first while looking at the sheet music and get it right 4 times with, and then 4 times without after turning the sheet music away.

,Now that you know the actual notes you need to play and the keys you need to press, work on the emotion of the piece!",How to Memorize a Piano Piece," How difficult is it for your level? Realise that you cannot master Liszt's Liebesträum if you've only played for a year, as it requires very advanced techniques and precision.;
, If you feel it's very difficult, then try one or two bars at a time. Likewise, if you feel that it's quite simple, challenge your memory and learn up to five at a time.

, Play it slowly, don't rush! Your finger muscles need to remember in what way they moved when playing each note and phrase, and it takes time. Once you can play this without any mistakes, at a reasonable pace, repeat until you have played it perfectly 3 times in a row. Also make sure to look at the sheet music closely, your mind needs to develop it as a photographic memory.

, Once you have played it perfectly, repeat until you have played it perfectly 3 times in a row.

Be sure you have proper kulintang beaters.,
Kulintang beaters made in the Philippines are made from two kinds of tropical wood not found in the Western Hemisphere.

,
If you are in the U.S. and do not have proper kulintang beaters, go to Ace Hardware and find a nice 36-inch long piece of 1-inch X 1-inch balsa wood (used by train hobbyists).

,
Cut the balsa into pieces about 16 inches (40.6 cm) long, and take away the straight/square edges with an Exacto knife with a concave edge.

,
Use thin-mil package tape, or 3M Transparent tape, to cover the balsa wood, to give the sticks durability.

Know your piano.,
Plan your route.,
Prepare the piano.,
Move the piano.",How to Move a Piano2," One the most common types of piano today is the upright piano. These pianos are both normally 58 inches (147.3 cm) wide, and despite their differences, both the full vertical and the smaller studio upright can be moved using essentially the same method.


The smaller ""studio"" uprights usually weigh between 400 and 600 pounds.
The monstrous ""full vertical"" or large upright piano can weigh as much as half a ton.
A studio piano's center of gravity is also lower than a large upright's, as it is about 4 feet (1.2 m) tall as opposed to a large upright's roughly 5-foot height.

, Begin by clearing a path to your destination and measuring all entrances to ensure that the piano will fit through them.


Have your moving truck open with the ramp deployed, if you are moving the piano onto the truck.
Try to get one person per 100 pounds of estimated weight to help you move your piano.
Ensure that every member of your piano moving grew is wearing rugged leather work gloves, and if at all possible, thick weightlifting support belts to help prevent back strain.

, Unlike a spinet, these larger upright piano models are too top-heavy and bulky to reasonably move without tilting them onto a wide dolly. After you have locked the piano down and wrapped it in blankets and tape, move the dolly to one end of the piano and, with the help of your crew, gently lean it back onto the dolly.


As many people as possible should be at the dolly end of the piano, to support its weight as it tips back, and along the sides of the piano to keep it on an even keel. This is an especially important point to remember with large upright pianos, since they tend to be quite top-heavy.
Don't let gravity do any of your work for you; ease the piano gently using manpower from beginning to end.

, With your crew supporting the weight of the piano according to its center of gravity, lead it slowly by the dolly to its destination.


If the piano is too high on the dolly to move through a doorway, it will have to be lifted and scooted slowly through the door a few inches at a time. Once it is through the doorway, be sure it is settled firmly on the dolly before continuing to move it.
The proper way to lift any object is to squat, maintain a straight back, and lift with your legs. Be sure everyone who is helping you move knows to lift this way.
If the piano feels out of balance at any time, yell “Stop!” and instruct everyone to gently set the piano down. Make any required adjustments to the position of the dolly or your crew and try again.

Know your piano.,
Plan your route.,
Prepare the piano.,
Move the piano.",How to Move a Piano3," A grand piano is long and low, which improves its sound over an upright but also causes it to take up a lot more floor space. For this reason, grand pianos are rarely seen in private homes.


Grand pianos, like uprights, are divided by size into “petite” grand pianos, which can weigh as little as 500 pounds, on to standard grands, and finally “concert” grand pianos, the largest pianos of all, which can weigh as much as 1300 pounds and measure more than 9 feet (2.7 m) across. However, moving a grand piano of any size requires the same basic steps.

, As always, clearing the way and taking measurements are the first steps to a successful grand piano move.


Because of the grand piano's bulk, it is generally moved on-end, so double check that any doors you plan to move your piano through are tall enough to accommodate its front-to-back length, with several inches to spare.
If the piano is too deep to fit through a door with several inches of clearance to spare, professional help will be required.

, This is where moving a grand piano becomes much more complicated than moving an upright. The safest way to move a grand piano (and the way that professional movers do it) is to load it onto a rolling skid board, which is basically a load-bearing board on wheels. With as many people as possible on hand to assist you, lift the bass corner of the piano and unscrew or otherwise remove the leg there. Gently set the piano down and secure the removed leg in blankets; then, with the help of your crew, blanket and tape the body and remaining legs of the piano itself.


Equipment rental shops should be able to rent you a skid board if you don't own one.
Be sure that the top of the piano is securely locked down, as well as the keyboard cover.

, Carefully lift the piano from the back end upward, while simultaneously lifting the keyboard end off the ground as evenly as possible. Once the piano is balanced on the skid board, it can be moved by slowly pushing it from the rear end while pulling from the front end. Extra helpers should stand on either side of the piano to help keep it upright in case of bumps and wobbles.


The goal is to set the piano vertically on the skid board with the left side (bass side) down on the board, so that the treble side of the piano points skyward and the keyboard is vertical.
Remember that the piano gets heavier toward the bass end, which means the center of balance is likely to be closer to that end than the other.

Get professional help.,
Use whatever equipment you can get.,
Learn about the staircase.,
Support the low end.,
Move slowly.,
Beware of landings.",How to Move a Piano4," By far the safest and surest way to move a piano up or down flights of stairs is by hiring professional piano movers. A piano's large size, incredible weight, and unclear center of gravity make it a dangerous item to move through vertical space for those who are not experts.

, Visit an equipment rental store and talk to a knowledgeable clerk there about the size and weight of your piano to help decide what setup will be best for your move.


A piano dolly or furniture dolly with straps can help make a move up a flight of stairs much easier.
Specially designed piano skids are also a sensible option.

, Find out whatever information you can about its age, design, and composition. In some cases, a staircase may not be able to properly support a 700-pound piano and four or five grown movers all at once, in which case the move should be aborted. It is better to know ahead of time than risk causing severe property damage and possible injury.

, If, for whatever reason, you decide not to get professional assistance moving your piano up or down a building, remember that the downward-pointing end of the piano will carry even more of the piano's overall weight on a staircase than it does on flat ground.


The majority of people helping you move the piano should be at the lower 50% of the piano at all times to help keep it stable. However, nobody should stand directly behind the piano without plenty of room to step aside, since one slip from another crew member could mean being crushed underneath its weight.
Ensure that everyone can easily step to the side if control over the piano is lost.

, Even more so than during a flat move, taking regular breaks to readjust and catch your breath is vital during a staircase piano move. Plan to stop at each new step, gently set the piano down, reset your grip, and lift for the next step. By being slow and methodical, you will ensure a solid grip from beginning to end and minimize the risk of injury.

, At each landing, even on skids or a special piano dolly, it is possible that the piano will have to be turned on-end or otherwise manipulated in order to turn the corner. A few strong and well-balanced people can make the turn. Just be sure that everyone has as much room as possible and is planted firmly on both feet.

Learn about the keyboard.,
Play scales.,
Learn to read music.,
Practice using your hands independently.",How to Learn to Play the Organ1," Before you can learn to play the organ, you must have some experience on the piano. In fact, many organ teachers will not accept you without at least one year of piano training. Begin your journey by learning about the keyboard on the piano. You must first understand what the various keys do, and which notes they can produce.


The keyboard of a piano repeats its notes from top to bottom across several octaves. This means that the notes change from low (left side) to high (right side), but don't vary in pitch.
There are twelve notes a piano can produce: seven white key notes (C, D, E, F, G, A, B) and five black key notes (C-sharp, D-sharp, F-sharp, A-flat, and B-flat).;
, Playing scales (a series of notes) is the cornerstone of mastering piano technique. Learn some basic piano scales, starting with simple two-finger scales and then advancing to three-finger scales. Practice your piano scales every day.

, As organ is considered an advanced instrument, most teachers will expect you to be able to read sheet music before you begin organ study. Learning to read music can be challenging at first, but it is a crucial skill for mastering any musical instrument, including piano and organ.


Learn about the treble clef.
Move on to the bass clef.
Learn about the parts of the note (the note head, the stem, the flag).
Learn about meter and rhythm.

, Once you have become comfortable with piano scales, and perhaps started playing some simple compositions, you must learn to use each of your hands independently. Eventually, you must be able to play two different movements (one with each hand) at the same time. This simultaneous playing must be mastered before you can advance to organ play.

"
"
Find an organ teacher.,
Gain access to an organ.,
Purchase an introductory level organ book.,
Buy a pair of organ shoes.",How to Learn to Play the Organ2," Inquire at local churches, colleges, or music shops. Many colleges have undergraduate programs in applied organ, and music theory in general. You can also check organ-related periodicals for teachers. But the best way is to contact your local chapter of The American Guild of Organists, and search for a teacher through them. If you choose to talk to a local Church Organist, make sure that they are well-qualified to teach.When you make contact with a teacher, be sure to find out if you meet their minimum requirements to begin lessons (for example, ability to sight read and/or a certain level of experience on the piano).

, In order to learn the organ, you will need to practice outside of your lessons. An organ is a large and expensive instrument, so before you can begin serious organ study, you must ensure that you have access to a practice instrument. Speak to your instructor about the possibility of practicing at the studio, inquire at local churches, or obtain a small (or digital) organ for home.

, An introduction to organ book will help you to study the basics alongside what you learn during your lessons. Most music stores will carry such a book. Speak to your organ instructor about a book they recommends to work well alongside their teaching.

, Pedals are a unique aspect of organ playing, and having the proper footwear will help you develop efficient technique. Additionally, since you will only be wearing your organ shoes when sitting at the organ, they will not pick up dirt or grime which can damage the pedals.You can purchase them online for around sixty dollars.
Some instructors may require you to have proper organ shoes before you can play on their organ.

"

Begin taking lessons.,
Study pedal technique.,
Practice legato playing.,
Practice!",How to Learn to Play the Organ3," The organ is a difficult instrument. As such, you will benefit greatly from professional instruction. Once you have located a teacher in your area, create a regular schedule of lessons (such as, twice a week). Find out if there is anything you must bring with you to each lesson. Organize your other life obligations so that they do not conflict with your lesson times., The primary difference between piano and organ is the introduction of a third voice, by way of the foot pedals. To play organ, you must practice proper pedal form and technique. Work to keep your heels together at all times. Additionally, your knees should also be touching. Finally, play on the inside of your foot, which means turning your ankle in., With the organ, you do not want there to be any space between notes. You likewise do not want to the notes to overlap. This is known as “legato playing.” Legato playing also involves a technique called “trapping the note.” This means holding a key down with one finger so that you can advance to another key (note) with a different finger. For example, if you initially press a key down with your first finger, you may need to use your thumb to keep that key down, so that your first finger can advance to another key. Work your way across the keyboard and back to master this technique and achieve a legato effect.Begin practicing legato playing using only the white keys. Once you feel comfortable with this, work to incorporate the black keys.
When you feel comfortable playing legato with your hands, advance to practicing your legato playing with both hands and feet.

, There is only one way to master any instrument: practice, practice, practice. Create a daily practice schedule for yourself and stick with it. The more practice you can put in, the more you will get out of it.

Follow a reliable practice schedule.,
Adjust the technique mentioned in the previous step if you are learning a very difficult piece of music or a challenging exercise.",How to Learn the Piano Keyboard," Websites such as Go Piano have free online lessons complete with letters indicating the names of keys written on a keyboard. After seeing the online illustration, determining the rest of the notes is easy. They are a continuation of the pattern of notes previously written---G-A-B-C-D-E-F-G, G-A-B-C-D-E-F-G, and so on.

, John Thompson offers one such method book, and several books are in that series. Other method books include those produced by Hal Leonard, and the Belwin Piano Method by June Weybright.
, Check your method book to see if there is a keyboard printed in it, and write the names of the notes on that keyboard page.
, Start with a simple scale like C major. Starting at middle C, play two octaves using only your right hand. As you progress, playing more complex scales in keys like A major and G minor will help increase your knowledge.
, Also called ""broken chords,"" arpeggios can be played using the entire keyboard, even if you are a beginning student. By practicing, you become accustomed to playing all the octaves and hear more notes than you would just playing a two- or three-octave scale.

, Start out with only one or two octaves, and then progress to three or more. As you improve, using higher-level method books like the Hanon Virtuoso Pianist series will help you develop better technique and dexterity.

, Start off with simple ones. As you improve, start playing pieces that you like that may not be in your method book. These may be songs on the radio or music heard at a concert.

, When you begin a new exercise or piece of music, start off playing it slowly using a metronome. After the first two days of slow practicing, begin to gradually speed up the metronome so that you ultimately are able to play the music at tempo by the time you have your next lesson.

, The more slow practicing you do, the better your fingers will remember where to go, even if your playing is a little rushed during a performance because of nervousness.

Notes range from A to G ascendingly, so letters increase moving to the right on the keyboard (as in A → B → C) and decease moving to the left (as in C → B → A). Furthermore:Once you reach the end or beginning of the note sequence, it repeats. So when moving to the right up the keyboard, G → A → B, whereas moving to the left yields A → G → F.
The 36 black keys on the keyboard represent a half-step difference in tone between white key notes. A sharp (♯) is a half-step up, and a flat (♭) a half-step down.

Most black key notes have two different possible names. For example, the black note between F and G could either be called both F# or G♭.Easily locate the C note on your keyboard by finding the white key immediately to the left of a group of two black keys. The C key closest to the middle of your keyboard should be middle C, which is a central note for most beginner level songs.;
, In many songs, you'll find small numbers above or below notes. These numbers indicate the recommended finger you should use to play the note. Very basic songs many have finger notation for each note, while more complex songs may have little finger notation. Each number represents a single finger:


1: represents your thumb
2: represents your index (pointer) finger
3: represents your middle finger
4: represents your ring finger
5: represents your pinky, When first beginning, you may find it a little difficult to play a finger when you read its number. This is common, but by learning finger notation thoroughly, so it is automatic, you'll find playing easier.


Many beginning students find scale drills an effective way of learning proper finger positioning.
A scale is an uninterrupted run of notes, usually in 8 note increments, that moves up or down through a musical key.
As many basic piano songs have a lot of finger notation to assist beginners, you may want to make use of these resources to practice., Keep your fingers slightly curved but firm so that when you press a key your finger does not bend backwards at all. Your thumb and pinky fingers especially will want to lie flat, but keep these raised as well.Try to keep your arms and shoulders relaxed as you play. This will enable you to use more of your entire body while playing and will help you achieve a better sound from the keyboard.
As you press a key, you should feel the weight from your arm transferring down into the key through your fingers.
Although you might think that the position of your fingers doesn't affect your playing much, proper form will allow more freedom and nuance in your playing., In music, the staff refers to a set of five horizontal lines on which notes are written. Piano generally has two staffs, one for the treble clef and the other for the bass clef. The top staff normally indicates right hand notes, and the bottom staff left hand notes.


You can find the treble clef by looking to the far left of the staff. It will look similar to an ""&"" symbol. This clef is usually the upper of the two clefs.
Find the bass clef on the left side of the staff. It will look like a backwards ""C"" followed by a colon ( : ). It is usually the lower of the two clefs.
Notes that are especially high or low on the staff in either clef are represented by additional lines added to the staff, called ledger lines.
In some cases, like when playing songs with only very high notes, you have two treble clefs or, for low songs, two bass clefs.In these cases, the bottom clef will represent your left hand., Each line and space on the staff represents a single note on the keyboard. However, the way you read these lines and spaces will depend on whether you're in the treble or bass clef.


Each bold letter in the following indicates the ascending order of notes for lines and spaces in the treble clef:Lines: Every Good Boy Deserves Fudge.Spaces: F A C E

Each bold letter in the following indicates the ascending order of notes for lines and spaces in the bass clef:Lines: Good Boys Do Fine Always.Spaces: All Cars Eat Gas., There are 12 major and 12 minor keys in music. The key of your song will be indicated by either sharp (♯) or flat (♭) symbols following the treble and bass clef in the staff, or it may have no symbol. These indicate that certain notes (or no notes) are always naturally played as either sharp or flat notes (black keys) in a song or certain part of a song.


When there are no sharps or flats, the key is C and all natural notes are played on white keys. The relative minor of C major is A.
Generally, with each sharp/flat added to the key signature, a previously white key note becomes a black key note.

Major keys: G (one sharp), D (two sharps), A (three), E (four), B (five), F# (six), C# (seven), C♭ (seven flats), G♭ (six flats), D♭ (five), A♭ (four), E♭ (three), B♭ (two), F♭ (one).

Minor keys: E (one sharp), B (two sharps), F# (three), C# (four), G# (five), D# (six), E♭ (six flats), B♭ (five flats), F (four), C (three), G (two), D (one)., You may have noticed that certain notes have special shapes. These tell you how many beats you need to hold that note in a measure. A measure is indicated by a vertical line through the staff. The space between vertical staff lines (or a vertical line and the staff beginning or end) equals a single measure.The following basic note rhythms express the main beats in a measure with numbers, same-beat broken rhythms with X's, and separates beats with plus signs (+).


Sixteenth note: is held for a quarter of a beat (as in 1-x-x-x+2-x-x-x+3-x-x-x+4-x-x-x | 1-x-x-x...)
Eighth note (♪): is held for half a beat (as in 1-x+2-x+3-x+4-x | 1-x+2-x...)
Quarter note (♩): is held for one beat (as in 1+2+3+4 | 1+2...)
Half note: is held for two beats (as in 1-2+3-4 | 1-2 + 3-4...)
Whole note: is held for four beats (as in 1-2-3-4 | 1-2-3-4...), The time signature will be represented by a fraction following the clef of each staff. For most beginning level songs, this number will likely be 4/4. The top number indicates how many beats are in each measure, and the bottom number represents which note equals a full beat.


As the top number lets you know beats per measure, each measure in 4/4 time gets four beats (as in 1+2+3+4 | 1+2+3+4...). In 3/4 time, you'll have three beats per measure (as in 1+2+3 | 1+2+3...), and so on.
Add a one on top of the bottom number of the time signature to find which note equals a single beat. Normally, this will be 1/4, meaning that a quarter note stands for a whole beat. However:

In cut time (2/2 time), this number is 1/2, so a half note equals a single beat, a whole note two beats, a quarter note half a beat, and so on. In this way, note rhythms can sometimes change., A rest is a pause in music. Much like musical notes, rests also have rhythm markings to help you determine how long or short to hold the rest. Rest rhythms follow the same pattern as notes, so the basic rests also include:


Sixteenth rests: pause for a quarter of a beat
Eighth rests: pause for a half of a beat
Quarter rests: pause for a beat
Half rests: pause for two beats
Whole rests: pause for four beats, An ""accidental"" is another name for sharp (♯), flat (♭), and natural (♮) symbols. When an accidental is written, all notes on that line/space for that measure are also changed, unless the sharp or flat is removed with a natural mark (♮). After a measure, all sharped, flatted, or natural notes return to normal.


Natural marks can also remove the natural sharps or flats of the key you are in. For example, in the key of D major, the notes F and C are always sharped, even without an accidental.Applying a natural to these notes would remove the sharp for a measure.

, If you are a true beginner, a beginning level practice book, lesson book series, or primer can provide you with simple songs that help you practice piano basics. These books often include liberal finger notation, which will help you master proper finger position.


You can find basic piano materials at your local music store, book store, or through an online retailer.
If you have some music experience, you may want to visit a music store to ask a knowledgeable representative about what book to start with.
With enough time and dedication, even beginners can learn moderate to difficult songs. However, be mindful that difficult songs could be too difficult for your level and lead you to getting discouraged., When first learning a song, accidentals (like sharps (♯), flats (♭), and naturals (♮)) can take you by surprise. Highlight these so you don't miss them. Furthermore, you may want to:


Circle or highlight fingering that looks difficult or is unusual. In particular, beginners often struggle with interval jumps (like from C to F).
Write in the note names for notes written on ledger lines above or below the staff, as these can also be difficult to read., First, divide the music into manageable sections. This will be different for each person, though you might want to consider tackling your song one measure at a time or in five measure segments. Then:


Play through the right hand. Play slowly, with a steady rhythm, until you have completed the section you are working on.
Practice this until you can play the notes smoothly to a steady beat. Repeat your single handed play through with your left hand.
Consider using a metronome, set to a slow tempo, to help you keep a steady beat. This can help you get a better feel for rhythm.As your playing improves, increase the speed at which you play. As you increase your speed, you should start to hear the melody of the song come together., After your one handed play through, you may have noticed certain parts of the song give you more difficulty than others. For example, there may be a large interval (like an 8-note jump) or a run of fast notes (like 10 eighth notes in a row), and so on. Isolate and practice these until you can play smoothly and without hesitation.


Switch between hands when practicing so you don't tire out one hand more than the other.
If you notice you consistently have trouble with certain parts of music, like with large interval jumps or runs, you may want to drill these. Drills can be found in most practice books or online., Much as you did when starting one hand at a time, start putting your left and right hands together slowly. Make it a goal to play left and right hand notes that fall on the beat together.


As your hands become more familiar with the song and play it more fluidly, increase the speed until you are playing the song at a normal pace.
More complex rhythms, like combinations of eighth and sixteenth notes, might take more time to come together.
Some basic music books may teach treble and bass clefs one at a time to encourage mastering each hand before putting hands together., Learning new songs will challenge your ability to read music, which will help improve your sight reading ability. Beyond that, the more often you play the more familiar the keyboard will be beneath your fingers, which will lead to better playing.Many songs, especially older ones, have become public domain. This means the song is free for everyone. Search for free public domain sheet music for songs online.

, Your piano bench should be positioned so that when sitting on the front half of it your elbows are a little in front of your body. Your arms should be level with or slightly sloping down toward the keys. Your feet should be flat on the floor.For most benches, you'll find that you can adjust the height by turning a knob mechanism or pressing a spring release under or behind the bench., Sit tall and with a slight inward lean to the piano when playing. This might seem unimportant, but your posture at the keyboard can greatly affect the sound you produce. A straight spine will allow you greater stability and poise. It also will enable you to more easily involve your upper body weight when playing, which will help you create a more dynamic sound.Beyond the technical complications created by poor keyboard posture, slouching can also negatively impact your presence when playing., It can be difficult to notice poor posture in yourself. If you are teaching yourself piano, you might want to ask a friend or family member to check your posture from time to time. Make sure you let them know what to look for when it comes to proper piano posture.


If you have a consistent posture problem, you might want to set up a full length mirror to the side of your bench. This way, periodically while playing, you can look over and check your own posture."

If your sheet music has bass clef in the right hand, you can skip this part of the process.;
, The key signature comes right after the treble clef. This will consist of flats and sharps of different notes. There are also orders of flats and sharps to help you determine the key signature quickly and easily. The order of flats is B - E - A - D - G - C - F. The order of sharps is the same as the order of flats, but reversed. The order is then F - C - G - D - A - E - B. For example:


Remember that a sharp looks like '#' and a flat looks like 'b'
Notice the key signature has 3 flats. Therefore, B, E, and A will all be flat.
Notice the key signature has 6 flats. Therefore, B, E, A, D, G, and C will be flat.
Notice the key signature has 2 sharps. Therefore, F and C will be sharp.
Notice the key signature has 5 sharps. Therefore, F, C, G, D, and A will be sharp.

, The time signature is the two numbers at the beginning of the line. The top number will indicate how many of the lower-number notes are in each bar. For example:


4 / 4 will have FOUR QUARTER note beats
5 / 8 will have FIVE EIGHTH note beats
12 / 8 will have TWELVE EIGHTH note beats
A ""C"" with a line through it means cut time where you only have 2 half note beats per measure

, There are 5 lines which indicate these notes in order from bottom to top: E - G - B - D - F. Then, in between those lines, you have F - A - C - E.


If a note is above the staff (above the five lines) the pattern of notes continues as shown above

, Again, it is possible to have treble clef in the left hand (lower line). If that is the case, you can refer back to Part 1 to understand the rhythms and time signatures.

, The key signature shouldn't be different from the treble clef's signature if your right hand is treble clef. To determine what notes are flat and sharp, you can refer to the order of flats and sharps. The order of flats is B - E - A - D - G - C - F. The order of sharps is the same as the order of flats, but reversed. The order is then F - C - G - D - A - E - B. For example:


Remember that a sharp looks like '#' and a flat looks like 'b'
Notice the key signature has 3 flats. Therefore, B, E, and A will all be flat.
Notice the key signature has 6 flats. Therefore, B, E, A, D, G, and C will be flat.
Notice the key signature has 2 sharps. Therefore, F and C will be sharp.
Notice the key signature has 5 sharps. Therefore, F, C, G, D, and A will be sharp.

, Again, this is no different than the treble clef's. The time signature is the two numbers at the beginning of the line. The top number will indicate how many of the lower-number notes are in each bar. For example:


4 / 4 will have FOUR QUARTER note beats
5 / 8 will have FIVE EIGHTH note beats
12 / 8 will have TWELVE EIGHTH note beats
A ""C"" with a line through it means cut time where you only have 2 half note beats per measure

, For bass clef, there are still 5 lines, but different notes to go with them. Starting from the bottom line to the top, G - B - D - F - A. The lines in between will be A - C - E - G.


If a note is above the staff (above the five lines) the pattern of notes continues as shown above

, Now you can continue to start reading sheet music. It is essential to learn the difference between a single note and a chord. A chord will be multiple notes stacked on top of each other. This simply means that you must play all of those notes at once to play the chord.

, There are a lot of different types of notes that correlate to different rhythms.

, Dynamics are letters that generally appear between the lines of the right and left hand.


p - piano - softly
mp - mezzo piano - slightly louder piano
mf - mezzo forte - slightly louder than mp
f - forte - a loud talking voice

, There are lots of different kinds of articulation that signify a lot of things.


1 - Staccato - played very short and to the point
2 - Slurs - played so that the notes don't have any gaps of sound between them
3 - Tepee - Played short but with ""umph""
4 - Accent - Played with force at front
5 - Legato - played triumphantly to the notes extent

, This last step is very tricky if you're just learning piano. A neat tip is that the notes/chords line up from right to left hand. The notes in the picture above shows that.

Work on your technique.,
Improve your posture.,
Play on a piano with heavy keys.,
Play common phrases often.,
If you find any phrase hard, play it again and again and again.,
Consistently play single phrases and slowly speed them up.

,
Keep practicing!,
Exercise.,
Utilize the metronome.",How to Improve Dexterity on the Piano," Your fingers should be spider like and and should glide across the piano. While this is much easier said than done, it greatly improves your speed and feel, when mastered.;
, Though as much for your own safety as anything else, an arched back helps lift your fingers from keys faster, helping you master difficult phrases.

, Though a lighter keyboard is, naturally, easier to play; you naturally strengthen your fingers by playing pianos with more resistance to the touch -- therefore, get used to these! Also, it can be unsettling playing a heavy keyboard for the first time in a graded exam or suchlike (spoken from experience!), and therefore it is often best to become accustomed to them so that playing one doesn't throw you.

, For example, in many pieces, the thumb crosses over the index finger -- therefore, practice that often so that you can do it consistently and effortlessly.

, Although it can be discouraging if you cannot play a phrase despite a lot of practice, if you don't learn it it will probably come back to haunt you! Also, playing harder phrases makes playing easier ones even easier!

,, Though it might be tiring to hear it, it is the best way to improve. Try to practice using all of your fingers when playing exercises; as very often people's fourth fingers are slower to move, and their fifths are lacking in strength as well. Even when on a bus/train or in a car, practice moving your fingers quickly - though as inconspicuously as possible to avoid funny looks!

, Another way of building finger strength is by trying to make imprints of equal strength in a flexible material when bored and away from a piano. Don't let one finger be much more powerful than the rest, as this can disrupt the flow of a piece by the apparent accent of that note the finger utilizes.

, The metronome often helps judge your rate of improvement.

Learn the musical scales on the piano.,
Familiarize yourself with the notes on the piano.,
Practice recognizing the individual notes.,
Choose a song that you'll be capable of learning.,
Identify a single note within the song.,
Identify the intervals, and thus the individual notes surrounding the note you've identified.,
Begin practicing the identified notes.,
Find the song's tempo.,
Play the song.",How to Learn Piano Songs by Ear," There are 8 notes in a scale (a,b,c,d,e,f,g,a), and it starts and ends on the same note.


If you can't or aren't willing to memorize the scales, then here's a whole/half step formula that is used in every scale. The notes follow this format in the whole/half step formula: whole step from Bb is C, whole step from C is D, half step from D is Eb, whole step from Eb is F, whole step from F is G, whole step from G is A, half step from A is Bb, and we’re back at the top.;
, Sit at the piano and play each note/key in a scale until you feel confident that you can identify each note.


Using tuning forks can be a great way to familiarize yourself with certain notes. There are many sites on the internet which play tones that mimic tuning forks.
Really, any instrument that you know to be in tune can be used to familiarize yourself with the sound of each note.

, Whether it means having someone play notes for you while you try to identify them, or using the wealth of internet games available for note and key training, practicing the ability to identify individual notes within a song is key to learning a song by ear.

, While this doesn't mean giving up on playing your favorite songs, it may mean finding one that's not quite as difficult as Beethoven's 5th Symphony.Try to find a slow song with a basic structure that doesn't have notes changing in quick succession.


Many pop songs have background piano music that can be easily imitated.
To check if it would sound good on the piano, check out some covers of it on YouTube or somewhere else on the Internet.

, This is your starting point for deciphering a song and further identifying other musical notes. You can look for the root note (the pitch upon which the notes are based) or you can use the first note, depending on which is easier to identify.


Generally, identifying and referencing the root note is a little more complicated than doing the same for the first note or any other single note in the song. As it tends to be an equilibrium for the other notes of the song, you must already have the ability to recognize that equilibrium.If you have a recording of the song, it's very easy to figure out notes using a piano or pitch pipe.
If you can't identify a note in the song, try finding a few of the song's notes through the internet. Once you've done this, you can move on and begin to identify others on your own.

, You can use intervals (the difference in pitch between each note) to identify notes based on the root note or the first note of the song - whichever is easiest to identify.


Don't be concerned about having to immediately figure out every single note from that one point on. Taking a break and analyzing that series of notes is the most effective way to learn the song.
Using Intervals is difficult for many people who are just beginning to identify notes by ear. So, make sure to familiarize yourself with the sounds of notes with Part 1, especially if your having trouble.

, Do it as many times as needed to get that particular piece of the song right. Knowing each piece well will help you learn the entire song more quickly.


Writing the identified notes on a sheet of paper can be a good way to record the notes.
You can simplify playing a song by playing only the part for your dominant hand. Once you've mastered the portion for your dominant hand, you can integrate your non-dominant hand into the song.

, This can be easily done by adjusting a metronome's beat to the rate at which each note is played.


If you don't have a metronome handy, you can tap your foot to keep time.
Try playing along with a recording of the song. This can help you make sure that the notes are correct and that you're playing at the correct tempo.
Clapping your hands for a minute or two to the tempo can be a great way to adjust your mind to the rate that the notes need to be played. , Identify the notes of another section of the song by repeating steps 2-4. After repeating steps 2-4 for each section of the song, string each section of the song together. Practice the entire song as one piece at the correct tempo. With practice, you can expect to be able to play the entire song fluidly.

Engage yourself in your music.,
Close the door if you can.,
Have fun playing the piano!",How to Focus While Playing the Piano," Get an idea of every piece or scale you might want to practice.

Always include scales, because they are the foundations of pretty much every piece of music. Regularly practicing them always helps you to improve your skills in playing piano.
Choice a song you like, which you are able to play. This boosts your confidence while playing and prompts your concentration during your practice section.;
, For example, you might need 20 mins to play your scales, or 10 mins to play your chosen song., You should always play the simple items, such as scales first, to warm up your fingers, and then play the more technically difficult pieces. Space your items according to:

Difficulty
Your interest in the item
Length
Importance

, This way, you will have clear goals of what to practice and thus stay focused on your piano section., Also, set a designated time each to practice piano.

For grade 3 and under, try at least 30 mins of practice each day.
For grade 5 to 6, try at least 60 mins.
For grade 7 to 8, try at least 75 mins.
For Certificate or above, try at least 90 mins.

, This helps you regain concentration and stay focused., If you have mastered a piece before your dedicated time frame, move on to the next item. The spared time can be used to play the piece you like most or you can compose something with that extra time. Having a reward always helps you to stay focus and encouraged to play the piano., For each day you have completed your goals, give yourself a reward. This could be anything: A bar of chocolate, some TV time -whatever you think will further encourage you to stay focused and stick to your plan., Don't have your phone lying around somewhere while practicing. That could seriously mess up your practice section., Picture yourself mastering what you're playing. Think of what your mates would say. Be grateful for your talent and keep practicing., You might be tempted to just walk out and give up on your playing. Isolating yourself from the outside world may help you stay focused., Once you have mastered what you have been practicing on, it feels great to see your fingers dancing on the keys without you even thinking about what you're doing. It also feels amazing to bring some symbols on a page come alive with your pure hard work and skills!"

Make an offer.",How to Find a Good Piano Teacher," Before you research possible teachers, consider your goals for playing and expectations for a good teacher. Are you a beginner who is interested in learning the basics? Do you want to refresh skills you learned earlier in life? Do you want to play at school or church, compete at recitals, or pursue a career in music? Asking these questions will make it easier to identify the best teacher for your needs., Are you the student or is your child? What kind of music do you want to learn how to play? Piano teachers often specialize in specific types of students and music. Thinking about the student's traits will also help you identify the right teacher.Consider the student's age. Are you the student or is your child? The way a piano teacher approaches a student who is a child is different than how they would engage an adult student.
Consider the student’s ability level. If you are a beginner, you might prefer someone who works with students of the same ability level. The teacher will likely know best how to avoid common frustrations beginners have and be less rigorous than a teacher who works with professionals. Likewise, a person who is looking to play for the public may want a teacher who is more disciplined and strict.
Consider music style. Are you interested in playing a specific type of music? Just as with the student’s age and ability level, many piano teachers specialize in certain types of music such as jazz, classical, or pop music. You can choose someone who teaches your specific style wish or someone who teaches different types of music., Think about the type of lessons you want to take. You might prefer private lessons in a home to a music school with group lessons. Identifying what format best suits your needs and comfort level will help you further narrow down your list of teachers.Consider group or private lessons. Private lessons are generally more expensive but have the benefit that you get more “one on one” time with the teacher to practice your skills. Group lessons tend to be less expensive and can be more fun for some students, though it may take longer to learn how to play the piano.
Consider the lesson location. Where do you want to take your lesson? Do you want to take it in the teacher’s home, a studio, or music school? Do you want the teacher to come to your home? If a teacher comes to your home, remember that you will need to own a piano before you can take a lesson.
Consider your schedule. How often do you want a lesson and are you willing to practice? Learning how to play the piano requires substantial time commitment to take lessons and practice. It also means spending a lot of time with a teacher as you refine your skills., Once you’ve established your goals and expectations, start looking for individual teachers who meet your needs. You’ll want to identify the names of several people to interview. This will ensure finding the best match for you.

, Word of mouth is one of the best resources for finding a good piano teacher. It can easily- and quickly- point you to a teacher


Friends and family may have recommendations from their own experience or from someone they know. Local elementary and secondary schools may know good teachers for children. Music departments at colleges and universities can recommend teachers for adult students.
Music and piano stores are another source of recommendations for good piano teachers., The websites of the Music Teacher's National Association (MTNA) and Piano Teacher’s Federation can point you to good, qualified, and certified piano teachers in your local area., Piano teachers sometimes have ads in the yellow pages of telephone books. The yellow pages can also point you to music and piano stores or music schools that can recommend a teacher.

, While you’re researching teachers in your local area who meet your requirements, make a list of several possible piano teachers who you can contact to interview.Having several options will allow you to hire a teacher that not only best meets your needs, but with whom you feel comfortable and inspired to learn.Write down the teacher's contact information as well as what considerations factored into your decision to put her name on your list. This will help you think of any questions you might have when you contact her.

, Once you’ve compiled the names of several possible teachers, contact each person. This will help you establish if there is any rapport with her, which contributes to a pleasurable and positive learning environment.


Call or email your potential teachers. If you feel comfortable speaking or writing to her , schedule a face-to-face interview. Interviewing candidates is an important step to establishing if the person will be the right fit for you or your child.
If a teacher doesn’t respond to a phone message or email within a week, contact her once more. Remember to leave her your contact information. If she doesn’t respond, move to other names on your list.

, The interview will let you know if the teacher is the right fit for your needs. It will give you the opportunity to ask plenty of questions about her qualifications and her work methods. It also gives the teacher a chance to consider if her instruction style is a good match to your needs.


Ask questions about topics such as the teacher's instruction style and materials, her certifications, if she varies her teaching routines and refreshes her own skills. Ask about the teacher's background in music and if she works in other areas of the music industry. Find out about payment and general policies including make up lessons.You may also ask for references from current or former students. They will often give you a good sense of the teacher’s instructional methods.Look for the qualities of a good teacher during the interview. These include: empathy, a positive attitude, patience, inspirational, and someone who recognizes and rewards accomplishments.It's very important that you and/or your child feel comfortable with the teacher, so trust your instincts. No one can learn in an environment in which they’re not comfortable., If you can see the teacher “in action,” it will give you a good idea of her style and whether her students are comfortable and happy with her instruction., Once you have interviewed a few teachers, compare your experiences with each of them.


Make a checklist of what you liked and didn’t like about each teacher.
Once you have an overview of your experiences with each teacher, you should easily be able to list of your top choices.

, Contact your top choice teacher first. If she doesn’t work out for any reason, you can continue down the list until you get the right person.


Contact the teacher and tell her you’d like to take lessons with her. Make sure to discuss your goals and expectations, and anything elements you want to talk about in greater detail like schedule or lesson format. Ask any lingering questions and allow the teacher to make inquiries as well.
Respect the teacher’s decision. The teacher may not be able to take you for any number of reasons including time constraints or she doesn’t feel her skills or teaching style can best serve you. If she cannot commit to teaching you, accept the decision and call the next teacher on your list. You could also ask her for additional teacher recommendations.
After you’ve found and hired the right teacher for your needs, you’re ready to start learning how to play the piano! Enjoy!

First define what is good teaching


Good teaching has a clear focus, with definite goals based on musical principles.,
Agree overall goals so that you can decide learning objectives


Discuss and agree individual goals with each student; not all students want the same outcome - some are ambitious, some play 'just for fun'.,
Know how to assess whether learning objectives are being achieved


We will know if we have succeeded in teaching the correct time value of dotted rhythms in a Kabalevsky piece, for example, if the student plays accurately now and remembers the timing in the next lesson.

,
Take into account your students' preferred learning styles


Different students have preferred learning styles and we should know what these are so that we can both teach that student most effectively.,
Be a creative teacher


Begin teaching a piece by focusing on an aspect of it that resonates with the individual student's preferred learning style, for instance exploring chord shapes with kinaesthetic learners.,
Get to know your students


Getting to know each student well enough to be attuned to their individual learning styles can be fascinating and rewarding, helping to make lessons more enjoyable and learning easier.,
Smile!,
Keep learning!",How to Improve Your Piano Teaching Success,"
It should aid current enjoyment, understanding and achievement and also promote future progression.
Good teaching uses teaching strategies that should be formulated according to conscious learning objectives for a particular student, whilst being sufficiently flexible to respond to the needs of the student in any particular lesson.;

A single lesson's objective may be to teach the student how best to practise legato pedalling for a Schumann piece but the long term goal might be to pass a Grade 5 examination in six months' time.

,, The most relevant preferred learning styles for the pianist are:
Kinaesthetic - these students will prefer to learn by 'finger memory' (the feel of melodic lines and chord shapes) and they will probably be good at this way of memorization
Visual - these students will prefer to learn by looking at the shapes that the music makes on the keys and they will probably be good sight readers
Aural - these students will prefer to learn by remembering how the music sounded. They may like to learn by rote more than by reading music and they will probably be good at memorising
Combination learners - these students will be able to draw on a range of learning styles.

,
Develop students' learning capacity in the ways that do not come to them so readily. If we know a student is probably going to learn pieces more by rote than by reading the notation, we should be positive about that student's memorising abilities, whilst also encouraging better music reading by regularly providing easier sight reading opportunities. Do this in fun ways, such as via duet playing and music games.

, Efficient learning maximizes every student's chance to fulfill his or her potential.

,


The most successful piano teachers are those whose students are happy with the teacher/student relationship.

,


Consider continuing lessons yourself or use the internet to explore new teaching pieces.

"
Try not to let frantic thoughts harbor in your mind, such as ""What if I forget the entire piece?,
Before your recital, eat two spoonfuls of honey.,
If your hands are cold, stay near a radiator beforehand to warm them up so you can play at your optimum.

,
Pretend that you are simply rehearsing and doing your best at it, and try to completely forget there is an audience.

,
Think to yourself, ""What would honestly happen if I mess up?""",How to Get Through a Piano Recital Calmly,""", or ""I'm going to make a huge mistake!"". You will have to do it anyway, worrying or not, so try to think only positive thoughts instead. Even if at first you find it hard to believe yourself, soon you will start to feel convinced by your own confident thoughts.;
, This works in your system in such a way as to make you more calm during and after recital. If your palms are sweaty before you play, keep some baby powder handy and nearby to sprinkle quickly on your hands before you go on. Sweaty hands majorly prohibit easy piano playing as your fingers will stick to the keys or slip.

,,, Truth is, no one will care. Just do your best and have fun with it!"

Search for a different teacher if you’re dissatisfied.",How to Find a Piano Teacher," Classical, jazz, and pop piano styles are all different. If you or your child wants to play a specific song, work by a specific artist, or a specific style, it is beneficial for you to find a teacher who offers the subject matter you or your child wants to learn.
, Is the goal for you or your child to become a concert pianist, or are you taking piano lessons for a hobby? A teacher who has focused on similar goals as yours can show you what it takes to achieve them.For example, if you or your child intends to be a concert pianist, look for a teacher who actively performs, as they ought to have connections to performance groups and performance opportunities.
If you or your child intend on applying to a music school, a teacher who has a degree from a music program understands what it takes to audition and can help you prepare.

, All styles have pros and cons, but the wrong one will, at worst, prevent you or your child from learning and ruin your motivation. Regardless of the method, most teachers will begin with basic finger placement and notes.

Some teachers start with music theory. This is meant to establish a foundation based in musical science or scores and works well for visual learners. Both children and adults may find this boring and unable to promote technical proficiency.
Other teachers adopt a tactile approach and encourage playing. The purpose is to capitalize on the positive feeling of evoking sound to encourage learning through motion. Evoking sound may be fun and convince you or your child to continue with lessons, but you may also miss out on written and auditory instruction.The Suzuki Method, which considers music a language, is an auditory style used especially on children. It involves listening to selected music, constantly repeating it, and group lessons. Critics say this can lead to poor sight-reading and lack of personal expression., If you think long enough, you’ll come away with a list of what you want out of a teacher. Some of these can prove helpful, but keep in mind that no teacher will fit neatly into a list of check marked boxes and too many expectations will hinder your search.

Characteristics such as age and gender will come to mind first. Unless you have a legitimate concern, be willing to compromise. For instance, a beginner may end up getting along better with an older teacher than a young one fresh out of school who has never taught a beginner.
Do refer back to your goals. If the intention is to apply to colleges, for instance, a teacher who has a degree can help the student prepare. If public performance is the goal, look for a teacher who has performing experience and connections to opportunities., Sometimes a teacher that seems ideal will require some driving. This has an effect on your budget and time commitment as well as your motivation, since you'll have to make the extra effort to transport yourself or your child to the lesson.

If you live in a rural or under serviced area, you may have to compromise and choose a teacher with different or less qualifications or multiple specialties beyond piano.
If you can find any in your area, home teachers are an option. You'll still have to be wary of their credentials and the convenience factor often means they charge more per lesson.

, How much money are you willing to pay for lessons? Price isn’t necessarily indicative of quality, but being asked for more than you can handle is a sure way to ruin your relationship with your teacher.

A teacher who charges more may not have as much to offer you as one that costs less, and going outside your budget won’t bolster your enjoyment of piano lessons.
Some teachers also offer half lessons at different rates, so consider this in deciding whether piano lessons fit into your schedule and budget.

, Lessons take time, but so does practice. Practice is an important part of learning. Every teacher will ask you to practice in order to solidify the lessons and improve your ability to play. A teacher who demands more time than you can give is one with which you’ll be at odds., Local word-of-mouth references are the easiest to collect. Chances are your friends, your church group, or others in the community have insight as to where you can find a quality teacher., Music departments are good places to find references. The teachers there often have strong ties to the community and local groups. Most will be more than willing to guide someone interested in music.When speaking to someone who teaches high school or lower or school band directors, ask them for community references. They'll know the area and have teachers to which they've referred their own students.
At a college music department, ask an educator or program administrator where they refer their students.

, These stores are gathering spots for teachers and students buying music-related materials. The employees are likely to have connections to the community and can help guide you in the right direction.

Describe what you’re looking for in a teacher and ask the employees or other guests if they know of anyone who can help you. For instance, ask, “Do you know where I can find someone who teaches jazz piano nearby?”
If the employees don’t know offhand, ask them if any teachers have left advertisements. Some locations have community boards or will hold onto advertisements for referrals.
Check and see if the store offers classes. Some stores can provide you with their own knowledgeable teachers.

, Many countries have organizations with databases that contain teacher information. Examples include the Music Teachers National Association, the Piano Teacher’s Federation, the Suzuki Association of the Americas, and Takelessons.com.

Check review sites such as Yelp. Schools and some teachers list themselves there. You can get a sense of the teacher from discussions and ratings by students.
Some teachers have their own websites and you can use this to gain information on their background and teaching experience. If they have recordings, listen to them to get a sense of their style.

, This may not always be possible, but it does give you a chance to gauge the atmosphere. Does it feel friendly and supportive? Compare this to what you or your child want to get out of this education.

This is a chance to speak to students and parents. Ply them for information about the teacher’s style, attitude, and their satisfaction with lessons.
You may have a chance to ask questions to the teacher. Keep in mind that they have a lot to take care of during these events, so they may be preoccupied and less than welcoming of the scrutiny. Give them another chance in a private session.

, Feel free to collect information from multiple teachers before making a decision, but inquiring gives you a chance to sit down and see how you or your child get along with the teacher on a personal level.

Inquire about the teaching methods used by this teacher. This will also provide an indicator of personality. Are they rigid in their methods? Can they explain how they provide insight to students?

, At the very least, it is a good idea to choose someone who is qualified to teach and knows how to play the piano. A wrong choice here can mean the difference between growth and either forgettable lessons or the start of bad playing habits.A part-time teacher with no proof of educational or performing credentials is troublesome unless you have no other options. Someone who teaches for extra money may not truly be proficient with the piano.
Teachers who claim to teach many instruments is also a warning sign. Someone who doesn’t focus exclusively on the piano may be spread too thin between students or have limited knowledge of the piano.For an additional check, ask to hear the teacher play. This is a way to judge whether or not they have a high level of ability, and both prospective children and adult students are bound to feel inspired from proficient playing.

, Children and adults have different learning styles. Many teachers do have a wide variety of clients, but not all are equipped to handle these different needs. A good teacher will be able to reach the student and tailor lessons to their strengths.Adults choose to learn piano and are physically, mentally, and emotionally developed. A teacher can be more straightforward in teaching complex concepts and yet still be respectful of an adult’s busy schedule.
Children benefit from a teacher who makes lessons feel fun. The teacher should be able to look the child in the eye, draw them out of their shell, and make them laugh.

, It’s important to know what policies the studio has. The studio should be well-run and regulated, ensuring that lessons go smoothly, but without compromising the air of patience and comfortability. If the student is a child, find out if the location is child-friendly.Some teachers will come to your home. Be wary of teachers that don’t have reason to be in your neighborhood, as their teaching and piano-playing credentials may be lacking.
Other traveling teachers may charge more per lesson, so if staying home is important factor that into your budget.

, Even if you believe you have found someone that would be a good teacher for you, the cost can still be an issue. If you can’t manage, half lessons may be available., The right teacher won’t overload you or your child with work, so it’ll help to know what the teacher expects out of a student. A teacher who is serious about making concert pianists, for instance, may push someone who is learning for personal satisfaction too hard.

You can ask, ""How fast do you expect me or my child to progress in each lesson?"" to find out whether the teacher demands a more serious pace or is comfortable slowing down for the student.
""For every lesson hour, how much time do you expect me or my child to practice at home?"" is an appropriate question to judge the teacher's expectation of practice.

, You may find an opportunity to engage a teacher for free, but most likely you’ll have to invest in an initial session. Consider this part of the interview process too, as you’ll get a hands-on chance to experience the teacher’s methods.You may ask if the teacher will allow you to sit in on a lesson given to another student. Although this would allow you to observe the teacher in action, most sessions are private and your presence would be disruptive.
If you have some piano experience, one possibility is to bring in music with which you are familiar. You may have the teacher play and observe their playing style, or you can play and familiarize yourself with their teaching style.

, It may take several lessons for student and teacher to feel on the same page, but consider the teacher’s enthusiasm and their approach to teaching. An effective teacher maintains passion in the piano by enabling you or your child to look forward to the next lesson.When the student gets along with the teacher, the learning process will be a positive experience. Interactions will feel natural and filled with insight. If this doesn’t occur, you or your child will lose enjoyment and struggle to learn, even if the teacher is a proficient player.
Parents should sit in on the early meetings. An effective teacher will listen to your child and allow them to have fun learning to play.After the lesson, consider how it went. Adults can judge for themselves, but a parent should ask the child how they felt, if they were comfortable or confused, and if they would like to see the teacher again.

, Disinterest from the student or the teacher is a sign of a bad fit. The lesson plan should be designed to challenge you or your child to improve, and the teacher should make an effort to set goals with you and encourage you to practice.Lessons should be tailored to the need of the student. They should never feel routine. If lessons become dull, it may show that the teacher doesn’t know how to engage the student or worse, shows a lack of respect towards the student.If the teacher routinely breaks commitments or kills the student's motivation, it is time to move on.

, Whether you or your child find the initial connection nonexistent or the lessons unfulfilling, don’t be afraid to make the change. Repeating the search process can be frustrating, but the right teacher means blossoming your love of the piano rather than squashing it."

Get a piano.,
Get it somewhere that you can take it apart.,
Look it all over.,
The objective is to have a good looking prop that you can move.,
Take off the top cover, the ""knee board"", and the front.,
Lift out all the keys (you may want to put them back in if you want the piano to look like a piano later).,
Take out any other obvious parts that keep you from getting close to the big ""harp"" in the back.

,
Do NOT unbolt the harp yet.,
Remove the rear sound board and harp by taking all the bolts out (about an hour) and sliding it up behind the keyboard frame/shelf.,
Take the harp to the junkyard.",How to Dismantle a Piano," Habitat for Humanity, Thrift Stores, want ads. All have pianos for free to several hundred dollars. Stick to the free ones. We went to Habitat and said we could take one of their three pianos away and wouldn't charge them. They smiled and asked if we wanted two. Their prices were $200, but they had been there six months.;
, My back porch is on a concrete slab, and I had a small tractor with a bucket to take it off the float. Remember, this thing is heavy! We had to put it on the trailer/float with Habitat's forklift. It usually takes four to six strong people to lift it a couple of feet.

, You can paint, patch, repair cosmetic things later. Don't tip it over. That comes much later. Note that it is several major parts/sections. 1) frame, cover, wheels. 2) keys and hammers. 3) sound/wire frame.

, It will not be a piano unless you put in an electric keyboard. More later.

, Pull out the pins of the hinges or the screws, release the clamps, or press the releases. You want to take these off neatly, because they will go back on.

, Release the hammer assembly. A couple of screws or bolts, and the entire thing should come out.

,, All those strings are really, really tight. First loosen or remove all the strings. All of them, and so loose that they start to sag. This is very important.

, Cut some notches out of the frame so it would slide out when the piano was on its back.

,


The Piano now weighs about 150 pounds and two people can manage it or slide it around.

Know what to expect.,
Ask your teacher how the test will be administered, and take time to check the syllabus.

,
Spend a lot of time in your lesson and on your own time preparing for the exam.

,
Understand what you're playing and listening to.

,
Practice scales.,
Do a practice exam beforehand with your teacher.

,
Do not leave aural and sight reading practice for the last two weeks.,
Practice everything correctly, because the way you practice it is the way you will play it.

,
Memorize the ledger lines and spaces of each clef and the notes they represent.,
If you get time for a short practice run, look quickly at the key signature and clefs, and then play the piece without stopping if you make a mistake.,
Do not try to show off by playing it quickly if you cannot do it.,
You will most likely be given two lines to sight read.,
Practice!,
Spend time just looking at the music and hearing its sound in your head.

,
If you're memorizing a piece, practice hands separately until they are comfortable, before playing with hands together.,
If you have the option in the exam, most people like to play the scales and arpeggios before the pieces, to limber their fingers up.

,
If the option is given to you in the exam, spend time deciding which order to play the pieces in.,
Quiz yourself on the key signatures of each scale.,
Practice the scales hands apart, together, with your eyes closed, one hand staccato and one hand legato: mix it up so that you know the scales inside out.,
In lower grade exams, you will probably be asked to clap to the beat, name the time signature, and distinguish differences between the same piece when played twice.,
If you are asked for the metre of the piece, think where you clapped for the strong beat.,
To work out whether the metre is simple or compound, think about each beat.,
Understand simple time signatures.,
Understand compound time signatures.,
Note that some time signatures can be used for either simple or compound time.,
Learn the terminology accurately.",How to Do Well on a Piano Exam," Ask your teacher what the exam contains. Most exams consist of playing pieces with or without music, playing scales and arpeggios, aural tests, general knowledge, and sight reading.;
,,,, Scales are a lot to memorize. Don't learn them in order; instead, mix them up a bit.

,, Ask your teacher to spend ten minutes at the end of each lesson practising this. You may be more worried about your pieces, but it is a good idea to start this as early as possible!


Sight reading is easy once you get the hang of it. Remember the key signatures and the beats in the 30 seconds the examiner gives, try out the piece both handed.
Aural is easy if you know your notes. They will ask you to say the notes, clap the rhythm, sing the piece and they will also ask you two features of a piece. To succeed in Aural, you need to learn the musical words.

,, Try to learn to play without looking at the keys.

,


Many examiners give you enough time to play the piece through, even if the time they set you is, for example, 30 seconds. To cheat a little, play the piece through twice without stopping. It is likely that they won't realise until you play it for the real time, and therefore you will have two rehearsals.

, The examiner is looking for quality of your playing.

, Firstly, look at the time signature and key signature. Then, get the beat in your head (count 1-and-2-and-3-and...). You can also tap with your foot if you want. Look over the lines and get a feel for what it might sound like. Then, slowly play the notes, perhaps saying the notes in your head as you play them. If you make a mistake, keep going.

, Keep playing your pieces every day. When you're practicing, try playing the pieces twice through without stopping each time you play them.

,, Your teacher should give you the pieces well ahead of time and will give you plenty of time to prepare. Keep practicing the pieces until they're in your head. While at school or work, tap out the song with your fingers on a desk or table. If you can tap right through without stopping or hesitating, you are probably all set. If you stop or forget what comes next, it usually means you still need to practice it. Once you have the notes down, add dynamics. Dynamics are usually easier, because once you have the feeling of the song, you can infer the dynamics.

,, Most people like to start with a technically demanding piece and end with their favourite.

, Chances are you will be given a list of scales for your exam beforehand, and the examiner will pick a couple at random for you to play.

,


One of the most important parts of playing a scale is to know which key your fourth finger goes on. If the fourth finger is on the correct key, everything else will fall into place.
It can sometimes help to say the fingering in your head as you play, for example thinking ""1-2-3-1-2-3-4-5"". Concentrate on the hand that requires most work, and the other hand usually falls naturally into place.
Fingering is also key for scales and arpeggios.

,


When clapping the beat, clap hard on a strong beat (the start of a bar), and more softly on a weak beat.

,


If you clapped ""strong-weak-weak"", it is in triple time. ""Strong-weak"" implies dual time, and ""strong-weak-weak-weak"" quadruple.

, If there were usually three shorter notes in each beat (or a multiple of three), it is compound time. If there were usually two or a multiple of two, it is simple time.

, These include 2/4, 3/4, 4/4, 5/4 and 3/8. The lower number signifies what each beat is (2 means a minim; 4 a crotchet; 8 a quaver and so on). The higher number is how many are in a bar (eg: 3/8 is three quavers).

, These include 6/8, 9/8, 12/8 and 12/16. Complex time signatures are mixtures of simple and compound time, such as 5/8 and 7/8. There are usually different ways to split up the beat. Complex time can also be fitted into more usual time signatures such as 4/4, for example by the main beats being two dotted crotchets, then a crotchet.

, For example, in simple 3/8 there are three beats of three quavers in a bar. In compound 3/8 there is one beat in a bar, which can be subdivided into three quavers.

, You might be asked a series of questions after the administrator plays a piece. Study the syllabus for your examination for details. Some questions might be, ""was the piece played piano fortissimo at the beginning?"", ""was the middle section staccato or legato?"", ""was there a ritardando at the end?"", ""was there a decrescendo at the end?"". Make sure you learn all the terminology for this.

To begin your piano tuner search, get recommendations from the following:

Universities and music schools/academies



 


Dealers that sell top quality pianos up to concert range.,
If you've got a local orchestra call them and find out who they use.,
Visit the websites of the piano tuners you are interested in using.,
When you get in touch with a tuner, ask them for references of previous customers or check for this information on the website.,
When you call to schedule a potential appointment, get them to spend a few moments telling a little about themselves regarding their experience and training.,
Ultimately, you might need to give a tuner a paid ""trial"" run.",How to Find a Qualified Piano Tuner," Ask for the concert piano tuner - their top technician.






Local churches that have a vibrant music program. Just a few minutes talking with the music director/organist should give an idea of how they look after the piano.





;
, Or call your nearest college/school and see who tunes all their pianos.


People who've actually had good experiences with tuners. In particular, a personal recommendation from a skilled pianist that owns a fine piano is a great help.






Your local music shop. Give them a call or visit them to ask them if they can recommend a good piano tuner. They may have someone they regularly recommend or have business cards of various tuners.






The piano teacher of your friends or those you know learning the piano






If you purchased your piano second-hand, ask the person you bought from who had been tuning the piano.






Piano tuner associations. Call and ask if your tuner is a member or alternatively, get names of members there. To become a part of an association/guild, a technician or tuner must pass a series of thorough examinations. If they need help passing these tests, they must take classes until the knowledge is obtained to pass. Therefore, you can be sure that a member of this association/guild has sufficient knowledge to get the job done properly.







, The sites may give you information on how long an individual tuner has been in business and his credentials. If the tuner does not have a website, call and ask these questions.

, If some of the tuner's customers are churches or schools, you can call for a reference. Remember a high price doesn't always mean high quality. Evaluate piano tuners to get the best tuner for the best price and don't forget that just because a tuner is expensive it doesn't make them a good or qualified technician.

, During this portion of the conversation try to get a feel for the way they feel about their job, their philosophy on customer service, etc.

, If you don't like what he or she does, move on in your search. Finally, tune the piano regularly to keep up the pitch.

Mix up a cleaning solution.,
Dip a soft white cloth into the cleaning solution.,
Clean the white keys.,
Clean the black keys with a separate white cloth.,
Wipe off any soap residue with a dry cloth.,
Remove fingerprints.,
Cover the keys to prevent dust buildup.",How to Clean Piano Keys1," Fill a bowl with warm water and add a drop or two of mild dish soap.








Alternatively, you can wipe a soft, damp cloth on a bar of mild soap.;
, Then thoroughly wring out the cloth.









It is very important to make sure the cloth is only damp, not wet. Otherwise water can seep down between the keys and cause damage to the piano body.Make sure you use a white cloth. A colored cloth can transfer dye to your keys and discolor them.

, Brush down the keys back to front. Do not wipe side to side, as this can transfer moisture and dirt between the keys. Do not wipe backwards either, since this pushes dirt behind the keys.







, This is important because if you use the same cloth and then wipe the white keys, black paint can stain your white keys. Use the same front to back motion that you used on the white keys.







, Again, make sure you wipe back to front to avoid getting anything between the keys.







, Wiping the keys down will remove dust and dirt, but fingerprints require different treatment.








Mix up a solution of 1 part vinegar and 4 parts water.
Dip a soft, white cloth into the solution. Wring it out to make sure it's only damp before wiping the keys down.
Wipe and dry each key individually. Make sure the previous key is dry before moving on to the next- the vinegar could damage the keys if it's on too long.
If your piano has a cover for the keys, leave it up for a day to let the vinegar smell dissipate.

, Be sure to lower the cover when you're done playing your piano. This way, you'll avoid dust buildup and won't have to do this cleaning procedure very often.

Know if your piano is an antique.,
Avoid using soaps or chemicals.,
Wear white gloves, preferably cotton.,
Dust the keys.,
Whiten the keys.",How to Clean Piano Keys2," If so, clean the keys with great caution. Although removing the yellowing will make your piano look better, it may destroy the piano's value.If you're unsure, consult an expert before treating the keys in any way.

, Ivory keys and plastic keys require different kinds of care. Ivory can absorb moisture and chemicals, which can discolor and damage it., While cleaning your ivory keys, you'll want to avoid getting oil or dirt from your hands on them. White gloves are best because colored gloves could transfer color to the keys., Use either a very soft-bristled paintbrush or a duster. Work back to front to avoid dust getting between the keys.








, There are a few methods you can use to whiten ivory keys.









Using a white vinyl eraser, gently rub the surface of the ivory. Do each key individually. When you're done, gently wipe away all the eraser bits using the same technique you used to dust the keys.
Use a #0000 (very fine) steel wool pad to wipe the keys and remove the yellowing. Make certain to use the very fine pads, or you could scratch up your keys.Expose the keys to sunlight. Sunlight can bleach the ivory and brighten the color. Leave your keys uncovered in a sunny spot and let them soak up the light. This may not whiten the keys as much as physically removing the yellow, but it will at least prevent further yellowing."

Listen to piano music.There is a vast amount of incredible music written specifically for the piano.,
Practice scales on the piano.,
Carry a notebook and handheld recorder wherever you go.You never know when you're going to hit a creative stride.,
Give yourself a break.,
Think about what you might like to write music about.Most music (even instrumental music) is directly inspired by something or someone.",How to Compose Music on Piano1," Even if the composition you're writing isn't ultimately meant to be heard on the piano, hearing other finished compositions when you're trying to get inspired can be just the thing you need.


Classical and jazz are the two most noteworthy styles of piano playing. Even if you're only going to be playing in one or the other (or a more contemporary style like pop) it's a good idea to give a listen to these different styles. Keep an ear out for the different chords the players use depending on the style.
Look into the work of Liszt, Chopin or Satie for great classically-based piano works.
For jazz, Bill Evans, Dave Brubeck and Chick Corea are all players worth looking into.;
, Whether you're starting out or an advanced player, warming up your fingers with scales can encourage creativity to flow more freely once you get into the thick of composing. If you know a few scales, try warming up with one you're not as familiar with. Hearing the distinctive tone of a scale might spark the first ideas of a fresh composition.


Scales are a very handy thing to know when it comes time to write melodies. While there's no sure method to write a great melody, knowing which scale you should be using will give you an idea of which notes to use and which to avoid.

, Unfortunately, a lot of the time, this happens to fall on the least convenient times where you're either far from an instrument or about to fall asleep. This is why it's a good idea to bring a notebook and/or sound recorder with you wherever you go. If you think of a great melody or rhythm, you can hum it into your mic and adapt it once you're by your piano again.


Most cellphones have a recorder option. If you don't have a cellphone for this purpose, basic handheld recorders tend to be very affordable.

, Creativity cannot be forced. If you're trying to break through the writer's block and nothing's working, it may be time to give yourself a break from things. Go do something that has nothing to do with the creative process. Clean your house. Talk to a friend on the phone. Pet a cat. Better yet, take a nap. When you return to it, you don't want to feel any of the frustration you were grappling with before. Creativity is best when you're feeling relaxed.


Going for a walk is a fantastic idea if you're getting frustrated. Many artists have some of their best creative epiphanies when they're out for a stroll.

, In some cases, the composer is driven by love and longing. Other times, he's trying to vent out bad emotions. Take a look at your life and single out some of the things that have most affected you in the past while. Have you gone through a break-up? Did you recently go on an unforgettable vacation? Anything that sparks feeling in you is fair game for musical inspiration.

Learn the major scales' notations.,
Adjust the bench.,
Sit properly at the piano.,
Correctly position your hand.,
Slowly play the scale.,
Use the correct fingering.,
Play with one hand at a time.,
Practice.,
Broaden your practice sessions to other scales.",How to Do Scale Exercises on the Piano," There are twelve major scales that you can practice, which will help strengthen the foundation of your piano skills. Becoming familiar with the scales' notations will help you be able to play them accurately. You can search them on the Internet and print them out to use as a reference as you play. A good scale to start with would be the C Major scale, which consists of the notes C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C.


Remember to not miss any sharps or flats. Although the C Major scale has neither sharps nor flats, other scales have them. An example would be the G Major scale, which contains the notes G, A, B, C, D, E, F#, G.

Keep in mind that a sharp is a semitone above and a flat is a semitone below.

;
, The height and distance from the piano should feel comfortable. When sitting on it, you should only take up about half of the seat. Position yourself so that you are close enough to reach the keys but not near enough that your elbows bend. Make sure that your feet can reach the pedals and press down on them when necessary.

, Developing a good posture helps you play naturally. Your body will be relaxed enough to avoid strain, and you'll be able to play for long periods of time without growing weary. When you play the piano, keep your back straight, and make sure your head is held high and facing forward. Your shoulders should be relaxed so that you can play naturally. You should also keep your arms and wrists lifted above the keys. Place your legs so that your knees are at a 90 to a 120-degree angle, and position your feet so that they are resting on or in front of the pedals.

, In order to play well, you should keep your hands arched and fingers curled on the keys, as if you're holding a baseball. This reduces the chances of cramping or weariness during your practice sessions. You should also keep a straight wrist as this prevents arthritis and carpal tunnel. In the beginning, you can tape a pencil to your wrist to keep it from bending. The goal is to move your fingers, not your wrist.


If your wrists are still bending, sit a little further away from the piano.
Keep your nails cut short. This stops them from clicking against the keys, and you'll be able to play better. You want your fingertips to touch the keys, not your nails.

, In order to make sure that you properly learn them, start to slow and gradually increase the speed. You will be able to hear each note better and give yourself time to memorize the scale. Playing quickly will only cause the scales to sound sloppy. If you want, you can invest in a metronome, which will teach you to keep the tempo. When you first begin, set the count to 85 beats per minute. Work your way up by increasing the speed.


You can set the count slower if you're having difficulties.

, There are specific orders to follow in scales. Using the correct fingering will help you play the scales in the most natural and effective manner possible. In the future, you'll also be able to play other songs with flowing movement. You can look up the fingerings of different scales online and print them out if necessary. When playing, be sure to bend your fingers at their joint and hold up your wrist.

, When you first learn the scales, practice them using one hand before moving onto the next. Then, you can play them together. If you notice that your right hand is better than your left, practice more often with your left hand to ensure that you sharpen its skills (and vice-versa). Make sure that you practice with both hands; otherwise, one might lose its skills, and you'll have to train it again.

, Repetition is key, as it helps drive the scale into your memory. Be sure to play until it sounds accurate, not sloppy. Do your best to connect all the notes for a smooth sound - never use staccato notes. As you become more familiar with the scale and keys, begin to look straight ahead as you play. You may be tempted to look down at your hands to make sure that you're hitting the right notes. However, the less you watch your fingers, the more secure you become in your playing.

, Once you become familiar with one scale, move onto others to continue expanding your skills. Some may take a longer time to learn, as they might contain more flats and sharps than others. However, continue persevering. Don't hesitate to ask for help or look up tutorials and advice on the Internet. Continue practicing old scales to ensure that you don't forget them.

Try to listen out for music playing in your head.,
Think of mental imagery while you play.,
Compose a springboard idea.Most compositions will start with a springboard idea, that is, the first part of the music written that all other pieces are based upon.,
Write follow-up ideas.,
Play around with volume and dynamic.Once you have some solid ideas, it's time to play around with them.,
Work some healthy repetition into your composition.At some point, it's necessary to put a structure to your ideas.,
Add vocals if you want.,
Get a friend's advice.,
Make revisions.A composition will start to come together more naturally once the first stages are through.",How to Compose Music on Piano2," Many composers report hearing music in their head when they sit down to compose, as if the piece they're working on is already complete and just needs to be written down for the sake of others. Creative intuition isn't the sort of thing that can be forced, and a lot of it will depend on the way you're feeling at the time. However, if you can pick up an interesting musical idea in your head, don't hesitate to run with it.


It's easy for our inner judge to get the best of us and censor ideas before we even try them out. When you're composing music, it's best if you drop this self-doubt. Even if you think something is a bad idea, there's a chance it may lead to something more promising when you start playing around with it.

, The experience of watching films has had a major impact on the way we associate music with visuals. In your mind's eye, try to picture a scene that would spark the same sort of emotions you'd hope to evoke in this composition. For instance, if you want a gentle, soothing composition, you might envision a quiet lake in springtime. Likewise, if you want something angry and dramatic, you might think of a warzone. From there, imagine what kind of music might score a visual shot like this.


This technique doesn't always work, but if you're a visual thinker, it's certainly worth trying out.

, This may be the most time-consuming part of your composition. It's all about latching onto the first part of your composition and running with it once you get it. Playing scales and experimenting with different chord shapes can turn this process into a sort of enjoyable play.

, If you play around on the piano and come up with a great idea, you should play that motif in your head and imagine what might come before or afterwards. Follow-up ideas should generally have the same tone and direction of your original idea. For the first while, focus on making ideas that work together. If you want a composition with surprising twists, you should only figure out that part of it once you have a firm structure in place.

, One of the great things a piano has going for it is its sensitivity to volume and dynamics. Making some parts louder and others quieter is a tool that beginning composers often tend to overlook. Dynamics can make a world of difference to the emotional effect of a piece of music.


Dynamics is defined as a show of change or difference within something. In the case of a musical performance, it refers to a player's treatment of volume. Some pianists play naturally louder than others, but a truly gifted performer will use quiets and lows to his advantage.

, As you piece your song together, some ideas will be more deserving of building the song around them. A typical composition will have at least one or two recurring motifs therein. While repetition is used to emphasize an idea, repeating too much will rob the music of its interest. If your composition has a lot of repetition in it already, you should try to gradually modify the idea somehow. Adding or switching a single note can change your audience's response towards an idea.


The idea of relying on repetition and slowly changing it over time is referred to as Minimalism.

, A piano functions beautifully on its own, but like a guitar, it can help if you add vocals on top of it. Vocals are a great match for the texture of a piano. Vocal melodies can copy from the melodic right hand of your piano parts, or you can write a totally fresh part to add to the arrangement. Although vocals are tricky to pull off successfully while you're playing piano, it gives you opportunities to add harmonies that wouldn't have been possible with two hands on a piano.



Lyrics are an obvious requirement in most cases if you want to add voice. Lyrics give you a chance to tell a more vivid story with your music. Of course, if you'd prefer it, you can sing without lyrics. Some compositions prefer to use the voice as another instrument, with ""oooohs"" and ""aaahs"" taking the place of lyrics.

, Once your composition starts coming together, there's a moment of truth when you finally show it to someone else. Play a rough run-through of your composition for a friend whose taste you respect. Once you've finished playing it, ask your friend what he or she thinks could be improved upon it. It's important to see this as a step in the creative process rather than a time for judgement; whether they like it or not doesn't matter until you've put the final seal of approval on it. Take what they say into consideration, and contrast it with your own feelings towards the work.

, Even if you like the version you've drafted, it's a good idea to run through the song and judge which parts of the composition could be improved, changed or removed altogether. Much like a good piece of writing requires editing before it's finished, a great composer will look at a piece carefully and do everything they can to refine it before calling it finished.

Decide upon a tonality.,
Explore chord progressions leading from the root chord.The piano keyboard has been explored to death.,
Develop melodies from a chosen scale.Scales are useful tools in the creation of melody.,
Experiment with tuning.Some avant-garde composers in the 20th century would open up the piano itself and change the tuning of the strings, but prior to the adoption of equal temperament for keyboard instruments in the 18th century, there were numerous tunings in use.,
Record your work via notation.",How to Compose Music on Piano3," A composition's tonality states the key and whether it is Major or Minor.At an early stage of composition, a key could be as simple as making an arbitrary choice, but it will have the biggest impact on the sound of your composition. If you finish your work later on and want to try it out in different keys, you should do so, but be forewarned that it takes a fair amount of work to transpose a composition note by note into another key.

, Every possible combination has been tried and studied at this point. With that, theory can suggest the most appropriate chords. The most famous of these is the I-IV-V-vi progression (the lower case denotes a Minor chord). The Roman numerals indicate how many keys above the root the given chord is. These four chords have been proven to go together very well.


Try using a chord map to get you started.Although this might sound too mathematical at the start, the truth is that it'll come without thinking to you once you get the basics of theory down pat.

, Although melodies need to be properly felt out in order to be memorable and effective, using a scale will narrow down the notes you're conventionally supposed to use.


Make sure the scale you're using is in accordance with the chords and key you've chosen.
The standard scale is a C Major scale. This scale is often used for vocal warm-ups before a performance.

, Changing all of the keys even a 16th of a step can result in a strange new experience of the piano. Be advised that messing around with a piano should only be done if you are an expert. Otherwise, you'll probably just end up sabotaging your piano for regular use.

, Notation is the technical language of music. If you're a serious composer, it's essential that you have at least some knowledge of notation and how to get your ideas down accurately on paper. Although it takes a little bit of time to get used to, there are fortunately lots of free online resources to help get you up to par with your notation reading and writing. If you're completely new to notation, you should try sight-reading a few basic songs on the piano until you're more used to it.


There are digital notation programs that may prove easier to work with than pen and paper.

Dampen a clean cloth.,
Apply a small amount of mild soap.,
Wipe the keys lightly.,
Dry the keys.",How to Clean Ivory Piano Keys1," To remove surface layer dirt and marks, use a clean soft cloth. Slightly dampen the cloth with warm water. Squeeze out any excess water before you use the cloth so it is not too wet.








Ivory piano keys should not be drenched in water as this can damage the ivory and cause the keys to swell, making them harder to play properly.
Do not use a brush or scouring pad on the keys. A soft clean cloth will work just fine.;
, Once the cloth is damp, apply a few dots of mild soap. Use soap that has no fragrance or harsh chemicals, as these can damage the keys.








Only use a very small amount of soap. You do not want the cloth to be drenched in soap or be lathered with soap.
If you do not want to use soap, you can skip this step. Often marks and fingerprints will come off the ivory easily with just a damp cloth.

, Wipe each key individually. This may take 20-30 minutes. Make sure you give each key a good wipe from top to bottom. Do not wipe them side to side, as this can end up damaging the keys. If you notice any stubborn marks, gentle wipe the area several times until the mark comes out.








If there are stains on the keys, you may need to use a stronger cleaning solution like rubbing alcohol, milk, or toothpaste to remove them.

, Once you have finished wiping each key, use a new clean cloth to dry the keys. Dry each key one at a time from top to bottom. Make sure there is no excess water sitting on the keys, as this can damage the ivory.

Possess some prior musical knowledge.,
Acquire a copy of the conductor's score for the piece you wish to ""piano-iffy"".,
Listen to a recording of the piece being performed to get a feel of which instruments have the melody, which have important lower parts, which have solos, etc.,
Transpose everything to concert pitch, which is the key of C (see related wikiHows for help).,
Figure out the melody parts.,
Write the bass part.,
Play through what you've written.,
After making those tweaks, play through it again.",How to Convert a Conductor's Score Into a Piano Piece," To do this, you'll have to have a pretty good working knowledge of melodies, how band arrangements work, and transposing.;
, If this isn't possible, you can try finding/making copies of individual parts to the song. At the very least, you'll probably want the first (and possibly second or third, if applicable) parts for the following instruments:


Trumpet
Clarinet
Alto sax (possibly Tenor and/or Bari as well)
Flute and/or Oboe (a piccolo part may also be helpful)
Tuba
Baritone/Euphonium and/or Trombone

, Make notes, if need be.

, Since the piano is a C instrument, having everything transposed before you start will eliminate a lot of confusion. You can also use this as an opportunity to put everything into some sort of music notation software (such as Finale Notepad), especially if you're working from individual parts instead of a score, so that it'll be lined up and easy to distinguish what's happening in every given measure.

, Using your new music format, look through it and see which instruments have the melody at any given time, and if there are more than one and they're all playing different notes (for instance, trumpets have a G, alto saxophones have an Eb, and clarinets have a C), write all the notes on top of each other.

, You'll especially want to watch the tuba and other low brass parts for this. Some of those instrument may have long notes, and some (tuba, especially) will probably have a rhythm-keeping set of quarter or eighth notes. Write in as much as your fingers and playing ability can handle.

, You'll probably notice at least one of two things: (1) You can't play it, and/or (2) there are some places that sound horrible. In the case of the first problem, try taking some of the chords and counter-melodies out. As for the second problem, it's often caused by balance issues. For instance, if you're playing a G (the trumpets' note), an Eb (the alto saxes' note) and a C (the clarinets' note), and it sounds awful, that might be because you're playing them all the same volume - there's only one of each key, and you can't really make adjustments to make it easier to hear the G, harder to hear the Eb, etc. Experiment to figure out which note is making the chord sound so bad, and try to find a way to take a note or tow out to improve the sound.

, Keep fixing problem spots until you have a playable, nice sounding piano rendition of your concert band piece.

Apply rubbing alcohol on the keys.,
Try non-colored toothpaste.,
Use milk to remove stains.",How to Clean Ivory Piano Keys2," Rubbing alcohol is a good option if you want to clean and disinfect the keys at the same time. Apply a small amount of rubbing alcohol on a clean soft cloth. Then, wipe down each key from top to bottom.








Once you have wiped all the keys, use another clean cloth to dry the keys. Make sure there is no excess rubbing alcohol or water on the keys, as this can damage them.

, Toothpaste can help to brighten ivory piano keys with stains or yellowing. Take a damp cloth and apply non-colored toothpaste to it. Then, rub each key from top to bottom.








Check that the toothpaste does not contain any coloring or dyes before you use it. You do not want to end up dying the white keys or making them more stained with the toothpaste.

, If you notice the keys are turning yellow or have stains on them, you can try using milk to clean them. Ivory is a type of dental bone so the fatty acids and calcium in the milk will clean and protect the ivory. Apply a small amount of milk on a damp cloth. Then, wipe down each key from top to bottom.








Never scrub the keys hard with any cleaning products, including milk. This can end up damaging the keys.

"
"
Try a bleach based cleaner.,
Use an ivory scraper.,
Hire a piano technician to clean the keys.",How to Clean Ivory Piano Keys3," To remove stubborn stains or yellowing, use a bleach based cleaner on the ivory keys. Always dilute the cleaner with water so it is not too strong. Using too much bleach on the ivory piano keys can crack or damage them. Check that the cleaner is safe to use on ivory before you apply it.








Apply the diluted cleaner on the keys with a clean cloth. Do each key at a time from top to bottom. Then, dry each key well with a new clean cloth, making sure there is no excess cleaner on the keys.

, An ivory scraper is a product designed to remove yellowing and stains on ivory piano keys. You can find this tool online or at piano supply stores. Speak to a professional piano technician before you use this tool to avoid damaging the keys.There is a risk that you will damage the ivory piano keys with the ivory scraper if you use it incorrectly. If you are not sure how to use the tool properly, reach out to a professional.

, If the keys are really yellow or badly stained, you may want to consider hiring a piano technician for the cleaning. The technician will remove each key and clean them individually with an ivory scraper or a professional cleaner. They will know the best and safest way to remove stains and yellowing on the ivory.Getting a thorough cleaning done on the keys once a year by a trained technician may be a good option, especially if you use the piano often.

Wash your hands well before playing the piano.,
Keep the piano out of direct sunlight.,
Avoid using aerosols or sprays around the piano.",How to Clean Ivory Piano Keys4," To keep the piano keys clean, always wash your hands well before playing the piano. If others are playing the piano, get them to wash their hands before they touch the keys.








You can also get in the habit of wiping the keys with a dry clean cloth after you done playing the piano. This can keep dust and dirt off the keys.

, Place the piano a shady spot in your home in room temperature and low humidity. Putting the piano in a sunny spot can end up causing the keys to swell up and lead to yellowing of the keys over time.If the piano is not used often and you want to protect the keys from damage, you can get a long key cover to go over the keys or put down the key cover on the piano. Keep the keys covered until the piano is to be played.

, Air fresheners, furniture polish, and other aerosol products can damage the ivory keys and cause them to yellow over time. Keep these products away from the piano and do not spray the keys with these products."

Understand the differences.,
Consider your needs.,
Think about the future.,
Don't forget about investment value.,
Make informed choices, regardless of which you choose.",How to Choose Between Digital or Acoustic Piano," Digital pianos are electronic devices that are designed to sound like an acoustic piano. They have no strings and no soundboard. Some have springs instead of hammers. Instead, they have electronic circuits and speakers. Here are some of the features which may make a digital piano an attractive alternative:


Different types of piano sounds, such as harpsichord, organ and more.
Instrument sounds such as strings, flute, and percussion.
Built-in rhythm capabilities to accompany playing.
The ability to record performances and interact with other electronic music (MIDI).
Never needs tuning.
Headphones are available for private practice.
Portability and low weight.
If you have a reasonably modern computer you can also run one or more 'software synthesizers', where your computer generates the sound and you use the digital piano as a silent master keyboard, which offers an attractive and relatively inexpensive ($100-$200) upgrade path for unconvincing sounding digital pianos.
;
, With some digital pianos, you can learn a piece by playing lit keys rather than reading music, which is useful for beginners and inexperienced piano enthusiasts. However, after the novelty wears off, you may want more from the instrument, and most digital pianos cannot offer it. A majority of electronic instruments lack the tone and touch of an acoustic piano, as well as the feel and the ability to convey subtle emotion and feeling. Remember that an acoustic piano has strings and hammers, while a digital piano has none. Having actual strings means that there are thousands of things in an acoustic piano (such as sympathetically vibrating strings) that are difficult to reproduce convincingly on a digital piano.

, Realize that beyond a certain level, some piano teachers will not teach students who have learned on anything other than an acoustic piano. Digital pianos are frequently counterproductive when it comes to technique and dynamic performance. These skills cannot be practiced on a cheap digital keyboard and later applied to a real piano.

, Consider that an acoustic piano will hold its value far better than a digital unit. An acoustic piano can last 100 years or more, while a digital piano may be obsolete in 5 years. An outdated keyboard is often difficult to sell. The technology has improved so much so now; the modern digital pianos by major manufactures, especially the companies making acoustic pianos, are making Graded Hammer action keys with natural weights and without a spring mechanism. These digital pianos really have the same action as an acoustic piano. Top digital pianos use the same wooden keys action, hence they are in fact better sounding than most upright acoustic pianos. Today we have digital pianos, for which the piano sound is sampled from top concert grand pianos with all 88-keys sampled at different velocity levels. Those pianos incorporate similar wooden keys and the same key length up to the balancing pins of a concert grand piano.

, It is often more difficult to choose a digital piano than an acoustic piano. Top priority should be given for the tone and the touch. So, a good quality digital piano cannot be purchased very cheaply, because to produce the proper piano action is a costly process for any manufacturer. Although digital pianos may not have a span as much as an acoustic piano, a good digital piano can work for easy 20 years or more.

Dust the keys.,
Clean ivory keys.,
Clean plastic keys.,
Clean the finish.,
Polish the finish only when necessary.,
Blow dust from the soundboard.,
Call a professional cleaner as an alternative.,
Wash your hands before you play.,
Protect the piano from the elements.,
Don’t place objects directly on the piano without protection.,
Close the lid when not in use.",How to Clean a Piano," Use a feather duster and apply light pressure to remove dust from the keys. Even dust can scratch the piano, so be very gentle. Be sure to get into all the nooks and crannies as well, such as between the keys.Dust the piano every couple days to prevent dust from settling on the piano and making its way into the soundboard and the action mechanism.;
, Find a clean white cloth made of a soft and lint-free material like flannel or microfiber. Wet the cloth with clean water, and then wring out as much of the water as possible. Clean a few keys at a time by gently rubbing them with the damp cloth in a back-to-front direction. Immediately go over those keys with a dry cloth to remove any excess water before cleaning more keys.Avoid coarse cloths, synthetic materials, and paper towels, all of which can scratch the keys. Don’t use colored materials, because they can transfer dye to the piano.
Don’t use a side-to-side motion when cleaning, because this can push dirt and moisture down between the keys.
To identify ivory keys, look for a grain that runs in the direction of the keys, fine splits, warped areas, and a matte finish., Because plastic keys are synthetic and not porous like ivory, you can clean them with extra cleaning products if necessary. Plastic keys will always be perfectly flat and smooth, and they won’t have a grain or warp marks like ivory ones. To clean plastic keys, you'll need a cloth damp with water and cleaning solution, a cloth damp with just water, and a dry cloth.


Fill a small bowl with clean water and a few drops of liquid dish detergent or vinegar.Mix the solution, then dip in a clean white flannel or microfiber cloth.
Wring out the excess water and gently rub a few keys using the back-to-front motion.
Take the cloth that’s damp with clean water and go over those keys to remove excess cleaning solution.
Go over the keys with the dry cloth. Repeat with a few more keys until all the keys are clean and dry.

, Gently rub the outside of the piano with a clean damp cloth,working in small sections, and then drying those small sections with a dry cloth. Use straight strokes in the direction of the wood grain, rather than circular motions. This will prevent swirl marks and streaks.Be sure to use a non-abrasive cloth, such as cotton or microfiber. This process will remove dust from the casework and remove dirt, smudges, and fingerprints.
Make sure the cloth is just slightly damp. You don’t actually want the damp cloth to leave behind any visible moisture.

, When polishing is necessary, apply a small amount of piano polish directly to a soft, lint-free cloth.Gently rub a small section of the piano in the direction of the grain. Be particularly delicate with corners and edges, where there's only a thin layer of finish. Then, wipe away any excess polish using a clean cloth.


It’s important that you use specific polish that’s safe for pianos, and only polish when the piano really needs a thorough cleaning, buffing, or has some fine scratches that need to be filled. Polishing can actually damage the finish on the piano, and if it gets inside, it can damage the action components.Don’t use a high-gloss polish if your piano has a lacquer finish, because lacquer finishes aren't meant to be high-gloss. Instead, use a product with a satin finish. Only use high-gloss polishes on polymer finishes.
Do not use regular household furniture polish, avoid silicone-based products, avoid products with lemon oil, and don’t spray aerosol products on or near the piano, because they can damage the exterior and interior of the piano.

, Whether you have a grand piano or an upright, you can clean out the soundboard by blowing away accumulated dust and dirt. To do this, either use a vacuum on reverse or a can of compressed air. However, it’s important that you only do this if you’re experienced with cleaning piano interiors, because it’s very easy to damage the strings and dampers. If you have doubts, call a professional to clean inside your piano. To clean inside yourself:


Hold the vacuum or compressed air nozzle a few inches (several centimeters) from the surface of the soundboard and use vertical strokes in the direction of the strings to blow out dust.Make sure that you don’t touch the strings or the dampers with the vacuum nozzle, the air can, or your fingers.
Blow the dust and dirt to an accessible corner of the piano, and then use a vacuum on suck mode to clean up the mess.

, A professional has the tools, experience, and knowledge necessary to clean the action parts of your piano without damaging the delicate and sensitive components.


Professional cleaners won’t just clean what they can see, and they’ll also remove the keys and other parts to get at dust and dirt in every nook and cranny., Dirty and oily hands and fingers are the major culprit that will make your piano dirty, so always wash and dry your hands well before you play.To wash your hands properly, wet them under running water and add soap. Lather your hands for at least 20 seconds, getting the fronts, backs, between the fingers, and under the nails. Rinse with running water, then pat dry with a clean towel., Sun, humidity, and extreme hot and cold can age, fade, and damage your piano. Keep the piano out of direct sunlight, and store it in a temperature and humidity controlled room.


Don’t keep the piano near any drafts or vents, and don’t store it in any room that’s prone to dampness., If you do have any objects on your piano, such as a lamp or metronome, make sure they have protective felt on the base that won’t scratch the surface.


Never place drinks, food, or liquids on top of the piano, and never let the piano come in contact with vinyl or rubber.

, Whenever the piano isn't being used, make sure the lid is covering the keys. This will protect them from the sun, dust, dirt, and spills."

Once your computer is shut down, make sure its power sources are disconnected. For example, if your desktop is plugged into an outlet, you will need to unplug it., If you are using a desktop computer you might have a keyboard that connects to the computer through a USB or PS/2 port. If this is the case, you will need to unplug the keyboard from the USB or PS/2 port prior to cleaning., Tilt the keyboard upside down. Use your hands to gently shake out any loose debris. You should not attempt to shake loose debris from a laptop keyboard. The shaking could potentially damage the computer., If you have a laptop computer, or if there is residual debris in a standard keyboard that cannot be removed by shaking, you should use a can of compressed air.

Wipes including Sani-Cloth Plus, Cavi-Wipes, and Clorox Disinfecting Wipes are safe for most computer keyboards and will remove bacteria as well as sticky substances.Make sure the wipes are not overly damp by squeezing out excess liquid before cleaning.
Opt for a disinfectant wipe that contains up to 0.5 percent hydrogen peroxide., Take a lint-free cloth and dab it in isopropyl rubbing alcohol. Gently rub the cloth over the keys. Pay special attention to any keys that are particularly sticky. These keys made need more than one pass of the cleaning cloth.Never pour alcohol directly on to the keyboard or keys!, Some areas of your keyboard will have more sticky buildup than others. These areas may need an extra scrubbing. High traffic keys like the space bar or enter key might require you to scrub a little more thoroughly than other keys., If you find that rubbing alcohol or a keyboard-friendly wipe aren’t removing tough debris, try a toothpick. Use the end of a toothpick to carefully dislodge debris and grim that is stuck to the keyboard., Once you have cleaned the sticky reside from your keyboard, you can polish the keys. Use a soft, dry lint-free cloth and gently swipe it over and around the keys. Your keyboard should now be clean, dry, and free of sticky substances!"

If you don't know about harmonic intervals, count the semitones, eg: A to Bb is one semitone, A to B is two semitones, D to G is five semitones.;
, For example, D has F# and C#. G just has F#. Ab has Bb, Eb, Ab, and Db. Also, make sure you know how to write the new key, and which order to add in the sharps and flats. (See Work Out Which Key You're In).

, Continuing with the same example, when you see a D, play a G. If you see an E, play an A, and so on.

, For example, if you see a C in the original music (which is actually a C#, but that isn't important right now), you're going to play an F, because that's a fourth higher than C. But you're in G now, which has an F# in the key signature. So you play an F# instead. In this example, both the original note and the new note are both sharped. This will not always be the case. A natural note may become sharp or flat or natural, depending on the new key. This won't matter if you have translated everything up or down the same number of semitones.

, For example, if your original song (in D) has a Bb, that's a half-step down from its normal pitch (n to b = -1). The note B in the old key corresponds to the note E in the new key. In the new key (G) E is normally natural, so you must drop it a half-step, to Eb.

, You're transposing it to E, which has F#, C#, G#, and D#. You see a D# in the written score. You say to yourself, "" D is normally flatted in this key, but here it's sharpened. That means it's been raised two semitones, or one tone. D in the old key corresponds to A in the new key. A minor doesn't have any sharps or flats associated with it, so to raise it a whole-step up from A natural, play Ax, which is equivalent to B."" Don't worry; it's not usually going to be this difficult in real life.

, For example, if the original music goes from C to D (a modulation of one tone), and you're transposing such that it starts in Eb, the music after the key change must be in a key a tone higher than Eb, which is of course F.

Try practicing about an hour a day, or half an hour if you have a busy schedule or can't find time.,
Do extra practice whenever you have more time.,
Listen to the song or piano piece you are playing.,
Try not to look at the dynamics in a piece, as rules you cannot break.,
Practice sight-reading and don't worry about making mistakes.,
Pay close attention to your mistakes.,
Count as you play during practice according to the time signature.,
Play in front of friends and family.,
Ask someone to play the piece you are practicing for you.,
Concentrate on playing the piece properly.",How to Become a Better Piano Player,";
, For example, on weekends you could do more than an hour, like two or three, or even more. This is very helpful because it pulls you out of the routine of piano playing, and lets you practice more and perfect the pieces you play.

, For example, if you are taking piano lessons and are about to play a new piece, you could try searching on the internet for videos or songs and hear how it sounds. This can be very helpful because it teaches you how a song is played and lets you recognize the 'emotion,' the piece is giving off.

, For example, if the piece starts with an 'mp' (mezzo-piano) it only means 'moderately soft' these dynamics don't have specific volume levels. If you are practicing, you don't need to play accordingly and then have a difficulty hearing yourself, you should only play as it tells you when you are actually trying to play it properly.

, This can be very helpful, because it's almost like scanning a paragraph and looking at the picture. It helps you to understand what the passage is trying to convey before you actually read it and lets you know what comes next. This is the same with music, and it can help you stop making mistakes.

, Don't look at them as a burden, but instead as a pat on the arm informing you of avoiding that the next time.

, For example, if the time signature is 3/4, then count the notes in each bar as you play. This can be helpful because it helps you judge how quickly or slowly a note should be played, but you don't need to count in the piece after you have played it well.

, This can be challenging at first, as some people are shy or lack confidence. But this helps with your playing, and you will become more confident about playing in front of people.

, For example, a much more advanced pianist or a piano teacher can be a lot of help. When they play something, it makes you understand how the piece should be played, therefore helping you play it better.

, Many people feel that they are excellent when they're playing the piano alone but not nearly as good when playing in front of others. Try not to play too fast or too slow to impress people, even if no one's there. Maintaining a more comfortable tempo helps you concentrate on not making mistakes. When you have become comfortable with the piece at that tempo, you can speed up or slow down depending on the piece.

Make sure you want a piano and not a digital keyboard.,
Figure out what size and sound you want in a piano.,
Consider who will use the piano.,
Choose the finish you want.,
Research the different brands of pianos.,
Determine a budget.",How to Choose a Piano1," Nothing quite beats the sound of an authentic piano, but many digital keyboards can replicate the sound of a piano, as well as mimic other instruments. They are also lighter and cheaper., Size matters when it comes to pianos. The bigger the piano the better it will sound. You hit a key on the piano. It triggers a mallet that strikes a chord in the piano. A bigger piano means that there is more room for the chord to vibrate. More vibration equals richer tone.


Consider the amount of space you have. There are two kinds of pianos — upright and grand. Uprights save more space than grand pianos. You might not have room for a grand concert piano at home. Uprights come in different sizes and can range from 35” all the way up to 52” tall. Grand pianos are not as tall as uprights, measuring around 36"" to 48"" tall and up to Fazaioli's 10' model.Consider how often you move, when determining the size of your piano. Remember that when you move, you’ll have to move the piano too. This can get expensive., Are you or your children classically trained? Or are you a novice? Some people buy beginner pianos and then upgrade later on. This is a safe bet, because many people lose interest in playing the piano over time.


If you decide to buy a beginner piano, purchase an upright piano. They are cheaper. They sound great. They save space. In general, they are ideal for people just starting out.

, Do you want a wood grain finish or a painted exterior? Figure out which finish you like and how dark or light you want your piano to be. Most people only consider the piano, its size, and its sound quality. They often forget to think about how the piano will look with their other furniture.

, Every piano company is different. Some feature more contemporary designs, while others retain classical flourishes. Look at examples of each piano design on the manufacturers' websites. This is a good way to get a feel for the prices of most pianos.

, Upright pianos cost between $5,000 and $15,000 on average. Grand pianos normally cost anywhere from $10,000 to $50,000. Of course, these are average prices. You can find pianos at wildly different ends of the price spectrum. Pianos can be pricey to purchase and they also have additional maintenance fees like tuning costs. Expect to tune your piano at least once per year. This can cost between $100 and $350 depending on where you live.


Set aside an allowance of $250 to $1000 for initial repairs and transportation.
Consider the climate you live in, and set aside money for keeping your piano in good condition. Pianos are generally made of wood and wire, both of which expand and contract slightly with temperature changes. Climate can affect the frequency of tunings.
Unlike other big purchases , pianos depreciate in value very little over time if kept in good, working condition. Buying a piano might be a good investment. "
"
Visit piano dealers in your area.,
Find an expert to help.,
Buy from a reputable piano dealer.,
Don’t let the salesperson bully you into a more expensive purchase.,
Contact a reputable piano restoration company and ask them to complete an inspection of the instrument before you buy it.",How to Choose a Piano2," Be sure to find out whether or not they are registered dealers. You can simply call and ask to find out. Look for deals. Like car lots and department stores, piano dealers have sales and coupons too.


Ask about warranties. A good piano manufacturer will stand by their product and will offer a warranty. Warranties can help offset the costs for repairs., If you're just beginning your piano shopping experience, bring someone with you who can help you choose a piano with quality sound.


This is the ideal situation. They will be able to examine the quality of the piano. They can play them to make sure they are in working order. They can also make recommendations on the spot about types of pianos and the materials used in pianos.

, Doing so ensures both your peace of mind. Bottom line: Find a dealer you trust and who knows their products. You could be buying from someone with little or no in-depth understanding of pianos.


You may not be able to tell if a dealer is trustworthy, but you can ask questions to help avoid scams. Always ask:
How long have you owned your business?
What is your warranty policy?
Can you provide me with any testimonials?
Do you have your own repair shop?
What is your purchase and return policy?

, Sales associates take a commission of their sales. Remember that pianos are huge investments and take up a lot of space. Don’t burden yourself in either department.

,


When you buy a new or used car, it is always a good idea to get a knowledgeable mechanic to inspect it. Pianos are no different. Sometimes, a specialist will recognize a problem that the salesperson failed to mention and you completely missed.

Know why you need a piano.,
Nail down your budget.,
Decide where the piano will go.,
Know your brands.",How to Buy a Used Piano1," Are you a recent conservatory graduate seeking to pursue music professionally? You probably have favorite brands and features, so focus on the preferences you have. Are you simply looking for an instrument for your elementary-age children to practice on? You will probably have more flexibility, but will still want to focus on quality and durability. Buying a piano is a commitment, and no matter who you are, the instrument you purchase should be in good condition and in tune.


Think about if you’re settled in your current dwelling. It’s best to buy a piano if you don’t plan to move for a while, since they’re tricky to transport.;
, Buying a used piano is usually cheaper than buying a new one, but it’s still more expensive than a harmonica. Furthermore, there are hidden costs in acquiring a piano that need to be considered.


Expect to spend a minimum of $2000 on a well-made used piano.How will you get the piano home? You probably can’t strap it to the roof of your car, and most movers don’t specialize in transporting pianos. Your best bet is to book a trained piano mover, which can cost as much as a few hundred dollars.Consider the other professional help you’ll need. In some cases, you may seek the input of a Registered Piano Technician (RPT) before you buy, and in others, you may need to make an appointment with a piano tuner to get the instrument in ideal condition before you play it.

, You probably already know if you’re looking for a grand or a modest upright piano, but use a measuring tape and make sure you have plenty of space for it. While you’re at it, measure your doorways and stairwells (if applicable). It’s no use finding a perfect piano if you can’t get it into your home.


An average upright piano is 60 inches long, 44 inches tall, and 24 to 30 inches deep.A baby grand is around 5 feet in width and depth.Remember to leave extra room for your preferred seating.

, You might already have a good handle on which piano brands you like and don’t like. A brand’s quality can vary a bit from model to model, but a well-known brand’s name on the piano is generally an encouraging sign.


You can generally rely on Yamaha, Kawaii, and Pearl River for solid budget pianos.If you want to get really fancy, look into Steinway & Sons or Bösendorfer pianos."
"
Find a Registered Piano Technician.,
Visit a piano store.,
Be wary of private sellers.,
Ascertain the piano’s age.,
Inspect the piano.,
Make sure it’s in tune.,
Ask plenty of questions.,
Move the piano with a trained piano mover.",How to Buy a Used Piano2," If you don’t quite trust yourself to check everything, the input of a piano technician can soothe your mind. A piano can look like it is in good condition, but require more repairs than it’s worth. For example, replacement of the pin block that holds the pins at the correct tension can cost thousands of dollars. A good way to find a technician is through either your local store, tuner, or from the Piano Technicians Guild.Ask your technician to accompany you to a sale or store. Say ""I'm hoping to go to Alison's Piano World next week to pick out an upright piano. Are you free to come with me to advise?""
You can also ask your technician if they’ll tell you about a piano based on pictures that you text them. Say ""If I can show you photos of a baby grand from Alison's, will you be able to tell if it's in good shape?"" If they say yes, ask ""What parts of the piano should I focus my pictures on?""

, This will give you a good perspective and plenty of options. Piano stores generally have used pianos that they have taken on trade or consigned from people in your area. They’ve usually checked and tuned the pianos for you, and they may have technicians and tuners on hand to help you purchase.


If you haven’t visited the store before, read up on online reviews first.
A good store will let you take time to inspect the piano, and won’t rush you to make a sale.

, These are tricky. You might be able to find a good deal on Craigslist or another public forum, but the pianos sold by regular people probably haven’t been through all the stringent vetting that a piano in a good piano store has.If you’ve got your heart set on a particular piano, check if it’s a reputable brand, and bring an RPT with you.

, So you’ve found a piano you think you might like! The first and easiest way to learn about it is to check its age. Find the serial number by looking between the bass and tenor strings (on a full size) or beneath the lid (on an upright). Then, feed it into a Piano Age Calculator like this one.Ideally, it should be under 30 or so.

, Take a deeper dive into the piano you like, and carefully examine all the parts. It’s best to have an RPT to help you do this, but you can certainly do it by yourself. In general, think smooth. The piano should be even in texture, movement, and sound.


First, look at the piano’s case. Does it have a musty smell or termite holes? Avoid it. Is the finish cracked? It might’ve been standing near a window, and the atmosphere that damaged the finish probably also damaged the tone.Next, look at the keyboard. You want keys that make a straight line (or curve slightly up in the middle), move easily, and sound fairly consistent in tone. Play each key. Do you hear any rattles or wobbles? If not, that’s a good sign.Now, open the lid. Check if the hammers are worn and the strings are evenly spaced. All fabrics (like the felt and strings) should look fresh, not frayed.Get down on the floor and check the pedals and bridges. The pedals should move easily, not loosely. There should be absolutely no cracks in the bridges., How can you tell if you like the way the piano sounds if it does not sound the way it should? If the piano is not in tune, it probably means the owner or store has not provided any maintenance to the piano, which is a red flag.A piano store should have a tuning fork so you can check. You can also use a tuning app on your smartphone.

, Whether you’re buying from a store or a private sale, ask as many questions as you want to. A piano is a big purchase, and a reliable seller will be more than happy to answer some of your queries. Here are some important ones:How old is this piano?
Do you know what maintenance has been done on it?
Who plays or played it? (Students, kids, family…)

, As you’ve learned from your research and examinations, a piano is a beautiful and complex instrument! Therefore, it’s best to find a mover who has been specifically trained in pianos to transport it for you. You can check your phone book or local online listings, or ask the store if they have any recommendations."

Run an internet search of your ""city's name"" plus ""piano store"".,
Call around to a couple of stores and ask if they carry digital pianos.,
Check the length of the white keys.,
Check how far you can depress the key.,
Notice where the sound is emanating from.,
Test the polyphony of the piano.,
Listen to the sound quality of the digital piano.,
Go for it!",How to Buy a Digital Piano," (ex: Richmond piano store) Before buying a digital piano it is important to try it out in person.;
, Normally the sales people are quite helpful. If they don't carry digital pianos, they will know a piano store that does.

, They should be the length of a dollar bill minus one of the white margins. This is the standardized size of a grand piano key.

, The standard depression for acoustic pianos is 7/8ths of an inch.

, Is it from speakers behind the digital piano or only from the area of the keys you are playing? Higher quality digital pianos will have speakers behind each key from which the sound will come. You can easily check by playing a chromatic scale for several octaves.

, Polyphony is basically the memory the piano has and how many notes the digital piano will play at once. If you are playing sustained arpeggios you don't want your earlier notes to fade out prematurely.

, Some may sound quite electric while others mimic the sound of a grand piano. Don't be afraid to ask the sales person what acoustic piano was recorded for the sound of the digital piano.

, Purchase the digital piano that best fits your price range and has the most realistic features.

Practice!,
Prepare for a piece or scale before you take it.,
Learn how the pieces should sound.,
After learning to play the piece, try playing along with these videos.,
Ask your teacher for tips on better playing.,
Try not to repeat your mistakes.,
Play your prepared piece in front of another pianist.,
Don't run away from the time signature.",How to Be Excellent in Piano Lessons," Being excellent in piano lessons, stems from being an excellent pianist in general. Practice your scales and pieces well, and make sure you know them.;
, For example, if your piano teacher says that you will take a new piece next week, then work on playing it until you know it perfectly, this will make the lessons smoother, and you can focus on working on your mistakes rather than practicing the piece. It's almost like preparing for a lesson at school beforehand: Scan, read, underline, make notes, and learn from mistakes.

, Search for the piece on the Internet by watching videos of people playing, or songs to listen to and download.

, After you have listened to the piece, play along with it after you have experimented with the keys and have learnt to play properly and according to the time signature.

, This is not meant to be in general, practice is the main key. But perhaps your teacher could give you tips concerning you in particular, or things that you could work on.

, Complications in fingering, confusion of the time signature, a bad habit that's hard to get out of, are all things that tend to happen more than once. Work on solving these before they become a real dilemma!

, More importantly someone who is more advanced, or who can at least play the piece more fluently than you can. They can point out mistakes before your next piano session.

, If you are preparing a piece to be excellent in your lesson, then you don't have to play it fast when you're on your own! Your piano teacher won't expect you to play excellently from the first time, so you shouldn't show off and try to impress - this can have an opposite effect!

Develop a lesson plan for each student.,
Start with the basics.,
Focus on problem areas.,
Make lessons fun.,
Provide honest criticism.,
Encourage practicing.",How to Be a Good Piano Teacher1," A major pitfall for some new piano teachers is focusing too much on the lesson plan, at the expense of the student. Students learn at different paces, and have different strengths and weaknesses. Tailor your teaching to each student's needs. Keep an open dialogue about the student's musical tastes, and how he feels about the pieces and exercises you've assigned.;
, If you're new to piano teaching, you may spend more time than you expect on finger position, middle C, and other basic concepts. This is especially true if you are teaching young children.


Try letter notation to introduce students to reading music. Move on to regular staff notation once the student is ready.
Even some intermediate students may not have the type of training you expect. Do not assume they can read music or identify key signatures.

, Take notes on where your student struggles, then adjust his lessons and homework to focus on those areas. During a lesson, have him play a song once through, then guide him through repetitions of the sections he had trouble with.


Don't overdo it with difficult assignments, especially if the student is not devoted to the piano. Keep the student motivated by including pieces that he excels at or particularly loves.

, Use games, repetition, and mnemonics to help students engage with the lesson. Try inciting student to want to excel, by introducing them to things like some of Liszt's Transcendental Etudes. Find a balance of fun and focus that works with your teaching style. This is especially important for children, who often learn best in a relaxed, but not distracting, atmosphere.

Young kids often respond well to reward systems. Try putting up a sticker chart and offering a prize when the student fills it with stickers.
A big part of this is giving students some choice over which pieces to play, or the chance to explore a style of music that appeals to them.

, The best way to help a student improve is to hold her to a high standard. If you aren't strict about technique, the student may develop bad piano habits. This is especially true for advanced students who are serious about improving, but even a young beginner needs a teacher who can hold them to basic standards.

Criticism does not mean negativity. Acting exasperated, angry, or condescending will demotivate your students.

, Many students are reluctant to practice, being more interested in sports or being with their friends instead, which can make all your work together nearly useless. Keep an eye out for students who don't (or won't) practice, and talk to them (and if necessary, their parents) about ways to motivate them. If the student doesn't want to learn, the lessons will not lead anywhere.

Keep up your own piano skills.,
Cultivate patience.,
Join music teacher associations.,
Invest in professional development.",How to Be a Good Piano Teacher2," You do not need to be a virtuoso, but you cannot afford to cut corners either. Excellent sight-reading ability, knowledge of music theory, and good technique are all requirements for teaching piano., As a piano expert, you know how difficult it can be to learn an instrument. You will need large reserves of patience to draw on, especially for difficult or unmotivated students. Do not let frustrating moments trigger unnecessary negativity.

, Look for organizations on the local, state, or national level related to music teaching. Join these so you can share knowledge with your colleagues, and so you can pass on recital, audition, and competition opportunities to your students.

, If you already have teaching experience, you know that you need more than piano skills to be a good teacher. If you haven't already, consider earning a continuing education certificate or a similar qualification in music teaching.


Even if you are not able to enroll in a full course, spend time reviewing different lesson sets, reading books on pedagogy, and trading tips with other music teachers.

There are many just a Google search away.;
, There are number of books specifically designed to teach sight reading, and take you through practice exercises methodically—each exercise building on the previous exercise, and adding a little something new each time. Here are couple highly-recommended titles:



Improve your Sight-Reading! Piano, Level 1 from Alfred Music Publishing. There are a total of eight volumes, which take you from beginner to advanced.

Primer Level Sightreading Book from Hal Leonard Publishing. For more advanced readers, there are two additional volumes.

, The biggest key to successful sight reading is that you only read and play the music once. You can buy a number of music books, borrow them from the library, or print out piano music from a website. Those will all work, but may result in a haphazard learning process.


Think of it like this: when you learned to read, you started with ""See Spot run. Run, Spot, run!"" You didn't immediately jump to ""O joy, O new vertigo of difference, O my platonic reader-writer racked by a most platonic insomnia...""For the best results, focus on music within your skill range.

Look at the black colored keys of the keyboard.,
Find the group of five black keys right in the middle of the keyboard (or at least, the group that is almost in the middle for smaller keyboards).,
Find the group of two black keys in the group you located in the previous step.

,
Middle-C will be the white key immediately below (to the left of) the first black key of the two keys you found in the previous step.

",How to Play Middle C on the Piano1," You'll find they're organized in groups of twos and threes. That is, two black keys with one white key in between them, then, going right, two adjacent white keys, then three black keys with one white key between each one and the next, then again, two adjacent white keys, and the pattern repeats again.;
,


The five keys must be ordered as two keys group then three keys group, not the other way around.

,,"
"
Sit at the piano or keyboard with your music in front of you.,
Make note of the details.,
Play the piece.,
Keep practicing in this manner as often as you can.",How to Practice Sight Reading Piano Music2," Make sure your posture is good, and the music is positioned so that it's not a strain to read it. Take a look at the notes and rhythms, and try to understand the piece a little bit before actually playing any part of it.


At the very beginning stages, it's helpful to practice the rhythm before you add in the melody. Tap your foot, or use a metronome, and clap out the rhythmic values. Maintain good sight-reading discipline, and don't stop if you make a mistake.
You should be able to internalize rhythmic reading relatively quickly. Once you are beyond the very basic stages, it's better to integrate both rhythm and melody at the same time.

, Look at the key signature, any changes of clefs, and the dynamics of the piece. If you can, look for chords, and determine what they are.


Look for the trickiest part of the piece, for example, sixteenth notes (semi-quavers), or a place with a lot of accidentals that are difficult to digest, and determine a speed at which you think you can play even the trickiest parts. It is very important to not stop and restart when you make a mistake.—Just keep playing.
Look for patterns while you are playing, and always try to read a minimum of one measure ahead.

, After reading through the exercise, it's time to make some noise. Count out the tempo aloud, and make sure you are counting slow enough so that you can realistically play all the notes.


You may miss a couple of notes, but it's more important that you keep your tempo accurate.

, Feel free to go back and study the pieces you played in more depth. The more you practice, the better your sight reading skills will become.

Find out the number of keys you keyboard has in total (counting both black and white keys).,
According to the number of keys in your piano, count the following number of white keys going from the left-most side of the piano in the right direction:


88 Keys: 23 keys (Middle-C is the 24th white key)

You can also find the group of five black keys easier as the fourth group of 5 black keys, then use the method above.",How to Play Middle C on the Piano2,"

Usually, manufacturers create keyboards with standard keys count starting at 88 keys (the grand piano has 88 keys), 76 keys, 61 keys, 49 keys, 24 keys and finally, sometimes even 12 keys

,



76 Keys: 19 keys (Middle-C is the 20th white key)

The third group of 5 black keys (there usually is a group of three black keys at the left side at first, don't count those)



61 Keys: 14 keys (Middle-C is the 15th white key)

The third group of five black keys.



49 Keys: 14 keys (Middle-C is the 15th white key)

The third group of five black keys.

Pianos vary widely in style, size, and cost; for most people, a medium-sized upright piano is ideal, as it takes up less space than a grand piano and has much better sound than the most compact styles. Bear in mind that although it's possible to find pianos for cheap and sometimes even for free, it is dangerous and difficult to move a piano from place to place. Be sure you have a professional delivery service lined up to help you move your instrument. Keep in mind that after you move the piano it will take a couple hours or a day for the strings to acclimate so avoid playing it for a while.


When you acquire a used piano for little or no money off the private market, it's likely that you'll need to get it tuned and possibly even repaired before it will be usable. Check your local business listings to find someone who's willing to make a house call and assess your piano's condition.
It's acceptable to purchase a high-quality electronic keyboard if you must (for example, if you live in a tiny studio apartment), but it isn't recommended. You'll have more trouble learning proper posture and hand positioning than you would with an actual piano, and you'll never be able to exert as much control over the sound of a keyboard as you can with a decent piano. There are some electric pianos, though, that have their keys weighted to feel like a real piano. This would be ideal but it may be just as expensive as getting a real piano. If you're dead set on an electric one for whatever reason this is the way to go.;
, Once your piano is set in place and has been tuned and examined by a professional, it's time to get a bench or stool (which are adjustable but lack the storage space found with many benches) and some music to play. Many pianos come with a bench; otherwise, they can be found at thrift stores and music stores. Try to get an adjustable bench, as bench height is very important to ensuring proper posture. Don't use a dining room chair or an ottoman as a substitute unless it naturally places you at the ideal height for playing.


Ask your local music store for recommendations on basic, easy-to-play music books. It's likely the clerk will know of at least a couple of books you can use. Try to get one book that encapsulates beginner advice in the front and contains scales and arpeggios, and one book with simple, complete songs to practice, such as old folk songs.
If you have trouble keeping a rhythm, buy a metronome. A metronome sits either atop your piano or just beside it and ticks like a loud clock at a pace you set for it. It's a useful aid for maintaining a steady tempo as you begin to get better at playing.

, Sit on your piano bench with your music books on the sill of the piano, above the keyboard. Point your forearms towards the keys until they're parallel to the floor. If your bench is at the proper height, your fingers should gently arc downward and rest on the tops of the keys, without you having to bend your wrists or raise or lower your arms. Adjust the bench height until you feel no strain in your arms or shoulders when you sit at the piano. Make sure your shoulders and upper body is relaxed as well.


Rest your feet flat on the ground, a comfortable distance apart, with the toes pointing straight ahead. Sit with your feet in a firm stance. Sit with a straight back - your shoulders shouldn't hunch forward, and your spine should be straight. Scoot in until your hands rest on the keys without having to stretch your arms. You should be able to move your feet forward to the pedals and back again without putting any strain on your upper legs. While you hold this position your entire body should be relaxed.
If you don't have an adjustable piano bench, or it won't adjust high enough to make you comfortable, it's acceptable to use pads or pillows to further raise the height of your seat. Just be sure they're even in terms of thickness, and stable enough that you won't have to worry about them slipping as you play.

, You should be seated at the center of the keyboard. Each of your ten fingers should rest on one white key. Your right thumb rests on the white key just to the left of a group of two black keys in the middle of the keyboard, which is the C note. Each finger on your right hand rests on the next following white key, thus D, E, F, and G. Your left hand follows the same pattern one octave down, only reversed: the left pinky should rest on C, and the left thumb should rest on G. There should be two white keys (A and B) between your thumbs.


The C note that anchors your right thumb is in the center of the keyboard, and as such is often called “middle ” It's common for beginning players to use a sticker or a piece of tape to mark middle C. Just be sure it's something you can eventually clean off as you get better.
Learning the notes at the center first is conventional because a pianist must normally sit at the center of the keyboard to be able to reach every high and low note without standing up and moving.

, The keyboard of a piano repeats its notes from top to bottom across several octaves. This means that the notes change from low (left side) to high (right side), but don't vary in pitch. There are twelve notes to the chromatic scale on the piano: seven white key notes (C, D, E, F, G, A, B) and five black key notes (C-sharp/D-flat, D-sharp/E-flat, F-sharp/G-Flat, G-sharp/A-flat, and A-sharp/B-flat). Playing the white key notes from C through B and back to C creates the C major scale; playing the black key notes from C-sharp (next to the white C key) through B-flat creates a pentatonic (five tone) scale.


The piano is tuned for all major and minor keys using equal temperament tuning, making it a very versatile instrument.
It's easy to double-check a piano's tuning by playing pairs of the same note at different octaves. The notes should sound identical; if they don't, one or both of them is sharp or flat and needs to be re-tuned.

, Starting with middle C, gently but firmly push down on a key to produce a note. Take some time and try pushing slower and faster, softer and harder, until you have an idea of the kind of control you can exert over the sound of the piano. Without moving your hands, play all ten notes under your fingers. Note that some (such as the pinky) are more difficult to play loudly, while others (like the thumb) take practice to play softly.


Play black keys as well. Usually, you will be gradually introduced to these early when taking lessons by playing in the keys of G Major (1 sharp) and F Major (1 flat) for starters.

, Try playing notes starting with the pinky C of your left hand, all the way up to the thumb C of your right hand. Play each white key in order. Once you reach your left thumb, play the next note (A) with your middle finger. Then the next (B), with your pointer finger and lastly the thumb to middle C to finish the scale. Practice this until it begins to get easier – stretching your fingers is just as important as moving your hands, as your skills begin to improve.


Try playing a different scale. Start on one of the other fingers of your left hand, and play notes up the keyboard until you reach the same note on your right hand. Adjust sour notes by using black keys where necessary.

In addition to learning scales from a teacher or book, it's important to keep experimenting with them on your own so that you begin to get a head for them as quickly as possible.



, Although it doesn't take a lot of practice to be able to bang out “Hot Cross Buns” on a piano keyboard, unlocking all of your instrument's potential requires learning to play multiple notes at once on it, using all your fingers and both your hands. To achieve a nice sound with multiple notes, you have to understand how harmonies work. This is a very in-depth topic that can't be covered in full here, but you can use these notes to help guide your practice.


Playing more than one note at the same time is called harmonizing. The theories behind harmony can be very difficult to learn, but a good rule to start out with is to avoid playing many keys that are right next to each other.
The space between a harmony's notes is called its “interval.” The most common intervals in piano music are fifths, fourths, and thirds. To hear examples of these, play C and G, C and F, or C and E, respectively.
Harmony intervals go all the way up to the fourteenth interval, which is considered a compound interval since it crosses more than one octave. Harmonies can also be altered by introducing flat or sharp notes, adding support notes, and so on. However, you shouldn't have to worry too much about these more advanced styles for a while yet.

, The language of sheet music notation may seem difficult at first, but with a teacher or good guidebook and some practice, most people pick up the basics of it in just a few weeks. Being able to read sheet music opens up a whole world of compositions for you to learn and practice. Again, reading sheet music is a fairly involved procedure that won't be reviewed in full here; however, the very basics have been outlined below as a reference.


Music notes are represented by filled-in or empty oval marks (called heads), with or without other marks (stems, which are straight lines, and hooks, which come off of stems) on a set of horizontal lines called a staff that starts at a particular note, which must be memorized based on the clef, or symbol, at the front of the staff.

Different styles of note represent different lengths. A hollow head without a stem is a whole note; a filled-in head with a stem and a hook is an eighth note, which lasts one-eighth as long as a whole note. Your teacher or guidebook can explain all the different notes in greater detail.


Each note is placed from left to right the same way we read a book, and from high to low based on how high or low on the instrument it is. Notes placed along the same vertical line are meant to be played together.
To add structure and regularity, the notes are divided into measures or bars, which are noted by vertical lines through the staff. Each bar is to be played in the same length of time; thus, a few long notes or many shorter notes may fit into any given bar, but they must always add up to the same total.
Two numbers next to the clef at the start of the music make up the time signature. A time signature shows how many of what length of note are to be played per bar. The common 4/4 time signature, for example, indicates that four quarter notes are to be played per bar.
There are special symbols for pauses in play, called “rests.” Rests are written into bars and read just like notes.

, Many piano compositions require you to play one rhythm with one hand, and another with the other hand. In particular, your left hand will generally be playing low, backing notes, while your right hand picks out a higher melody. Like patting your head while you rub your stomach, this technique takes a little time to pick up. Practice by playing a melody with your right hand, and playing whole note harmonies with your left. (It is important to note that this technique won't work well for more advanced pieces)

, Eventually, you'll have to leave the middle C area of the keyboard and venture out towards the edges. Get used to the idea by sometimes playing your practice drills an octave lower or higher than normal. Sit as normal, and don't scoot down the bench – in a concert, you wouldn't have time to scoot from the low end to the high end. Instead, lean your torso slightly sideways (without bending your back or twisting), and stretch or contract your arms to reach the notes.


Try changing positions on the fly. Play something simple, like a scale or arpeggio, from a lower position than usual, and jump your hands up to continue it through a second octave. If you start with your left hand, let it cross lightly over your right and hold position above the proper keys just before you need it for the second octave. As you play those notes, draw your right hand back to its higher position as well.

, Long before the electric guitar, pianos were using effects pedals to change the sound quality of the music coming from the strings, with one model having 6. There are two or three pedals on most modern pianos, each of which has an important function. In classical compositions, special notation is used to show you when and how to use which pedal. Your piano teacher can explain them to you.


The soft pedal (also called ""una corda"") is usually on the left. It softens not only the volume, but also the tone color of the note being played. The soft pedal is used extensively in Beethoven's compositions, among others.
The sustaining pedal is on the right. It lifts the dampening elements off of the strings, allowing notes to ring, resonate, and blend much more easily. Clever use of the sustaining pedal can connect harmonies and notes in interesting and emotionally evocative ways, and it is commonly seen in compositions dating from the Romantics of the 19th century onward.
The third, central pedal is usually the sostenuto pedal if found on a grand piano. The sostenuto sustains notes, but only holds down the current note being played. On an upright piano, it's likely that the central pedal (when there is one) selectively holds down certain notes, normally in the lower register.

, The piano is one of the most difficult instruments to master, but also one of the most rewarding: the sound it makes is distinctive and impressive, and the skills required to play it well transfer easily to any of a number of other instruments. The key to getting good at playing the piano is to practice as much as possible, whenever possible. Plan to devote at least half an hour every day to playing it; if you can spend an hour or more, that's even better. Even if you feel as though you're making no headway, practice will eventually lead to improvement.

Listen.,
Assuming you already know some very basic theory, first learn all 12 major scales (there are twelve different sounding scales, but in theory B/Cb, F#/Gb and C#/Db are separate scales).,
Make sure you can read music and can play some basic stuff, even if it's not jazz.,
Buy a songbook of one of the masters: Cole Porter, Gershwin, etc.,
Learn a major 7th (1 3 5 7), minor 7th (1 b3 5 b7), dominant 7th (1 3 5 b7), half diminished (1 b3 b5 b7), and diminished chord (1 b3 b5 bb7) of every key.,
To reward your hard work, pull out the songbook.,
Even though it probably sounds horrible, practice for long enough and you'll sound more and more like what's written there without you even knowing it.,
Next, learn chord inversions: learn to play CM7 like (C, E, G, B), (E, G, B, C), (G, B, C, E) and (B, C, E, G).,
Learn the pentatonic scale of your favourite key.

,
Add in a couple of notes from it into a song you're comfortable with.,
Now learn the blues scale of that same key and mix the two.,
Look at the chord sequences in the songs you're playing.,
Learn the 3, 6, 2, 5, 1 progression.,
When you're ready, learn chromatic and diatonic harmony.",How to Play Jazz Piano," This is by far the most important step in becoming a musician. Find as many recordings as you can get your hands on. Don't discriminate--listen to the old greats, like Art Tatum and Count Basie and Thelonious Monk, as well as up-and-coming pianists of today. Listen, take what they do, and apply it to your own playing. Doing this consistently will make you an excellent jazz pianist.;
, Learning all the scales will be extremely helpful.

, The first real step in your journey will be to break away from ""the dots"" and train your ear. So...

, Make sure that chord symbols or guitar tabs are written above the melody line, like ""Dbm7.""

, So, for example, to play C7 (C dominant 7th) you'd play C, E, G, and Bb. For C diminished seventh, you'd play C, Eb Gb, and A (Bbb). You need to know them well enough to be able to see a chord symbol like the one in the step above and be able to play it without thinking. If you know your major scales, you could have this step mastered in a week.

, Find a song you like and play the melody line in the right hand with the appropriate chords in the left, as you're reading them from the chord symbols. You are now playing a song without reading music (in the traditional way, aka Fakebook style). Congratulations!

, You can always go back to the sheet music to see how they're voicing the chords in clever ways that you're not.

, Learn those four positions for every chord, but only after you're comfortable knowing what every chord is, and have Step Four under your belt. Don't scramble your brain.

,, Add some more, and take some of the originals out.

, By now, you're probably IMPROVISING! Learn those two scales for every key.

, Try to splice one from one song into another.

, Also learn tritone substitutions and the circle of fifths. Play the same songs in different keys.

, Learn modes and different scales. Listen to different sorts of music from all sorts of time periods, and anything that you can steal harmonic and melodic ideas from. When you've gotten this far, you can easily teach yourself.

Practice with a singer on piano -- much as it is often done on guitar like strumming.,
Play non-obnoxiously (not too loudly) as the basic technique.,
Break up the chords (arpeggio like strumming, harping) so that it is not like ""clump, clump..."" and lighten up as a piano accompanist, and even just use one hand to play the rhythm -- explained in more detail below.,
Use one hand to accompany on the piano.,
Practice rolling the notes by rocking or swaying your hand and fingers: going through each chord to play the notes separately.,
Think of a mental picture of the fingers as forming the same ""shape"" of


each three note chord like a 3 pronged fork or tripod and
a four note chord (7th) as a four pronged fork.

,
Experiment playing ""near"" middle C, and down an octave (or maybe up) from there to fit your chording to the singer(s).

,
Learn to get the chord from the key signatures.,
Write the chord changes above the words on a written or printed page like it is done for guitar.,
Interpret various piano styles by ear, and so you change tempo and the chord like for changing the key up or down as necessary.,
Leave the melody for the singer to do, and so you chord cleverly and rhythmically during the vocals (something like strumming, playing rhythm).,
Play bass notes with your left hand.",How to Accompany a Singer on Piano1," So, you will follow the singer's lead and not:


Play the notes of the ""melody"" while the singer is voicing them,
Or set the ""tempo"" as the soloist may have slow and fast parts for emphasis, etc.
Or decide the ""rhythm"" if the singer has an interpretation,

So, you do not decide the ""style""... Don't do the singer's job. Talk about it with your soloist! Most soloists want you to follow them, but others may need you to keep a steady beat (a little like a drum might do) so that they have something to keep them on track. Everyone is different as to what they need, so simply ask. A trained soloist may be able to tell you what works best for him or her. Generally, you play ""accompagnato"" -- following everything that they do (tempo, and overall style) of the soloist's interpretation of the song.

;
, Think about accompanying in a group with a guitar player who can lightly strum chords while the drummer may use brushes or soft drumming style, etc. but of course some singers, as an alternative, may have a style where the instruments are pretty loud...

, Using the piano for accompanying will often involve both hands for turn around parts, left hand or right hand chording variations, ideas like the Circle of Fifths, and adapting to what your soloist does by recognizing the style and responding to the tempo, rhythm and style by ear. You probably (but not necessarily) need to do an introduction with both hands and do an ending.


Once you get more advanced and start using both hands, it is okay to not play chords as arpeggios and instead play all the keys at once. However, playing an entire song without arpeggios can get repetitive to listeners. Try to vary your playing; analyse the song and figure out where you should aim for arpeggio playing and where you should not.

If you are a beginner and plan to only use one hand, arpeggios are to recommend.



, Sure there is more to learn to be a good piano accompanist. See chords in ""Tips"" below.


It's not just playing chords with one hand lightly -- mostly using 3 tones called triad chords (see Chords, and Picturing the ""Shapes of Chords"" On Your Fingers and Hands -- in the ""Tips"" section below)

,


You don't make the chords as clumping sounds.

,,, You will see a pattern in the key signatures as they progress by every fifth lettered key/note in the ""circle of fifths"".


So, each key is in a musical interval (spacing) referred to as fifth from its neighboring key (just counting, not fractions).
In the key signatures that contain flats, the name of the key is ""the flat to the left of the last flat."" A key signature with four flats, B, E, A, D, for example, is the key of A flat.

, There is a studio-professional way to do that using Nashville lead sheet notations. It is for a rhythm section (usually consisting of piano, guitar, drums and bass). The musicians practice to be able to improvise to present the chord in a blend with other instruments. That numbered method of notation allows musicians who are familiar with keys and chords to play the same song in any key that one knows without written sheet music., This is not an amateur trick: there is a free downloadable software created by Harvey Mudd College computer programming department for this kind of notational work for orchestras to use, etc..

, So you hit individual notes of the chord as mentioned using a form of arpeggio (also called broken chords). That's the technique in short, as the essence of the idea.


See the pattern of the ""Circle of Fifths"" is based on counting every 5th note. In any part of ""A"" through ""G"" -- then notes can be thought of as starting over forming a circle. After G, think of a, b, c, D, and so look at the circle and ""G and ""D"" are fifths because there are 3 notes between them (counting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) backward or forward.
So you can count five in the musical alphabet: ignoring the three notes between the 1st and the 5th one. Then look at the circle and see ""D and A are fifths"": D, e, f, g, A. That is how the key signature pattern works, and that shows how the circle got its name.

, Once you get comfortable playing chords with your right hand, you can start using your left hand. Most commonly you will play the keynote of the chord (so you will only play one note with the left hand, do NOT play entire chords) one or several octaves below your right hand playing the chords.

The keynote in a chord is always the same note as the chord's name. So for instance, in the C chord the keynote is C, in the F chord it is F. So when playing a C chord in the right hand, play a C (only the note, not the chord) with your left hand one or more octaves to the left of your right hand.

Sometimes chords will not have the keynote as the bass note, this is notated via the chord's name, a slash, and then the note that should be the bass note. For example: C/E means that you are to play a C chord with your right hand, but play the key E with your left as a bass note. (Note that E is the third in the C chord, and you should avoid doubling thirds, so when you play a chord with the third in the bass, you may leave out the third in the chord that you play with your right hand.)


When starting out, you can simply play and hold the keynote with your left hand every chord change or at the start of each measure, while your right hand plays chords normally.
If you're more advanced you can let the left hand have it's own rhythm and even create your own bass line.

"
"
Know that (usually) the left hand takes care of playing chords using arpeggio, called broken chords, or the usual unified chords for the left hand to play for tenor and bass notes in the scale while the right hand is usually playing the melody and/or alto part(s)...;
,
Find the key; so for example, C major is the easiest; it is called the common key/common chord.,
Figure out the notes of the melody.,
Suppose you have notes G and C in the melody and the song is in the ""key of G Major,"" try playing a C Major chord (C-E-G) arpeggiated and try a G Major chord (G-B-D) arpeggio (breaking the chords).,
Find chords in the major scales as the I-IV-V: that means the Tonic(I), the sub-dominant(IV), and the Dominant(V) based on circle of notes of the key of the song.,
Write the chords (when they are decided upon) above the words using the most common chord progressions.,
Include these progressions which are commonly used: I IV V I -- I vi IV V -- I ii IV V -- vi IV I V -- I V vi iii IV I ii V where each numeral means to use the chords named by the notes in that key's ""circle of notes"" with the ""tonic"" as 1st (I) ""doh"" of the key on up to the (VII) 7th and then ""recycle."",
Play chords in normal order, low to high: like ""C-E-G"", generally -- and then when it is necessary to consider changing the chord (consider usual chord progressions).,
Use that C chord inversions (which are not in order low to high) to use when the chords on the song do not change, but then you can have a slightly different sound by the inversions.,
Understand that if the lower notes B through D are used in the melody, then the fundamental or root position of the C chord would be used.,
Do you want to write your melody although you may not read music well.,
Join professional ranks using ""Nashville lead sheet/Nashville notations"" of numbering (not lettering) the chords.",How to Add Piano Chords to any Melody,", (And, it helps if you understand at least the basic chords and some music theory for harmony, etc.)

, You have to make the chords fit the melody notes -- not the other way around. Try to avoid clashing notes. There are several ways to do this. If the song has a ""left hand"" look in it, and if the structure isn't too complicated, listen to the section you're putting a chord into and decide if it is major or minor.

, Unless the song is really complicated, one of those should fit. By simply analyzing the section in which you're placing a chord, the tonic (first note, I) of the melody chord/key will usually be seen here and there in the bar(s) of the melody where you are looking to fit your chord.

, For the minor scales the roman numerals for chords are lowercase i-iv-v: that's the tonic(i) sub-dominant(iv) and dominant(v)... Write these down somewhere so you can refer to them, because they will come up a lot in theory of harmony!

, You can start by using chords I and V (first and fifth) ""of the scale of the key"" are very commonly used. So the 1st chord of the scale for the key C Major is the tonic (I) ""C Major"" chord (C-E-G) and then chord ""(V) is G Major"" (G-B-D) and so use whichever sounds better in progressions upward and downward in different parts of the song...

,


Just repeat these chords to the beat if you're not sure, and write down the one that sounds the nicest. Don't be afraid to mix them around if you find another chord sounds nicer!

, The chord is highly dependent on which melody notes are being used in that part of the song. So an understanding of theory is helpful -- if for example: the notes of the melody are in the key of C (C-E-G) then you have the sub-dominant ""4th chord (F)"" which fits right in, or chord the ""fifth chord (G)"", and of course ""B (the VII)"" may work as it closely relates to ""G7"", and naturally D, F chords may be comfortable, all being in, of or near C Major.

, Thus, depending on what notes are used like high notes ""G or A"" in the melody then the second inversion of the C chord could accompany this group.

, If, however, the higher notes (E, F, or sometimes G) are used, the first inversion of C would be played to give a different tonality.

, Many a musician can play in a rhythm section -- does not read much music -- but learns and plays harmony to the melody by blending among other instrumentalists by ear (improvising).


The notes of the melody are not the first consideration for strumming, picking, and arpeggio piano chording kind of musician... who is in key and harmonizes to the key, but is not really ""clued"" to knowing the exact melody line or harmony theory...

One may be a good recording session player or band member par excellence by knowing chords inside and out without reading the sheet music, ie: for purposes of commercial/professional entertainment or church music!



, This allows playing chords in any key as the tonic to a melody and to allow easy key changes by counting up and down by musical steps and 1/2 steps (sharps and flats)...

"
"
Show two or more singers the harmony of the three most basic chords: ""1,3,5"" chords (which are just the key of C or key of F or key of G) which have no sharps, no flats, etc.,
Demonstrate chords to the singers and help them to hear how the different note combinations (chords) sound when working together.,
Harmonize by singing ""to the melody"" but in a slightly lower or higher pitch to create a chord with voices.,
Add a 7th for a fourth voice in harmony and/or the 1st (or root) note, up one octave (for unison).

,
Learn the basic 1,3,5,7 major chord notes (C7, F7, G7 -- see ""Tips"" below), as a group, and then you can help singers harmonize by their consistently carrying one of the chord notes; after they learn to hear them in the chord (and so they hear harmony) among voices.",How to Accompany a Singer on Piano2," The 1 represents the ""root"" (fundamental) note. The 3 represents ""the 3rd,"" or the note 2 places up. The 5 represents ""the 5th,"" which is 4 places up from the root and 2 places up from the 3rd. Each note skipped is called an interval (creating a pleasing separation between the ones that are sounded out).

, It's easier to learn basics of harmony by hearing the notes played on a piano. Then one can start to sing along with the piano notes. Then they can move on to singing the harmony with another singer.


A good step is to distinguish 2 or 3 singers each singing the melody an octave higher or lower than the other which is just singing in unison but is not harmonizing.
For example: the male lead singing the melody an octave low ""versus"" a female soprano are in unison (not harmony). Singing unison is ""layering,"" and may enhance sound as in a choir (but a duet, trio or quartet is not normally unison, except for some special effect).

,


But, if a soloist sings a harmony note instead of the melody, that is a form of singing off key...

,, Bad harmony is being inconsistent, and so traveling from ones note to the note of someone else (off key).


If there are more than 3 people you can have 2 or more singing each of the notes as in a choral group. Once you have a sense of the basics of harmonizing the ""1, 3, 5 and 1, 3, 5, 7"" you may experiment with other kinds of notes in other chords which have sharps or flats.

"
"
Understand chords generally consist of at least ""three"" notes/pitches/tones (Let's call them notes.)",How to Accompany a Singer on Piano3," sounded together. If you speak of only two notes that are to be sounded then that is known as an interval (like a distance).
The C chord made of the notes ""C-E-G"" some indicated sharps and flats -- which would make whole different chords. Double click the photo to see it larger.

""C"" chord:






""F"" chord:






""G"" chord: The simpler three note chords shown above are major chords in order ""C, F, and G"" that are made up of only white keys spaces exactly the same way.






Notice that C chord is exactly the same shape (same fingering) as F and G chords in the photos using sticky notes on a keyboard above... but C shown as three notes on lines of sheet music also shows that concept
These three note chords are called triads or triadic formed by a ""formula"" like a pattern. Chords may have more than three notes (not needed for this basic accompaniment work): for example, a chord of 4, 5 or 6 notes are called tetrads, pentads and hexads (also called tetrachords, pentachords and hexachords).

Also, some chords may be complicated by spaced out combinations of notes that are called ""perfect,"" ""augmented,"" or ""diminished"", etc. for more complex chords.

Number the fingers and thumb of the left hand ""5, 4, 3, 2, 1"" starting at the little finger (5) going to the thumb (1).

,
Visualize that the shape of the hand for ""C, F, and G"" are all the same.,
Number the fingers and thumb of the right hand ""1, 2, 3, 4, 5"" starting at the little thumb (1) going to the little finger (5).",How to Accompany a Singer on Piano5,", That shape (like a formula) uses fingers ""5, 3, and 1"". The other 3-note major chords use the same fingering shape:

find the fundamental note (C or F or G), and






go across the ivory keys to the third note using the third finger and
to the ivory fifth note using the fifth finger (the thumb).


So, the formula for those three chords is simply left to right on the left hand (5, 3, 1).






""D"" Chord:
""A"" chord: Notice that D chord is exactly the same shape (same spacing of fingers) as A in the photos... but D shown as three notes on lines of sheet music does not show that idea. The shape of the hand for A or D chord is almost the same as C, F, or G -- but A or D has the middle fingered-note ""sharped"" (""sharping"" or ""flatting"" is really only a half step between notes). So, they both have a black key for the middle finger -- left to right on the left hand (5, 3#, 1) where the ""#"" symbol means ""sharp"" which is most often the black key ""up"", toward the right, on the keyboard...






But, where two ivory keys are together (without a black one between them) then a white key is the sharp in some chords and scales.
Flats work the same way but are moving downward (leftward on the keyboard) in the flow of the music.


The combination for a chord of three or more notes sounded together at certain distances between the notes (like one step) are based on a pattern (or formula) for the chord like ""5, 3, 1.""







,


Play the same chords on the right hand with the same kind of shape with the thumb and fingers again numbered left to right ""1 through 5"" but now you're starting from the thumb (1) to the right little finger (5);and though hands look opposite -- just ignore the thumb and finger switching, and so it is still the same shaped tripod (Note: both hands left to right are ""5, 4, 3, 2, 1 and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5."")

So you can think of the numbering with right hand: ""1, 3, 5"" while the left was ""5, 3, 1"" (of course, also ""1, 3#, 5"" compared to ""5, 3#, 1"", follow this kind of shape pattern).

See 7th chords are four note chords: The following fingerings work for all major and minor 7th chords (the little finger plays a 7th) on the keyboard, skipping the ring finger.",How to Accompany a Singer on Piano6,"


For example: G7 Chord is found by counting G as 1st on The Circle then 1-3-5-7 makes that G-B-D-F see that all have an interval of one.

Left hand fingering for this chord is 5-3-2-1 (just skip the ""ring finger""). Pinkie - G, middle finger - B, index finger - D and thumb - F.
Right hand is the same fingering ""reversed"" so it is 1-2-3-5 (again skip the ""ring finger""). Thumb - G, index - B, middle - D and pinkie - F.

Look for chords in sheet music.",How to Play Major Chords on a Keyboard," A chord is three or more notes. Complex chords may have many notes, but you need a minimum of three.


The chords discussed here will all be composed of three notes: a root, a third and a fifth.;
, Every major chord is built on a note called the tonic, or root of the chord. This is the note that the chord is named after and will be the lowest note in the chord.


For a C major chord, C is the tonic. It will be the bottom note of your chord.
You will play the tonic note with your thumb in your right hand, or with your pinkie in your left hand.

, The second note in a major chord is the major third, which gives the chord its character. It will be four semitones, or half-steps, above the root. It is called a third because when you play a scale in that key, it will be the third note that you hit.


For a C major chord, E is the third. It is four half steps above C. You can count them on your piano (C#, D, D#, E).
You will play the third with your middle finger, regardless of which hand you’re using.
Try playing the root and the third together, to get a sense of how that interval is supposed to sound.

, The top note in a major chord is called the fifth because if you play a scale it will be the fifth note that you hit. It anchors the chord and makes it complete. It is seven semi-tones above the root.For a C major chord, G is the fifth. You can count the seven semi-tones up from the root on your piano. (C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G.)
You play the fifth with your pinkie in your right hand, or your thumb in your left.

, All notes can be written at least two different ways, for example Eb and D# are the same note. Therefore, an Eb major chord would sound the same as D# major chord.


The notes Eb, G, Bb create an Eb chord. The notes D#, F𝄪 (F##), A# create a D# Major chord, which sounds exactly like an Eb chord.
The two chords are called enharmonic equivalents because they sound exactly the same but are written differently.A few of the common enharmonic equivalents are noted below, but otherwise the article presents only the most common notation of a major chord.

, In order to play a piece of piano music well, you need to consistently use the correct hand position, even when you’re just practicing chords.


Keep your fingers tall and curved, as if they are diving into the keys. Use the natural curve of your fingers.
Use the weight of your arms rather than the strength of your fingers to push on the keys.Play on the tips of your fingers, including if possible the pinkie and thumb which tend to lie flat if you’re not paying attention.
Keep your fingernails trimmed close so that you can play using the tips of your fingers.

, Notice that you will only use fingers 1, 3 and 5 (thumb, middle, pinkie) to play the three notes of each chord. Your index and ring fingers may rest on, but not press down any keys.

Notice that your fingers advance one half-step (one key) up the keyboard each time you change chords.

, The three notes will be C, E, G. Remember, C = tonic (0), E = major third (4 semi-tones), G = fifth (7 semi-tones).


Right hand fingering will place your thumb on C, your middle finger on E and your pinkie on G.






Left hand fingering will place your pinkie on C, your middle finger on E and your thumb on G.







, The three notes will be Db, F, Ab. Remember, Db = tonic (0), F = major third (4 semi-tones), Ab = fifth (7 semi-tones). The enharmonic equivalent of this chord is C# Major. Notice that Db could also be noted as C#. F can also be written in music as E#. Ab can also be written as G#. The notes you play will be the same whether it is written as Db Major or C# Major.


Right hand fingering will place your thumb on Db, your middle finger on F and your pinkie on Ab.






Left hand fingering will place your pinkie on Db, your middle finger on F and your thumb on Ab.







, The three notes will be D, F#, A. Remember, D = tonic (0), F# = major third (4 semi-tones), A = fifth (7 semi-tones).


Right hand fingering will place your thumb on D, your middle finger on F# and your pinkie on A.






Left hand fingering will place your pinkie on D, your middle finger on F# and your thumb on A.







, The three notes will be Eb, G, Bb. Remember, Eb = tonic (0), G = major third (4 semi-tones), Bb = fifth (7 semi-tones).


Right hand fingering will place your thumb on Eb, your middle finger on G and your pinkie on Bb.






Left hand fingering will place your pinkie on Eb, your middle finger on G and your thumb on Bb.







, The three notes will be E, G#, B. Remember, E = tonic (0), G# = major third (4 semi-tones), B = fifth (7 semi-tones).


Right hand fingering will place your thumb on E, your middle finger on G# and your pinkie on B.






Left hand fingering will place your pinkie on E, your middle finger on G# and your thumb on B.







, The three notes will be F, A, C. Remember, F = tonic (0), A = major third (4 semi-tones), C = fifth (7 semi-tones).


Right hand fingering will place your thumb on F, your middle finger on A and your pinkie on C.






Left hand fingering will place your pinkie on F, your middle finger on A and your thumb on C.







, The three notes will be F#, A#, C#. Remember, F# = tonic (0), A# = major third (4 semi-tones), C# = fifth (7 semi-tones). The enharmonic equivalent of this chord is Gb Major which will be written as Gb, Bb, Db. Note that F# can also be written as Gb. A# can also be written as Bb. C# can also be written as Db. So the notes you play to make a major chord will be the same in F# Major and Gb Major.


Right hand fingering will place the thumb on F#, the middle finger on A# and the pinkie on C#.






Left hand fingering will place the pinkie on F#, the middle finger on A# and the thumb on C#.







, The three notes will be G, B, D. Remember, G = tonic (0), B = major third (4 semi-tones), D = fifth (7 semi-tones).


Right hand fingering will place the thumb on G, the middle finger on B and the pinkie on D.






Left hand fingering will place the pinkie on G, the middle finger on B and the thumb on D.







, The three notes will be Ab, C, Eb. Remember, Ab = tonic (0), C = major third (4 semi-tones), Eb = fifth (7 semi-tones). The enharmonic equivalent of this chord is G# Major which will be written as G#, B#, D#. Note that Ab can also be written as G#. C can also be written as B#. Eb can also be written as D#. The notes you play to make a major chord will be the same for Ab Major and G# major, although they will be noted differently.


Right hand fingering will place your thumb on Ab, your middle finger on C and your pinkie on Eb.






Left hand fingering will place your pinkie on Ab, your middle finger on C and your thumb on Eb.







, The three notes will be A, C#, E. Remember, A = tonic (0), C# = major third (4 semi-tones), E = fifth (7 semi-tones).


Right hand fingering will place your thumb on A, your middle finger on C# and your pinkie on E.






Left hand fingering will place your pinkie on A, your middle finger on C# and your thumb on E.







, The three notes will be Bb, D, F. Remember, Bb = tonic (0), D = major third (4 semi-tones), F = fifth (7 semi-tones).


Right hand fingering will place the thumb on Bb, the middle finger on D and the pinkie on F.






Left hand fingering will place the pinkie on Bb, the middle finger on D, and the thumb on F.







, The three notes will be B, D#, F#. Remember, B = tonic (0), D# = major third (4 semi-tones), F# = fifth (7 semi-tones).


Right hand fingering will place the thumb on B, the middle finger on D# and the pinkie on F#.






Left hand fingering will place the pinkie on B, the middle finger on D# and the thumb on F#.







, When you feel comfortable playing each chord individually, try skipping up the scale with each major chord. Start with a C major chord, then play a Db major, then D major and so on.


Begin by doing this exercise with only one hand. When you feel confident, play both hands at once.
Listen for false notes. The ratio between the notes should always remain the same, so if one chord suddenly sounds different, review whether you are hitting the correct notes.

, An arpeggio is when each note is struck in sequence from lowest to highest. To play a C Major arpeggio with your right hand, strike the C with your thumb and release. Strike E with your middle finger and release. Strike G with your pinkie and release.


When you have mastered this motion, try to make it fluid rather than choppy. Strike and release each note quickly, so there is scarcely any time between notes.

, Inversions of a chord use the same notes, but place a different note on the bottom. For example, a C major chord is C, E, G. The first inversion of the C-major chord is E, G, C. The second inversion is G, C, E.


Challenge yourself by making a major chord with every note on the scale, in every inversion.

, Once you are familiar with how to construct and play a chord, find a piece of music that has chords written. Look to see if you can identify major chords that you have practiced.

Begin with chromatics at a tempo of 120 BPM (or 60 BPM if you're just starting out), one note per beat.,
After the chromatics, do whole-steps on each string, four notes per string, one finger per note per string, to help with the stretching and warming up.,
Go to the 12th fret of your highest pitched string and begin doing 8 full bends with each finger on that string, alternating after every four.,
Begin playing chromatics again at 160 BPM (or 80-100 BPM), one note per beat, one finger per fret.

,
Begin playing scales, in one key, at 120 (or 60) beats per minute, one note per beat.,
Begin playing different scales in one key and different positions at 120 BPM without skipping a beat.,
Take a scale you know all modes of, and choose a key.,
Find the fastest tempo you can play in time and chose and scale and play every mode of it.",How to Warm up on Bass Guitar," Do this for a minute or two, using one finger per fret on your fretting hand, and using at least two fingers on your plucking hand, alternating each one.;
, Do this at 120 BPM (or, once again, at 60 BPM), one note per beat. Do this for one or two minutes.

, Do this with every string. After that re-tune your instrument, if needed.

,, Any real scale (any scale besides the chromatic) will do. After playing each mode in succession move it up or down half a step and proceed doing it in the next key. Keep doing this until you have done every mode of every key you know, this will not only physically warm up your muscles and stretch your muscles, joints, and tendons out, but it will also give your ears and brain a good warm-up.

, This will warm you up and help you get used to different scales.

, Play this scale using the hopscotch method.

, Do this for a minute or two.

Play the E note on an instrument.,
Tune the thickest string on your bass.,
Tune the string neighboring the E string.,
Tune the neighboring, un-tuned string next to A.,
Tune the final string of your bass.",How to Tune a Bass Guitar1," You'll want to make sure that the instrument you are tuning to is in tune before tuning to it. Some instruments, like the piano, stay in tune for long periods of time and are excellent tools for tuning your bass.


The E note on a keyboard can be found by locating the white key immediately after a series of two black keys in a row. Any key immediately after a series of two black keys is E.
Other instruments that have recently been tuned, like a guitar or trumpet, can also be used to tune the E string of your bass.
When you play your reference E note on an instrument, clear your head and try to hold onto the E note's pitch as clearly as possible. This is the first note you'll be tuning to.;
, This string is also known as the E string. As you play this note, hold on to the reference E note you just played on an instrument in your head. You should notice that the notes aren't exactly the same. To tune your E string, you should:









Locate the tuning pegs at the top of the neck of your bass. Each peg should correspond to one of the strings. Find the peg that corresponds to your E string. It should be the peg nearest the body of the guitar.
Turn the E peg to change the pitch of your string to match the reference E note. In most cases, instruments go flat (low) over time, so you'll likely have to turn the peg counterclockwise.
When the reference E note and the pitch made by playing the E string are the same, your E string is tuned., This is also known as the A string. The A string corresponds to the white keyboard note that immediately precedes the farthest right black key in a three black key series. Play your reference note and hold it in your head, then play the A string. Tune the string by:








Adjusting the A string tuning peg. In most cases, the A tuning peg will be the second closest peg to the body of the guitar. Turn this peg to change the pitch made by the A string.
In most cases, instruments go flat over time, so it's most likely that you'll have to turn your A tuning peg counterclockwise to make its sound sharper/higher.
If you are new to tuning a stringed instrument, it's not uncommon to turn your tuning peg to far and have to go the opposite direction. Be patient, and match the reference note carefully.
When the reference A note and the A string of your bass are exactly the same, the A string is tuned., This is the D string of your bass guitar. You're going to have to tune it to D on your reference instrument. On a keyboard, you can find D by locating the key directly in between two black keys. Play your reference note and hold it firmly in your mind, then:









Play your D string. You should notice that the sound of your bass's D string doesn't match perfectly with your reference note.
Adjust the D string tuning peg. This peg is usually the peg third closest to the body of the guitar. Turn the tuning peg until your D string matches your reference note perfectly., This is the G string. To tune this string, you'll need to play a G on a reference instrument, like a keyboard. On a keyboard, G can be found by locating the white note immediately after the farthest left black note in a series of three black notes. To tune the string, you should:









Play your G string. Compare the note to your reference note. It's likely going to be flat, so you'll have to change the sound of the string with its tuning peg.
Find and adjust the G string tuning peg. This should be the peg farthest away from the body of the guitar. Turn the peg until it matches the pitch of your reference note. Your bass is tuned."
"
Avoid interval tuning when playing with other instruments.,
Play your thickest string fretted on the fifth fret.,
Tune the un-tuned string next to A.,
Finish with your final string.",How to Tune a Bass Guitar2," Interval tuning will make sure your strings are in tune with each other, but will not tune your bass to the actual pitch. Interval tuning is perfect for solo playing or for situations where you have no other method of tuning.


If you are playing with a group and nobody has a tuner, you could interval tune your bass and then have other players tune their instruments to yours. As long as everyone tunes to the same root, the players should sound in tune., This is also known as the E string. Playing the E string fretted at the fifth fret will produce a similar sound to that of its neighbor, the A string, when played unfretted (open). These notes should be the same. To achieve this:









Alternate between playing your fifth fretted E string and your open A string. Hold the two tones in your head as best you can.
Adjust the A tuning peg to change the A string to match the fifth fretted E string note. The A tuning peg, in most cases, will be the second from the body of the guitar., This is the D string. Now that A has been tuned to the E string, you can use A to tune D. Play A string while holding the fifth fret, then alternate and play the D string open. These tones should be the same. To tune your D string:









Play both notes and try to hold each in your head. The D string note will be tuned to the fifth fretted A string by adjusting its tuning peg.
The D string tuning peg should be the third closest to the body of your guitar. Turn the peg until the tone made by your D string matches that of your fifth fretted A string., This is also known as the G string. Since D has been tuned relative to A, you can use D to tune G. Fret D again while holding the fifth fret and play the note. Then play the G string open. Both these should be the same, so you'll need to:









Alternate between notes and try to hold both in your head. The G string pitch will need to be adjusted through its tuning peg.
The G string tuning peg is usually the farthest peg from the body of your guitar. Turn this peg while alternating between fifth fretted D and open G until the notes match. Your bass is tuned."
"
Turn on your tuner.,
Set or check your tuning note.,
Tune to your tuner.,
Make use of online tools when a tuner is unavailable.",How to Tune a Bass Guitar3," Depending on the brand of tuner available, you may need to press a button, flip a switch, or simple open your tuner to turn it on. As there are many different models of tuner, you'll have to follow your tuner's direction for best results.










Desktop tuners are small devices that can be set up on flat surfaces, like a desk or music stand, while tuning. These frequently have ¼"" input/output to connect to both bass and amp.

Clip on tuners are generally very convenient for practice, though these can be unsightly if left on during a performance. You should clip these onto your headstock when tuning., Some simple tuners may only tune to a single note, but you might be able to set other tuners to whatever note you please. This information should be displayed clearly and prominently on the screen of your tuner.


Most electronic tuners these days comes with a LED screen color coded red and green. Red generally implies that you are off pitch, while green implies you are nearing it.
You may find that your tuner has an ""auto-tune"" function to help beginners tune open (unfretted) strings., This might require you to set your tuner first before playing a string and adjusting its tuning peg to tune your bass. After the tuner is set, play strings one at a time and follow the tuner screen indicators to tune each string by adjusting each corresponding tuning peg.








You won't have to alternate between strings like with the interval method or hold a pitch in your head like when tuning to another instrument when using a tuner.
Be careful not to accidentally mismatch strings and tuning pegs. Doing so will mean you'll have to re-tune.

, When you're in a pinch and you don't have a tuner on hand, you could always look up a free bass guitar tuner online on your phone or computer. There are even guitar tuning apps you can download to your phone so you're never without one.


Depending on your phone and the quality of the app/website tuning service, some of these online tuners may be low quality.

, Use a reference tone from a tuning device or a tuning fork to tune the bass. The bass is tuned (from above) E A D G where E is the lowest pitch and G is the highest pitch. Learning how to tune the bass is very similar to learning how to Tune-a-Guitar.

Remember the order with this mnemonic:Everyone Admires Dignified Guitarists.
, Plug one end of the audio cable into your amplifier and the other end into the bass. Turn the amplifier on. When done playing turn it off. First learn the difference between volume and gain on the amplifier. Adjust pots on the bass until you have a nice sound. The basics of setting up the bass amplifier are similar to that of a guitar amplifier (see Connect-an-Electric-Guitar-to-a-Combo-Amp.

, Adjust the strap so that playing feels comfortable. Place your right hand above the strings. You may rest the lower arm on the bass. Find a position along the strings where the sound is full between the fretboard and the other end.

, Use the index and middle fingers of your right hand to pluck the strings. Try to isolate the plucking to your fingers, thereby minimizing wrist and arm movement. Learn how to alternate between index and middle fingers. Practice switching between strings in a I-M-I-M pattern where I is index finger and M is middle finger. You may use your thumb as support on the back side of the bass.Alternatively, you may wish to learn to play the bass with a pick. If this is the case, buy a heavy gauge guitar pick. Hold the pick between your index finger (between the first and second knuckles) and your thumb. Then pluck the string by moving the pick downward across it and then upward across it. Practice this down-up plucking motion. If you are unsure as to which technique is best for you, try both.

, When learning how to play bass, ideally a string should never vibrate with another.

, Place your both hands on the bass and try to become as comfortable with your left hand as possible in the direction of the tuning pins of the bass. With your left hand place your index finger on the first fret and your other fingers on adjacent frets.

, Continue for each string A (A# B C C#), D (D# E F F#) and G (G# A A# B).

, Avoid the sound of loose left hand fingers.

, Use a metronome. First, try playing notes using the open E string on each beat of the metronome. These are called quarter notes. Start slowly and gradually speed up the tempo (or speed at which the metronome clicks) as you become comfortable playing in time. Then, start slowly again and attempt to play on each click of the metronome (or beat), as well as once halfway between each beat. These are called eighth notes. Finally, start slowly again, and attempt to play one note on each beat, halfway between each beat, and halfway between each of these. That is to say your first note should line up with a click of the metronome, and you should play three more notes before you hear the next click. These are called sixteenth notes. Be sure to keep each note even with all the others at each step.

, Look for beginners tablature on the internet.

,, This is all of the notes in the key of E and is the easiest scale on the bass. Play the E string open, then the E string on the second fret, the E string on the fourth fret, the open A string (or the E string on the fifth fret, as they are the same note), the A string on the second fret, the A string on the fourth fret, the D string on the first fret, and finally the D string on the second fret. Then try going back down the scale and up again until you are comfortable with it. Then, you can learn other scales by playing higher. For instance, the F major scale is the same pattern, you just play each note one fret down the neck (E string first fret, E string third fret, E string fifth fret, A string first fret, etc.). The F# major scale will be two frets down, the G major scale will be three frets down, and so forth.

, The bassist is often thought of as the liaison between the drummer and the rest of the band. This is due to the fact that the bassist is heavily involved in setting the beat of a song, as well as often forming the root of the chords the rest of the band are playing. Thus, you should work very closely with the drummer and work together to keep the tempo.

, The hammer-on is a common technique where a note is played without plucking the string. To do this, try playing the E string on the third fret. While you still hear the note, switch to the fifth fret. You can apply this basic technique to playing any two notes in sequence on the same string.

, Vibrato is a common technique in music used to add texture. To use vibrato, slightly bend the string back and forth with the fretting finger while you still hear the note. Do so faster and faster until you can barely make out the specific times when the tone shifts up or down. With practice, you should be able to add vibrato to sustained notes.

, Aim for playing it in time, with the right intonation. You can see if the song has bass tab available, in which case you should start slow from the tab before playing with a recording of the song. It will be more difficult to learn a song without tab or sheet music, but it can still be done. Find out what chord progression the song has, and try just playing the roots of the chords in rhythm. Then, try using a common bass ""walk"" along with those chords to add to it. This may not be the exact part you hear on the track, but it will still sound good.

, Some good songs for fans of classic rock basslines include: ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction"" by The Rolling Stones, ""You Really Got Me"" by The Kinks, ""Crossroads"" by Cream, ""My Generation"" by The Who, and ""Eight Days a Week"" by The Beatles.

Start a band, best way to learn to play.",How to Start Playing the Bass Guitar," Having strong fingers helps, seeing as how the bass strings are a fair bit thicker than those of the guitar.;
, Learn to use your index and middle fingers to pluck the strings of a bass. There are no down-strokes and up-strokes in bass,(unless using a pick) every note you make will be from one of your fingers pulling the string towards your face. Or, you can use your hand, like a pick, and put your thumb and pointer-finger together and strum.

, While you usually may not break a bass string like you can very easily the high E of a guitar, you risk breaking other, more crucial parts of the bass like the neck itself.

, You'll need a good starter amp. About 10 to 15 watts is good if you don't plan to play with anyone. Or, if you do, get something bigger. I went to Sam Ash, and found a 200 watt amp; it shook the store.

, Try to find something that really catches your attention. Generally a lot of alternative rock uses a strong bass note on the 1 and 3 of a beat, but nothing else. Jazz, blues, classic rock, some metal, and some punk are some fun alternatives when you're looking for new songs to play. Also, try to get a Precision/P-Bass, they can usually do well with all types.

, If you are serious about becoming a good bass player, you will need to know your music. Just keep in mind that the music theory was born from the music, not the other way around. Feel free to experiment!

, Your scales are your fundamentals. You'll refer back to your scales when you begin to construct bass-lines. Start with the 5 note blues scale and 6 note blues scale.

, And not just other bassists. Listen to the drummer who keeps the time and rhythm.

, Rule of thumb: If the bass is less than $100, you will outplay your bass in a matter of months. Don't waste all your money on the first bass- you can always go back to get a new one. start with a bass-pack that includes:Amp, Guitar, Strings, Strap, Chords.

, The bassist and drummer in most bands set and keep the tempo and form the real feeling of the song. The bass and drums also really control the dynamics of the group, so if you want a loud crescendo, then don't crank the guitar: crank the bass and have the drummer play louder, then the guitarist should turn up appropriately. The bass and drums are the key to making a song work; remember that without them, the guitar sounds puny and weak.

, I'm still at this step because people around here aren't very... musically talented.

Identify the repeating pattern of keys on the piano.,
Identify the black keys.,
Find the octave the note is in.,
Learn what the notes look like.",How to Learn Keyboard Notes1," Find the note ""C"" on your keyboard, as shown in the image below. This is the first note of the C Major scale: C, D, E, F, G, A, B, and back to C.









Note the pattern of white keys: three white keys enclosing two black keys, and four white keys enclosing three black keys.
You can also see it this way: the black keys repeat a five-key pattern of two black keys separated by one white key, then two white keys, then three black keys separated by one white key, then two white keys.
This pattern is constant on all keyboards. Every note on the keyboard is represented in this single 12-note octave—they're just higher or lower in pitch.;
, Using the image below, identify and learn the black keys on the keyboard.









Note that each black key has two possible names. For example, there is C sharp (C♯) and D flat (D♭). What you call this note depends on what key you are in or what chord you are playing. Here are the names of the notes on the black keys:
1st black key in the group is C♯ or D♭
2nd black key in the group is D♯ or E♭
3rd black key in the group is F♯ or G♭
4th black key in the group is G♯ or A♭
5th black key in the group is A♯ or B♭
Notice that to find the note of a black key, you either go to the white key immediately before (to the left of) it and use a sharp sign, or you go to the white key immediately after (to the right of) it and use a flat sign.

, Use the image above as a reference.









Start by finding Middle C. This note belongs in the octave 4, and is highlighted in red, above.
Go down or up to reach the octave that your key is in, decreasing or increasing the octave number respectively as you go.

, Learning what the written notes look like can also help you understand the relationship of the notes.









Here is a chart showing what the white notes look like, musically, starting at C4 (the C in the 4th octave).
Here is a chart showing what the black notes look like, musically, starting at C♯4. On the top line, the notes are written as sharps. On the bottom line notes are written as flats. Though they look different, they sound exactly the same.

2nd black key is C♯1 or D♭1.",How to Learn Keyboard Notes2," This is the lowest note playable and it is designated A0 (the A at the zeroth octave).








, The keys you'll encounter are detailed as follows:









First (left-most or lowest) white key is: A0
2nd white key is: B0
3rd white key is: C1

, Notice and repeat the following pattern for the remainder of the white keys, starting at the third white key:









3rd white key is: C1
4th white key is: D1
5th white key is: E1
6th white key is: F1
7th white key is: G1
8th white key is: A1
9th white key is: B1
10th white key is: C2
Notice how, after reaching B1, the pattern will repeat again for the next higher octave: C2. This pattern continues up the keyboard: C2 to C3, C3 to C4, and so on.

, Starting at the lowest black note on the keyboard—at the leftmost side—the first black key is A♯0 or B♭0.









The symbol ♯ is read as sharp', and the symbol ♭ is read as flat.


,
3rd black key is D♯1 or E♭1.
4th black key is F♯1 or G♭1.
5th black key is G♯1 or A♭1.
6th black key is A♯1 or B♭1.
As with the white keys, the black keys continue the same pattern up the keyboard.

Practice on your favorite musical pieces or songs at first.,
Improve your left-hand right-hand coordination skills.,
Practice performing in public.,
Make use of modern technology if you're practicing by yourself.,
Learn the fingering techniques.",How to Improve Your Piano Playing Skills," Dedicate a time slot to sessions or training and be committed about it. Try not to allow anything to deter you from your practice. Commitment to practice is crucial to improving your abilities.


Use schedules if your time is so full that you cannot dedicate the same time slot periodically.
Use reminders on any device you usually carry with you to remind you of your sessions. If using a device is not helpful, having an agenda on hand can do the same job.;
, Although this is not necessary later, at first, when you're learning new things, it's important to know what you should be learning in the next few sessions so as to be able to measure your progress. This is supposed to help you keep track of your knowledge and skills progress, not be a tool to disappoint you if you didn't make the progress you hoped for in the time you expected. If you feel some particular concept took a really long time to master, don't worry. The important thing is that, in the end, you do master it.

, Many of the steps and tips to follow will either depend on, or greatly benefit from a proficiency in reading musical notation (sheet music). You can do this as follows:


Learn to read piano music if you haven't already done so. Make sure you understand most of the concepts of musical notation. If you want to improve your overall piano playing, you'll need to learn about more advanced musical notations such as dynamics, tempo, key and time signatures, clefs, etc. Knowing only how to read the notes themselves and their intervals won't be enough.
Learn to sight-read piano music. This will improve your ability to translate what you see and understand on the musical sheet into beautiful piano tunes.

,
Learn proper piano finger placement if you haven't already done so. Placing your fingers correctly on the piano keys is crucial to developing more advanced abilities.

, Start by practicing going up the scale, then down, then up and down. Do each one at least five times using proper finger placement when practicing a certain scale.


Try to practice two or three scales before each session. Do this whether a ""session"" is a lesson with a teacher, or some free time slot you assigned to learning and practicing the piano.
Try to practice using sheet music that contains finger numbering on them, especially at first. This way you can be sure that you are playing correctly. Fingering is very important later on when you are playing harder pieces.
Practice with increasing speed. Set your metronome on a slower speed and when you have mastered one speed move it up to a faster speed. This will develop muscle memory. When learning a new song, or a new scale, start by playing it slowly but obeying the timing of the piece. Then, start speeding up, keeping proper time intervals between the notes. For example, if practicing a simple C Major scale, you'll start by playing each note (C, D, E, F, G, A, B) as a whole beat. Then start playing each note for half a beat (not leaving the other half beat as a rest), then quarter, and so on. Once you made a mistake, start all over again. Practice this for half an hour a day until you feel you can do it without making any mistake.
Practice proper chords finger placement. You can find many resources on the internet detailing proper fingering for each chord. Sometimes you'll find more than one optimal finger placement; this is a matter of preference, so follow whichever makes you more comfortable while playing (especially while progressing from one chord to the next).

, Learn all the Major, harmonic minor, melodic minor and chromatic scales. Master the scales and practice them. Also, if you're playing a specific style (such as blues, jazz, etc.), learn the scales of that style.

, Chords are multiple notes played together at the same time (on the piano, pressing multiple keys simultaneously).


Begin by learning the most prominent chords.
Learn the different inversions of a chord. Try to learn when and in what progression each inversion is used.
Practice chords by playing progressions. Start with simple ones such as the C-F-G progression. Once you've mastered those, go to more complicated ones.

, Do this as follows:


Start with simple and slow songs. Try to find the notes of the song first by trial and error on the keyboard.Always practice slowly before you try to play quicker. It is better to go step by step, rather than rushing through things.
Try to name the notes using only your ear after that, and writing them down.
After you've finished a section, try playing the notes you've written down, see how close you were.
You might create some grading system and try to test yourself. Don't worry if you get only few notes at first. Just learn from the mistakes you make. Bit by bit, you'll some day be able to write down the whole song with great accuracy.

, Mind playing is when you play a song or a piece of music in your mind. This can be done as follows:


Look at a sheet music and try to play it in your mind. At first, you'll find difficulty doing so, so play it tone by tone. At the very beginning, you might use some sort of recording device and read the notes by humming and recording. With progress, you'll start recording larger chunks of the sheet before pausing to read the next chunk. Then you'll be able to sight read whole passages, melodies, and even pieces in your mind.
After that, actually play the piece and see how close it was.

, Improper posture on the piano can cause pain which in turn makes your body more stiff so that you can't play as fluently as you would if your posture were correct.


Align your pelvis opposite to the Middle C note.
Sit upright, not leaning towards or away from the keyboard.

Be relaxed, not stiff.
Your fingers should be slightly curved downwards, as if you're holding an apple in you hand. Do not place your fingers in a perpendicular position with the keys. Also, do not allow your fingers to curve upwards.
If you're new to playing, watch the pinky fingers. They seem to go higher than the other fingers for new learners. Try to make each pinky stay at the same level as the other fingers. This might need some practice at first, but keep it up until it becomes the natural stance.

, You can find a lot of free sheet music on the internet and you can buy song books and sheet music from many music stores. You can also download free midi files of the song or piece and transform it into sheet music using certain software such as MuseScore.


Start by playing the piece really slowly. What matters at first is that you get the progression of notes and chords.
Worry about timing at the next stage. After you've mastered the progressions and development of the piece, start perfecting your timing. Make sure each note is played for the period it is meant to be played, and at the time required.
Use sectioning while learning. Learn sections of the song, master them and then move to the next section. A section can be a melody, a chord progression, a chorus or refrain, etc.

, This can be accomplished as follows:


Do some coordination exercises before you start practicing. The use of a metronome device would be good as you can practice coordination at different tempos.
When practicing more complex pieces, start by practicing the right hand part of the piece, then the left hand (or vice versa) then try to play them together. Take your time, don't rush it. Once you've mastered one part, move to the next, and not before that.

, It's important to get used to playing in public while not getting tense because of a wrong note, or nerves.


Start by performing in front of a small group of private acquaintances (family, friends, etc.).
Increase the number of attendants slowly.
Start performing in private occasions (picnics, vacations, parties, etc.)

, There is a wide range of software and hardware designed to aid in the practicing and improvement process. Some of those are:



Metronome devices. Used to practice timing and tempo and adjust your playing in accordance with time.
Software pianos. These can be useful while improving your musical aptitude and mind reading.
Musical notation software such as MuseScore. This type of software is useful for transforming midi files into sheet music. It is also useful for storing musical scores digitally, managing them, reprinting them, etc. Also, software helps with the process of composing music.
Musical software games and practice aids such as Synthesia and PrestoKeys. These games and aids are used to practice musical scores by means of a MIDI keyboard or a piano (in which case, the game won't be able to keep your score).

, Efficient fingering will help your technique so much more. Compare this to multiplication. If you were given the problem 5 plus 5 plus 5 a hundred times, would you do 5 + 5 + 5 +... or 5 * 100? Obviously the second option. Similarly, if you could use a more efficient fingering, why not use it? It takes 1 minute extra to figure out what fingering suits you best. A minute spent now could save you hours later when you try to change your fingering.


Know how the muscles in your hand work. Most of this comes from common logic. For example, you can easily point at something with your index finger. How about your ring finger (thumb = 1, index = 2, middle = 3, ring = 4, pinkie = 5) I'm not an expert in human anatomy, but it's very likely that the thumb and index finger have individual muscles, while the third, forth and fifth have muscles connected to each other. As a result, don't use excruciatingly painful fingering, such as pressing the middle C with your pinkie and then going for the E with your thumb and then the G with your ring finger.
Buy your sheet music. If you can afford sheet music, it may be in your best interests to do so. Sheet music comes with fingerings (only the ones you need to know), and people will usually have tested it before releasing it. You can photocopy books as well, but make sure you don't break any copyright laws.

"
Expose yourself to several different pianos.,
Play each of the pianos, or have the salesman play pieces as well as major and minor scales.,
Take an experienced pianist with you when you are ready to buy; get their opinion about your choice of each piano.,
Contact experts:


Find out which pianos are often used by music institutions such as conservatories and universities particularly if you can afford a very expensive piano.,
Try out several pianos of each brand.,
Inspect the piano carefully, including every part, as described.",How to Buy a Piano," Make it a point to visit a few showrooms and become familiar with various manufacturers, and the names and qualities of each make. Ask questions, and get brochures and make notations on a pad regarding each.;
, Listen carefully to hear that each piano does have a slightly different tone. Some are mellow, brilliant, loud or soft. Each individual piano produces a different tone and unique sound regardless of style. Take into consideration the size, especially if your room is small.


The grand piano ranges in size from under five feet to nine feet (a concert grand). The term ""baby grand"" is often used to describe pianos around the 5' size. A grand piano has a fast touch and is more responsive and powerful than an upright. Many people enjoy playing grand pianos more than upright pianos. However, some larger professional-quality uprights can have equal or better tone quality than many small grands. Grand pianos all have a horizontal action, and upright pianos have a vertical action that can be above or below the keys.
Uprights range in height from 36 to 51 inches (91.4 to 129.5 cm). All of them require the same amount of floor space, about five feet by two feet. The largest of the uprights is the studio piano, which is 44 inches (111.8 cm) or taller. This is a type which is becoming quite popular. Uprights, 39 to 42 inches (99.1 to 106.7 cm) tall, are referred to as consoles. No longer built is the spinet which was 36–37 inches (91.4–94.0 cm) high. Manufacturers discontinued these because they were not a great sound and the action configuration was very inferior to consoles and studios. However you might find a used spinet or one in stock that may be good for the beginner and fit nicely into the room.

, Realize however that tonal preference is very subjective and your opinion is the most important when it comes to the sound you like. Listen to low, middle, and high notes. Ask about and learn to understand what makes a certain piano more desirable than another. Keep in mind however that your ""experienced pianist"" is going to recommend what they like, not necessarily what you like. They may also want to steer you to a brand they already know. The brand you have heard of may not be the best choice. Your taste and your budget are the most important elements.

, Such hubs of music instruction know through experience some pianos which are of good quality and relatively trouble-free. Ask music professors and professional musicians for recommendations. Recognize you may be steered toward those brands who have made long term investments in marketing to these institutions to make their products most familiar.
Piano technicians are another source of information about pianos and may have thoughts on which piano to choose when you narrow down your selections. Look for a member of the Piano Technicians Guild in the yellow pages. Understand, that a technician will probably be oriented toward pianos that are easier to work on.

, Different models are typically manufactured with vast quality differences. It is similar to a car brand. The Boston piano is made from much lower quality components than a concert grand piano by Steinway even though they are sold by the same co. Often, depending on the model and price range, there are surprising individual differences. One thing you will notice is how the keys feel when you press them down. Some are stiffer than others, and some are looser. This is called touch. You will want to find the piano feels good to your fingers and and sounds good to your ears.

,
.


The Back: The posts should be heavy and strong enough to provide adequate support in proportion to the rest of the piano.
The Soundboard: A wooden board at the back of the instrument which translates the vibrations of the strings into the ""tone"" of the piano. The soundboard is one of the vital parts of the piano. A cracked soundboard can make a piano sound unappealing.
Plate: An irregularly-shaped piece of cast iron bolted to the back of the frame. It holds one end of the piano strings, and anchors most of the twenty tons of pull exerted by the taut strings.
Treble and bass bridges: Another of the piano's vital organs. These long pieces of hard maple are attached to the soundboard, transferring to it the vibrations of the strings.
When piano dealers refer to the ""strung back,"" they mean the parts just discussed plus the strings. The bass strings are wound with wire to add weight and reduce the frequency at which the string vibrates. This allows the use of relatively short strings to produce deeper notes.
The working section of the piano is called the action. There are about 7,500 parts here, all playing a role in sending the hammers against the strings when keys are struck.
Piano hammers are formed of one or two layers of felt forged onto a wooden hammer molding under tremendous pressure. If a dealer talks to you about a 9-pound hammer as opposed to a 12-pound hammer, he means the weight of the sheets of felt that were used to make the hammers.
The piano keys rest in the key bed, a perfectly flat well in the front of the cabinet that keeps the keys level. Each key is balanced by a center pin, and ""bushed"" with fine wool for silence and proper clearance. The ""ivories"" are not ivory anymore, but a fine molded plastic that won't crack or turn yellow. The black keys are made of a similar material.
Most pianos have three pedals, but most pianists need only two. The sustain pedal on the right lifts the dampers (which in a resting position prevent the strings from vibrating) away from the strings so that the tone is sustained after the keys are released.
The pedal on the left, called the soft pedal or una corda pedal mutes the tone by shortening the distance the hammers travel or by shifting the action slightly so fewer strings are hit. Many pianos have a third pedal in the middle for sustaining bass tones only. On most grand pianos and some uprights, the third pedal is the sostenuto pedal, which sustains tones when the pedal is depressed.
Finally, there's the cabinet, that handsome piece of furniture which will take a prominent place in your decor. Modern cabinets are made of core stock overlaid with thin veneers of fine furniture wood. Many grains and finishes are available and modern finishing techniques assure excellent appearance and easy care for years.

There are as many ways to improvise as there are people.",How to Improvise on the Piano1,";
, Jump in and learn one that has a lot of sharps or flats in it if you can, such as B Major. Practice the scale you learn maybe just in the right hand at first. You might find these ""bumpy"" scales are easier to play than C major, since you can ""see"" how the scale is shaped!

, It is suggested that you learn triad chords before moving on to quartals and such. Triad chords consist of three notes (1-2-3) and between two notes and the root(1-2 or 1-3) is a distinct interval. For a quick example, a C major triad consists of a C-E-G. Between C-E is a major 3rd, while between C-G the interval is a perfect fifth.

Know the names and notes of all four strings.,
Alternate your index and middle fingers to pluck the strings.,
Learn what notes each fret represents.,
Use a few tricks, like octaves, to help learn notes across the fretboard.,
Press a string right behind the fret to sound out the note.,
Fret with the outside edge of your fingertips.,
Read tablature to learn almost any song for free off the internet.",How to Play the Bass Guitar1," If you want to play the bass guitar, you need to understand how to talk about it. A bass is a relatively simple instrument, but knowing the vocabulary is essential:










Body: The big part of the bass that rests on your lap or along your stomach. It contains the hardware needed to make sound.

Neck: The long, segmented section that the strings run along.

Head: The top of the bass, where the strings are locked in. It holds the tuning pegs, which you turn to tune.

Frets: The segmented sections on the neck. Each fret represents the location of a different note.

Bridge: The area on the body that the strings are locked into. It is at the opposite end as the head.

Pick-ups: On electric basses, these are the little rectangular bars in the center of the body. They transmit the sounds you're playing to an amplifier.;
, It is easiest to play while sitting, but if you have a strap you should use it to take some of the weight off.Lay the body lightly in your lap with the neck pointing to your non-dominant hand. So, if you're right-handed, you hold the neck and frets with your left hand.









Feel free to experiment with a comfortable height. It should be roughly between your collarbones and hips, but you can adjust it within this range.
You want both arms to be loose and relaxed, elbows slightly bent.
If you're right handed, your right forearm can rest on the top of the body. Just make sure your thumb, middle finger, and index finger can comfortably reach all four strings., Of course, there are basses with five, six, or even more strings, but beginners almost always start on a 4-string bass. On guitars, the strings count upwards, meaning the first string is the closest to the ground when you're playing. The thickest string on top is the fourth string. So, looking at a guitar from the front, the strings would look like:










4th String: E

3rd String: A

2nd String: D

1st String: G

, When you alternate fingers, each only has to do half the work, meaning you can often play twice as quickly. To play a note, keep a relaxed, straight wrist, with your fingers draping down the strings. Pluck the strings with your index and middle fingers like you were ""walking"" them on the strings.









Keep your hand as still as possible.
You don't have to pull hard, just enough to sound out clearly through your amplifier.
Work on smoothly, consistently alternating fingers without any hiccups or dull notes.

, Luckily, this doesn't require memorization once you've learned how the notes work. Remember how musical notes move -- A, A♯, B, C, C♯, D, D♯, E, F, F♯, G, G♯, A. Each fret simply moves you one step down the line. So, on the 4th string, the thickest string, no fret at all is an E. The first fret is an F, the second fret an F♯, and so on down the neck.









The most important thing to remember is that there is no such thing as E♯ or B♯. You simply skip right to F and right to C.

, To help learn notes, know that any note two frets and two strings down is the same note. So, the 4th string, 3rd fret and the 2nd string, 5th fret are both Gs, though the second on is a higher pitch called an ""octave."" Octaves make learning notes much easier.









A note one string down and five frets backward is an identical note. So, the 4th string, 7th fret is an B, as is the 3rd string, 2nd fret. They should sound almost identical., If you need to play the 2nd fret, you press the string down in between the 2nd and 3rd frets. You don't need to play right on top of the fret. The closer you can get to the fret, however, the better the note will sound, so you want to be right behind the 2nd fret to get the best tone.


As you get started, you'll find it hard to always land right behind the fret. Practice a finger position that gets you a smooth note without buzzing and the speed will come later.

, Feel your fingertips, noticing the hard area right near the edge of your fingernail. This is the best place to hold the strings, just a bit to the outside of the fleshy fingertip. Because it is a bit harder of an area, you won't have to press quite so hard on the frets to get a good sound.

, This is a good way to get comfortable playing. Tablature also called ""tab"" is a simple, web-friendly way of writing out guitar and bass parts. Almost any song you could ever want to learn is available online by searching ""My Song Bass Tab."" Furthermore, learning the system is easy: each line represents a string, and the numbers on it tell you what fret to play. The following example would play the 2nd fret on the 4th string three times, then the 4th fret on the 2nd string three times:


G|-----------------------------|
D|----------------4--4--4----|
A|-----------------------------|
E|----2--2--2----------------|

Train yourself by staying on only one note.,
Work on your left hand once you're able to shred on one note.",How to Shred on a Bass," Look for strings you feel good playing on; it's important to be comfortable when you play.
, This is optional. The goal is to get a better feel on your strings. In this way, your fingers will slide with greater ease. Beware though––this is only to help you, but don't overdo it, don’t apply too much “fast fret”!



 

, If you work without it, you will practice the technique but you will not keep the rhythm. If you do practice with one, be aware that you will not be able to use it in a band or a composition., If you only play with two fingers, start playing with your third finger on a song that you already know. Don’t play a high speed rhythm at the beginning. (Don’t start with Slayer’s Raining Blood, for example.)





, Just scrape the string with the tip of your fingers to be fast enough. If you lose power in the sound, you can use a boost or distortion pedal to offset it. It is also a good way to highlight your shred when you play it in a band!, Focus on your right hand (for right-handed players). The D or G strings are the best for training., Try to change the note when you play. After that, work on your right hand by changing the string you are playing."

Tune the guitar/bass as close as you can get it.,
Starting on the bottom string, fret the 12th note.

If the sounds are not the same, adjust the length of the string in order to re-calibrate its intonation.,
Repeat this process with each string.

",How to Set the Intonation on a Guitar or Bass,";
,, If the pitch of the harmonic sounds the same as the fretted note, then that string is ok.

, The pitch generated by the harmonic is the natural pitch for reference.


If the fretted note sounds lower than the harmonic, then the length of the string should be shortened. Move the saddle towards the headstock. Try one millimetre at a time.






If the fretted note sounds higher than the harmonic, then the string should be lengthened. This is achieved by moving the saddle in the opposite direction to the headstock, one millimetre at a time.

Play along to any song by following the root notes of each chord.,
Time your notes up to the kick and snare drums.,
Learn to ""walk"" between notes.,
Practice with a metronome, as perfect timing is essential for great bassists.,
Change your picking location and style to change your sound.,
Add fills -- little improvised or creative sections -- when you're given some space.,
Service the song instead of trying to show off.",How to Play the Bass Guitar2," If you don't know the root notes or chords, just ask. For example, say the song's chords are G, C, and then D. You want to play a G when the guitarist plays a G, a C with his C, and switch to D when he switches to D. If you're just getting started, this works for more complex chords too -- you could play the same three notes if the chords were G7, C7, and D7.


For beginners, just focus on these root notes. As you get better, start experimenting with the same notes in other areas. The open 2nd string is a D, but so is the 3rd string, 5th fret!
Work on transitioning right in time with the guitarist. You want to hit the first C note right as she hits the first C chord.

, One of the bass's primary functions is to bridge the gap between the rhythm section (drums) and the other melody instruments (guitar, vocals, piano, etc.) To do so, you have to be locked into both, playing the right root notes to fit the melody and the right rhythm to fit the drums. Good ways to do this are to think in frequencies:


Play a lower note to time up with the low-frequency kick drum, hitting this deep bass not together.
Play a higher note (like the same note's octave) to fit in with the snare drum., The walking bassline began in blues and jazz but has since expanded to all types and genres of music. It is the simplest way to bridge your root notes and start expanding your playing through songs. To begin doing so, simply try playing each fret between two notes on the same string. For example, say the song goes from an E to an A. The following ""walk"" helps you fill the space between changing chords:


G|-----------------------------|
D|-----------------------------|
A|-----------------------------|
E|----0--1--2--3--4--5-----|
You'll notice that some notes don't sound as good as others. As you get better, you'll learn to walk up and down using only the notes in your scales.


, You want to play limited notes, but you want every single note to hit the listener hard. The only way to do this is to keep a strong, regular rhythm, which makes practicing with a metronome essential. You should always focus on landing on the beats, practicing in 4/4, 8/8, and even 3/2 with your metronome.


Rock bassists tend to create a rocking, bouncing feel by landing hard on the 2nd and 4th beats.
Funk bassists must hit the 1st and 3rd beats harder than the other two -- this is one of the roots of the genre.
Reggae and ska bass tend to focus on the in-between beats -- the ""1 and, 2 and, 3..."" beats.

, Plucking the guitar near the neck produces a warmer sound. Plucking near the bridge has a brighter and more percussive tone. And switching to a pick gives you a harder, sharper edge to your notes. If you're really looking to extend your range, you can learn to play slap bass, producing the unique, loud tones made famous in the Seinfeld soundtrack.


The aggressiveness you pluck with will also dramatically change the sound.
Palm muting is when you drape the edge of your hand on the bridge while picking, giving a quiet, percussive, and plodding sound to your notes.
Always think about what tone best fits the song. Harder, more rocking genres like punk tend to want louder, more percussive playing, while softer tones are used in a variety of genres., When you want to add a little flourish or flair, pick moments where the band gives you space -- when there are no vocals, during moments the lead guitarist is quiet, or in and out of transitions. Fills are your chance to show off for a few notes, and they are an essential part of keeping the bass interesting without stepping on anyone's toes.


When playing a fill, try to time it up with a drummer's fill. This usually comes right before the song transitions in some way.
Remember that the roots notes are always most important. When in doubt, play the root notes.

, Great bass players know that they are responsible for a song's groove-- the almost subconscious feel that gets people dancing or moving. But a busy, technical, or flashy bassline is very hard to groove to and often drowns out guitar, piano, and vocal parts. A huge part of successful bass playing is showing restraint.


Remember -- root notes come first, forming the melodic backbone of the song. Any flourishes must come after you've mastered these notes."
"
Learn the major scale to greatly increase your note range when playing.,
Master the minor scale for a slightly more moody set of notes.,
Learn how the major and minor scales are combined to play even further down the neck.,
Play the other notes of chords instead of just the roots.,
Use accenting techniques to make each note stand out.,
Prioritize the 5th note of each scale when making transitions.,
Mute unneeded strings with your other fingers as you play.,
Study music theory.",How to Play the Bass Guitar3," You must, at a minimum, learn the major and minor scales. These two scales, played across the guitar, can guide you throw 90% of the songs thrown your way. If a song is in the key of C-major, you have the entire C-major scale at your disposal. The following scale is for A-major, but you simply start it on whatever note you want to put it in the key of this note. Bolded notes are the roots, or the two A notes.


G|-----5----6---7---|
D|-----5----6---7---|
A|--4--5--------7---|
E|------5--------7---|, The minor scale generally has a ""darker"" or more ""moody tone to it. The A-minor scale located below is a good fit for songs in A-minor. Again, bolded notes indicate root notes.


G|--4--5-------7------|
D|------5-------7------|
A|------5-------7--8--|
E|------5-------7--8--|, This handy trick will double the number of notes at your disposal when playing songs, though it is important to note that they still have different feels. To find the notes, take the major scale in the key you're playing, for example, the A major shown above. If you start a minor scale on the second note of the major scale, in this case the 7th fret B, all of these notes will fit in your song as well!


Otherwise put, a song in A-major can use either the A-major scale or the B-minor scale.
This relationship holds up and down the fretboard.

, For example, you could play just A, E, and D if the chords are A7, E7, and D7. But you could also play some of those 7th notes, which simply mean the 7th note in the associated scale. So, if the guitarist is playing an A7, you can also hit the 7th not in the A-major scale (2nd string, 6th fret) to sound amazing.


If you're struggling with the numbers, just ask the guitarist to show you the chord. All the notes he's playing on his top four strings will match the notes on your four strings., Many bassists can play 10 notes and sound good, but only the best players can play one note and make it sound amazing. Bass is a very physical instrument, and your ability to handle and manipulate the strings is how you wring emotion and power out of every note:



Vibrato: Keeping your finger on the string, shake your hand up and down. You should hear the note ""waving"" based on how high or far you shake the string.

Bends: With your finger on the fret, use 2-3 fingers to push the string up the neck. You should hear the note's pitch change as you bend the string. You can also pull the string downward, too.

Slides: Play a note and, without taking your hand off the string, slide down to the next note you want to play, fluidly transitioning down.

Hammer-Ons: Instead of plucking a note, slam your finger down on the string at the fret you want, sounding it out with just this hand.

Pull-Offs: When removing your finger from a fret, use your fretting hand to pluck the string instead of coming straight off., If you stick to root notes, their octaves, and the 5th, you can create many interesting, melodic, and moving basslines. The 5th is simply the 5th note in the scale -- even if that particular chord isn't being used. You can slide the 5th note between other roots to effortlessly slid up and down the neck. Check the lick below, played over a simple C, G, D chord progression illustrated below.


G|------------5---------------------------------------------------------------|
D|---------5-----5--------------------------5--------------------------------|
A|----3--------------0--3--0---2-------5-----5-----------------------------|
E|---------------------------------------------------3----------3/10----10--|
|-C-Major-|-----------------|-G-Major-|--------------------|-D-Major-|

, The bass is a very low, deep frequency, and you'll notice that it shakes the room when played loud. This is great, except when that shaking sounds out the strings you aren't even playing! To avoid this, bass players must use their whole hand to keep other strings mute, which you can do by simply laying a finger on the string to keep it still:


When you play a note, let your finger come up, resting on the string above it to mute it. Don't pull your hand away from the guitar after plucking. Do the same thing when plucking your thumb downward, resting it on the string below.
Use your ring and pinky fingers to mute lower strings, resting them on all strings below the two plucking fingers.
Use your thumb to mute higher strings, resting it on strings above the ones you're playing., There are endless options available to you, from new scales to modes and melodic tricks, that only come from time spent learning music theory. Start with the basics, like the circle of fifths, before moving on to scale composition and more fun tricks and tips.


At the very least, learn how to form the pentatonic scales, which are simplified versions of your major and minor scales.

Let your guitar rest.",How to Set Up a Bass Guitar," This is the top of the guitar, where the strings are held on to the nuts for tuning. Note how the strings come off at the nut and wind around each tuner, especially how many times each wraps around. Lower strings, which are thicker, will wrap around fewer times. This is a good reference point for when you re-string the bass yourself to see if things are fitting properly., To do this, loosen the first string via the tuning pegs, until you see it loosen. Where the bass is strung at the bottom of the guitar will be different for different depending on the manufacturer. You may have to pull the string out through the bridge, or the body.Before removing the strings, be sure to see how they are wrapped around each post. Wrapping around the wrong side is a common mistake, so make a note of which way to go for when you re-string.
You can either replace the strings one at a time or all together. Most people prefer to change them one by one because it keeps some tension on the neck. If you do them all at once, just keep track of which string went with each nob so you replace them in the proper order.
Once you've removed the strings, it's good to keep them as spares in case your new ones break., Use cleaning oil to give the neck a good wipe down and get rid of any dirt or grime. If the neck is made of wood, check your cleaning product to make sure it won't damage the wood. Then apply some oil to the fretboard and let it soak for about 5 to 10 minutes in before wiping off the excess., Use a soft cloth to wipe down the rest of the bass, getting rid of dust and any stray fingerprints. Do this without the strings is better because you'll be able to get to the parts of the bass that would normally be covered by them. You can use a cotton swab to really get into the nooks on the bridge., Make sure the thickness matches the string you pulled out of that slot. The order you string the guitar doesn't really matter, though it is easier to start on one end and go down the line in order. It's most important that you get the right string thicknesses in the right place on your bass.When you start the restringing, make sure to give yourself too much string to thread through and wrap at the nut in the headstock. You'll always be able to cut off extra.

, Bend the string down into the nut, and wrap while turning the tuner. Hold the string taut with one hand and make sure to wrap as tightly as possible around the nut. Make sure that you're being careful not to damage the string. Finely wound or strings with coatings can be nicked and bent very easily., You should now be turning the attached tuner knob to tighten up the string. You don't need to get the string in perfect pitch just yet but it's a good idea to keep tightening the string until it makes a sound when you pluck it. In other words, keep tightening the string until it no longer flops around the fret board on the neck. You'll adjust the tuning later, for now the string just needs to be tight., If you decided to remove them all at once, you'll only need to do the re-stringing, but if not, you'll just start by loosening the next one and going on from there.

, Once you have completely re-strung the bass, you can tune the strings to get the proper notes. Use an electric tuner, or a piano, to get the proper pitches. The strings on a four-string bass should be tuned (low to high) at the notes E-A-D-G, while a five-string should be B-E-A-D-G., In most basses, the truss rod is located at the bottom of the headstock. Some bass guitars, though, will have the truss rod hidden at the bottom portion of the fret board where the neck joins the body.


If the truss rod is in the headstock, you should be able to make adjustments with a 5mm Allen wrench, which should be included with your bass. If it does not have one, you should be able to get one from a tool kit.If your truss rod has a cover on it, it'll need to be removed. You will see a metal plate screwed into the back of the bass where the neck joins the body. This can be removed by simply unscrewing the screws that are fixing it to the guitar. Remember to keep the truss rod cover and its screws in a safe place. These truss rods can be adjusted using a Phillips screwdriver., A good rule of thumb is the thickness of one to two business cards between the string and the frets. More experienced bassists will probably have a more specific gap in mind, and can adjust to that. Frets are the ridges on the neck that you press the strings onto to create different notes. Slide the business card between the string and the 8th fret (starting your count from the headstock). If the card can't fit, you'll need to loosen the truss, and if there is extra space, you'll have to tighten it., In most basses, you will turn the rod clockwise to tighten the truss rod, and counterclockwise to loosen it. You shouldn't need to turn it much, about 1/4 turn in the necessary direction.Clockwise and counterclockwise directions based on looking down the neck from the headstock., Once you have made the turn, check the gap with your business cards at the 8th fret again. Avoid adjusting more than 2 or 3 times in total. If you still aren't satisfied with the adjustment, or notice you can't turn the rod any further, take it to a professional technician to let them examine it., Once you have finished setting the truss, retune the strings and let your guitar sit for a few hours. You want to let the wood settle after the adjustments. After the rest, pick it up and give it a try. If everything feels right, you are ready to go."

Choose the number of strings.,
Select a scale.,
Decide on fretted or fretless.,
Choose a material.,
Find an amp.,
Decide if you'll play with your fingers or with a pick.",How to Play Bass1," Because bass guitars are electric, the body of the guitar can come in nearly any shape or color and still give a great sound. What is important though, is choosing a guitar with the right number of strings for your ability. As a beginner, it is best to start with a classic 4-string bass guitar.


The original bass guitar was made with 4 strings, and is considered the most basic. Nearly all bass guitar music can be played on a 4-string guitar, and because the neck is narrower than a 5 or 6 string guitar, it is easier to work your hands around.
A 4-string guitar is typically strung with the EADG strings, but if you want, it can be strung like a 5-string guitar with a lower string making it BEAD instead.
5-string and 6-string guitars are great because they give a greater range of available notes to play. However, they also require more control to reduce the buzzing of other strings and the ability to reach all the notes.;
, The scale of a bass guitar refers to the distance from the nut to the bridge, essentially the length of the guitar strings. A longer scale will have longer string length and produce a deeper sound. A shorter scale may be easier to maneuver for a beginner, but will lack the depth of sound a long scale bass will have.


Most bass guitars have a 34” scale, but you can also find short scale (30” or less), medium scale (30”-33:), and extra long scale (35” or more) bass guitars.
Unless your hands are very small or very large, stick with a 34” scale for the best sound.
If you decide to get a 5-string or 6-string bass guitar, increase the scale for a better sound. Always get a minimum 35” scale if you increase the number of strings., A fret is the space sectioned by small metal dividers on the fingerboard of the guitar. Frets mark where different notes on a string can be played, and are found on all guitars. However if you are buying a bass guitar, you have the option to go fretless.


A fretless guitar does not have the metal dividers, and instead has a long, smooth fingerboard.
Fretless guitars are more difficult to play because you don’t have a visual marker of where certain notes lie. Instead, you have to play the bass by ear.
For beginners, it is best to choose a guitar that is fretted, to give some guidelines for note and finger placements. Over time, you can choose to move to a fretless guitar for a bigger challenge and a slightly different sound., Bass guitars are made out of many different materials, including different types of hard and soft woods, and composite or synthetic materials. Each substance gives the bass a slightly different appearance and sound.


Hard woods, such as hard maple, walnut, ebony, and rosewood, give a percussive sound to your bass.
Soft woods including alder, basswood, and swamp ash, aid in supplying your bass with a softer, warm sound.
The most popular synthetic material to make bass guitars out of is graphite, although luthite is another commonly used material. These are all very consistent in sound, as the material doesn’t change from guitar to guitar like it does with natural woods.
Many bass guitars are made from a mix of materials, especially having the body of one material and the fingerboard of another. This is a good option as well, so don’t feel the need to search for a single-material bass only., In order to play bass, you need to have an amp to attach it to so you can hear yourself play. An amp has three parts: the power amp, preamp, and speaker cabinet. The easiest way to get all three is to buy a combo amp. Although these may lack the louder sound of bigger amps or separate parts, they are the easiest for beginners to use., many people recommend you to learn both ways, you'll be a more versatile bassist.

Make sure the power amp and all effects are turned off.,
Disconnect all power adapters from the power amp and the effects pedals.,
Make sure there are no instrument and/or speaker cables attached to either the power amplifier or any effects pedal.

,
Connect the power supply to the power amplifier (speaker cabinets do not require a power supply).

,
Turn on the equipment.,
Turn off the equipment.",How to Set up the Essential Effects Chain (Guitar/Bass)," Some higher-end amplifiers feature what is called an “effects loop”. Typically located on the back of any power amp, the effects loop consists of an input known as the FX Return and an output known as the FX Send.

The FX Return is connected to the output of an effects pedal, while the FX Send is connected to the input of an effects pedal.
The FX loop allows the guitarist to place certain effects after the distortion generated by the amplifier's distortion channel (if applicable). The term “in front” refers anything plugged into the main input of the amp, which in this case would exclude anything plugged into the FX loop.
While sonic beauty is in the ear of the listener, the FX loop is typically used to house delay, reverb, tremolo, and chorus pedals. The reasoning behind this is that delay, reverb etc tend to sound better after distortion (echoing a distorted sound, rather than being distorted). If your amplifier has a distortion channel (which you plan on using), the effects loop will let you run delay, reverb etc after the distortion stage.
If you only use effects pedal distortion, simply placing the delay/reverb after that pedal will achieve the same result. With all this in mind, this guide will set up the delay pedal in the FX loop, while the other effects will go “in front” of the amp.



 

;
, Make certain the amp does not have a “stand-by” switch engaged! If this switch is on, turn it off first, then proceed to shut the amp down.

, If you are using a tube amp, wait about a half hour after turning it off before disconnecting the power source. This allows the tubes to “cool down” properly.

,,, The input is on the right side of the Dunlop Wah-Wah pedal.

, The output of the Dunlop Wah-Wah pedal is located on the left side of the pedal, while the input of the Boss DS-1 distortion pedal is located on the right side of the pedal.

, The output of the Korg AX100G effects processor is located on the left side of the processor, while the power amp input is located either on top of the unit, or on the “face” of the unit (the input is almost always located near the amp’s tone controls).

,

Using an instrument cable, connect the input of the Boss DD-6 delay pedal into the FX Send output of the FX loop. The input of the Boss DD-6 delay pedal is located on the right side of the pedal.






Using an instrument cable, connect the output of the Boss DD-6 delay pedal into the FX Return input of the FX loop. The output of the Boss DD-6 delay pedal is located on the left side of the pedal.







,


Each of the 4 effects pedals has an input for a power supply (usually located on the rear of the pedal). It is very important you use the correct power supply for each pedal (for the DS-1 and Crybaby a Boss PSA-230P DC adapter will work fine). Most effects pedals use regulated 9 volts DC, with a center negative plug (make sure the symbols on the adapter and pedal matches). Other pedals have other requirements. Smaller/simpler pedals (like the DS-1 and Crybaby) can often share the same power supply - assuming their power requirements match up. Bigger things - delay pedals, multi-effects etc - may require their own separate adapter. In any case, never plug in a power supply if you aren't 100% sure it is the correct one!

, Because DC adapters take up a lot of outlets, it would be beneficial to use a power strip to connect all adapters to one electrical outlet.

,


If you are not using the recommended “half stack” combination (consisting of a power amplifier and a speaker cabinet), skip to step 16.
Locate the speaker output of the power amp and make note of its impedance level(s). For guitar amps, the OHM level is usually 4, 8, or 16 OHMs, while bass amps usually feature a 2 OHM level. If one output features a “dual impedance” level (ex: 4/8 or 8/16), this means it can connect to a speaker cabinet that accepts either of the impedance levels listed.

,,,,

Turn the amplifier on, being sure to disengage a “stand-by” switch if present.






Turn on all the effects pedals, making sure that a light or some other LED display turns on along with each device.






Using either a switch or rotary control, engage the FX loop.






Make sure your guitar’s volume is turned up, and you’re ready to go!







,


##Turn off the power amplifier before anything else. Wait about thirty seconds to make sure the amp is completely shut down.
Turn off all the effects pedals.
Disconnect the power supplies from each of the effects pedals. This keeps the adapters from “running hot”, as effects pedals still use electricity even if they are set to the “bypass” setting (“bypass” refers to the setting in which an effect is used in an effects chain, but is not activated. For example, there may be four effects in the effects chain, but only two are activated during a particular song).

Practice on a regular basis.",How to Play Bass2," In order to make the best music you can, it is important to have it in the proper position. You should always use a shoulder strap to hold the bass so that when you are playing your hands can focus on make the sounds you want to hear.


You can sit or stand up, but make sure that you have good posture in either position. Also, make sure that the shoulder strap holds your bass at the same level regardless of whether you are sitting or standing.
The bass should be held somewhere between your hips and collarbones. Most people tend to play with it held near their bellybutton, but it’s all personal preference.
The guitar should be held at about a 30 degree angle, so as to prevent the need to uncomfortably angle your wrists so much., The standard tuning on a 4-string bass guitar is E-A-D-G, with E being the low string and G being the high string. You can learn how to tune your guitar by ear, which is often inexact, or plug your bass into an electric tuner, which is more exact. To make a string go up or go down in pitch, turn the tuning heads, also called tuning machines.

, The bass guitar, unlike other guitars, is only ever plucked rather than strummed. It is important to maintain good plucking practices though, to create the best sounding music. The bass can be picked like a guitar as well, which is a matter of musical preferences.


Always keep your nails trimmed short. Your nails will change the sound of the guitar if used against the strings.
Pluck using two fingers to increase efficiency. Alternate plucking between your index and middle finger. It doesn’t matter which you start with, as long as you keep the speed and rhythm between them consistent.
Pluck the strings closer to the neck for a flat, warm tone. If you pluck nearer to the bridge at the bottom, the strings will give a more percussive sound. When you practice, keep your plucking isolated to a small area without a lot of movement up and down the strings.
Pluck the strings by rolling over them with your fingertips. Don’t actually pull on the strings, as they won’t create as nice of a sound. If you want to increase the volume, turn up your amplifier, not your plucking strength.

, In order to give a clear sound and avoid muffling the notes you play, it is necessary to mute the strings by resting a finger on them.


Keep your thumb as close to the E string as you are able, so that whenever you are not playing it your thumb can rest on it to do the muting.
If you have to skip strings to play multiple notes, try using multiple fingers to help with muting.
You can choose to move your thumb off the E string to mute other strings if you are playing higher strings.
Don’t push down hard on the strings, but gently rest your finger or thumb on them to block the vibrations that cause sound., Roots are the main note that a chord is based off of. A chord is playing multiple strings at once, and the root is the note for which the chord is named. Typically, you will start playing the base simply by focusing on playing the roots to chords.

, All music is made up of 12 notes, which can be played in higher or lower versions. The higher or lower version of a single note is called an octave.


To play a higher-pitched octave than the note you are currently playing, move two strings up and two frets up.
To play a lower-pitched octave than the note you are currently playing, move two strings down and two frets down.
You can play a lower octave with your index finger and the corresponding higher octave with your ring finger. Use your other fingers to help mute the strings that are not being played., Once you understand roots, learn how to play fifths as well. A fifth is the note you play five scale tones away from the root. Typically these are played together, to accompany another player on the guitar or piano. Fortunately, finding your fifths is pretty simple.


To play a fifth above, move two frets higher on the next string.
To play a fifth below, stay on the same fret and move to one string lower., The most important job of a good bass player is to keep the rhythm of their music. The bass definitely adds great sound to any piece of music, but the vital task is keeping a good beat. Once you get better at plucking and playing the correct notes, spend time working on keeping rhythm.


Listen to the bass performances in some of your favorite songs to hear the ways that they keep rhythm.
Buy a metronome to help you practice. Metronomes are small tools that emit a clicking noise at a certain rate, helping you to match the rhythm. You can adjust their speed to practice at a fast or slow pace., The best advice for anyone learning a new instrument is to practice regularly. Putting in only a few minutes of work each week will make excelling difficult. Giving yourself at least 10-20 minutes of practice a day will not only help your hands to feel comfortable with the bass, but make your music sound clearer and better over time.

Learn some advanced techniques when you feel you are ready.,
When you feel the need of having two or more basses, go for it!",How to Play Bass3," Tablature is a visual guide that will teach you how to play notes of songs if you don't know how to read music. Since many people don't know how to read music, tablature is becoming increasingly popular.

, As boring as they sound, scales are actually very important in the development of serious musicians. Learning scales will help you practice your fingering, improve your speed and agility, as well as help you to solo/improvise.

, A solo is when a musician sets off on their own and plays a musical passage that's distinct, varied, and sometimes improvised. Soloing can be hard, but it's also rewarding.

, When you get to the point of starting to be bored playing other people's music, it may be time to create your own. Composing your own music takes a lot of time, practice, and false starts, but having your own song is like nothing else in the world.

, Some of these techniques include sweep picking (with fingers or with a pick, it's harder with fingers), tapping, tremolo picking (again, harder with hands than with a pick) and slapping/popping.

, If you are at this point, it means that you really like what you are doing. You may be bored with always tuning and detuning your bass, so having 2 or three can save you some time.

Consider a DI box.,
Consider going direct.,

Link your instrument to your Macbook.,
Use GarageBand's digital amps.,
Plug in headphones.,
Switch your input from Microphone to Line In.,
Open GarageBand and record.,
Restore your settings to normal when finished.",How to Connect a Guitar or Bass Guitar to a Macbook1," You'll need some kind of interface or adapter that takes the signal from the guitar and gets it to the computer.A DI is a small amplifier which takes the (quiet) signal coming from your instrument and amplifies it before it goes into your Macbook. DIs come in either active or passive forms. Most six string guitars are passive by design (no amplification inside the instrument itself requiring a battery) and thus will require an active DI. Some bass guitars are active by design (require a battery in the instrument) and could use a passive DI, but in general active DIs are more common.Although DIs convert instrument signal effectively, they are most commonly used alongside professional recording equipment and thus may not have the appropriate outputs to get into your Macbook. Since you want to avoid adapting your connections / signal multiple times, make sure to find a DI that has the output you want.
Search for an ""interface"". The term interface is often used for more complex options of connecting instruments to computers, and implies a more automatic compatibility with modern laptops via USB or other means. Search ""guitar macbook interface"" or similar to see some options. These work very similarly to DIs by amplifying the signal on its way to the laptop, but are sometimes sold in conjunction with software suites that help model various classic amplifiers and effects once your signal has made the leap to digital.;
, First understand what you have in terms of connections one each side (1/4 inch cable / thunderbolt input, etc...) then consider what exactly you're trying to achieve. Choosing to connect your cables with adapters only (and not use DI or other proper signal converter) when recording results in signal loss and unwanted noise.Note: Older versions of Macbook had a ""microphone"" 1/8inch input, while newer versions do not.

, This is the perfect time for you to check if your guitar is in tune. You don't need an amp cranked to full volume to do this. At a reasonable volume or without amplification at all, listen to the intervals of your instrument or use a tuner to tune it.


If you plan on using a tuner or foot pedal with your instrument, these will also need to be added to your setup. For most basses, this means you will have to connect the foot pedal and tuner to your guitar with correct accompanying attachments before you attach your DI.
If you are recording, you may also want to consider using some fretboard lubricant. This will decrease the amount of squeaking caused by sliding your fingers down the strings., Doing this depends on your chosen Di/interface. If you choose to adapt your chord and connect your guitar directly to your Macbook, you'll need appropriate adapters and can expect significant signal loss..


More recent Macbook versions do not have an audio input for a direct connection but older models do.
Be careful when you're connecting your cable to your Macbook's audio input! This port can look very similar to your headphone input. In most cases, your headphone input will be indicated by a small headphone or musical note symbol beside the port., This can be an effective space saving technique, since traditional amps can take up a significant amount of space. GarageBand comes pre-loaded with many common amps that you can use to craft the sound of your guitar. Choose from one of these for the amp that best suits your purposes.


You'll have to experiment with GarageBand to find which amp produces the kind of sound suited for your recording. You can also customize amp pre-sets through the amp pop-up menus. Using these, you can change between amp types, models, cabinets, and mics., Though it can feel righteous tearing a solo on your bass at loud volumes, with this kind of setup the extra noise will likely create feedback and distort the sound of your instrument when recording. Protect the quality of your recordings by using headphones.


Even if you don't intend on using your headphones and instead plan on using the readout in your digital audio interface (DAW), which in this case is GarageBand, plugging in headphones can still improve the quality of your recording.
A Feedback Protection feature can be enabled in GarageBand from the monitor pop up menu. Toggle this feature ""On"" in that menu to protect yourself from excess feedback., This can be found in your System Preferences, which can be found on the program dock. You dock is usually located at the bottom of your screen, and System Preferences will likely be represented by a gear icon. In System Preferences, there should be an option labeled ""Sound."" Open this by clicking and then choose ""Input"" in the following menu. Here you will be able to change the settings from Internal Microphone to Line In., Navigate to GarageBand on your Macbook. When the program launches, in the upper left hand corner should be the ""File"" heading. Select this and, in the resulting menu, choose ""New"" or ""New Project."" This will open the New Project dialogue box. Here you can choose from many different inputs for your recording; choose the setting that best matches your recording preferences.


Once you have opened a New Project and the associated dialogue box has appeared, options should be available for digital amp users who are not using an external amp.

Set your price range.,
Shop around.,

Bring someone along who is an experienced bassist.,
Consider buying a used bass.",How to Buy Your First Bass Guitar on a Budget," A new bass guitar can cost anywhere from $200 to $5000 depending on the brand, quality, and finish. Used basses tend to range from $100 to $1500 and are often just as good, although pricing and selection will vary from one locale to another.;
, Over the last year or two, some department stores (such as Target and Walmart) began carrying ""starter"" instruments that are far less expensive than you might find in a guitar shop. For example, a starter bass currently listed at Target.com is priced at $129. However, your best bet is to check guitar shops and pawn shops frequently for a good deal. Also, check the classified ads. Most people have no idea what they are selling, and you can get a good deal.

, Most guitar shops will let you plug in and play around with any instrument right in the store. See if you like how it sounds, looks, and feels in your hands. Do not buy something used without playing it first unless it comes from a reputable dealer and has some sort of return policy if it turns out you do not like it. Be very cautious about buying instruments on internet sites such as eBay. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

, Let him/her play any instruments you are considering buying. If you are a parent buying an instrument for your son or daughter, find someone who can try instruments for you. Your child will thank you later.

, Most used equipment drops in price over the years and can offer much better quality and sound for the same price as a new bass. Always check a used instrument for damage, and play it (or have someone else play it) before buying it. If you are buying remotely and you cannot have physical access to it, use your judgment and make sure you can have it returned.

Resolve dead audio output created by Mono Audio.,
Check muting, soloed, and instrument tracks for other audio issues.,
Check manuals for incompatibility.",How to Connect a Guitar or Bass Guitar to a Macbook2," In some cases when using a physical amp, you might find that GarageBand does not recognize any sound being produced, even when you are playing your instrument. This may be caused by a settings conflict. The most likely issue will be with your Mono Audio setting. To fix this, you should:


Navigate on your Macbook from Settings → General → Accessibility. In the resulting menu, you should see a Mono option, which you should turn off. After adjusting this setting, your sound production should be A-OK.
You may need to close GarageBand and re-launch the program for your setting changes to take effect., If you have muted your main instrument or soloed another instrument, GarageBand will not output the sound from your instrument. Additionally, if you have changed your instrument track from blue to green, GarageBand is programmed to ignore your input instrument.You may have activated one of these features through an accidental click or by hitting a hotkey mistakenly. Check each of these simple solutions before attempting something more drastic.

, There is a huge variety of equipment you might be using when producing and recording sound with your Macbook. Any one of these pieces of equipment, your tuner, your DI, your pre-amp, and many other commonly used guitar accessories, can create difficulty with GarageBand if the equipment is not compatible with Apple products. Check the manuals for your equipment to see if there are compatibility issues.


If you've bought your equipment used and were never given a manual, or if you have lost your manual, you can usually search the make and model of your equipment to find its specifications. In many cases, you might even have a digital copy of the manual available to you."

Finding the harmonic!,
Lightly place your finger overtop the fret, just enough to make contact with the string.,
Pluck the string with your picking hand, using your thumb or plectrum/pick.,
Practice a quick release.",How to Play Harmonics on the Bass Guitar1," The frets seven and twelve tend to be the frets most easily used with this technique, so we will start there. Choose either.;
, Note that you are in fact over the fret itself and note placing your finger where you would hold the string down as if normally fretting it.

, Adjust your fret hands pressure and placement until you have a satisfying harmonic note.

, Now that you have found the placement that gives you the strongest and clearest harmonic over the fret, practice releasing your finger from the string as quickly as possible after picking it to let the harmonic ring out. You're done!

"
"
Hold down the first fret.,
Find the thirteenth fret.,
Using either your picking hand's first, second, or third finger, pluck the string while your thumb  stays stationary.,
Practice the release.",How to Play Harmonics on the Bass Guitar2," This method involves holding down the strings in the usual manner and focus is on the picking hand. For ease of learning holding down the first fret of whichever string you choose will be the starting point.

, Previously the twelfth fret would produce the desired harmonic but due to the first fret being held down, it will now reside at the thirteenth. Place your picking hands thumb overtop the fret using the same basic rules from the previous method.

, Adjust your thumbs placement if needed.

, As in the previous method, once the desired harmonic is found practice releasing your finger after the string is plucked to allow it to ring out.

Make sure you are serious about becoming a bass player, most people think that it is very easy and doesn't take any skill.,
Purchase a bass guitar and a bass amplifier.,
Learn how to play!,
Join/start a band!,
This is it, time to establish your style.,
Succeed!",How to Establish Yourself As a Bass Player," This is not true by any means. Playing bass takes a lot of rhythm and coordination. If you do not have either, practice up on them before taking action for the next step.;
, This is a fairly easy one, assuming financial limitations are few. Buy a bass under $500, but more than $200, since these are generally very good quality instruments, but not too fancy or elaborate. As far as amps go, get one about 50w for starting. 50 watts is enough to feel the bass and hear it over a drummer, considering you are playing with one. Upgrade both your bass and amplifier after about a year of heavy use.

, This step is the most important of them all. If you don't know how to play, and play well, you never can have the chance for people to like you and your style! So you can either do what i did, teach yourself for about a year and then start lessons, or just take lessons right off the bat. Do not teach yourself without taking lessons at all along the way, only because i feel that associating with one who knows more about the instrument than you can truly help you succeed.

, What good is a bass player without a band backing him or her up? join up with some people who share interests in the same kind of music as you, and learn to cover some of your favorite songs. This will help you in the future if you start writing original material. Make sure your new band practices often.

, Don't just rip off some other Bass player's style. First thing in establishing your style is to find out your method of playing your bass guitar. Do you play with your finger, with a pick, or do you slap? Make sure you have your style down-pat and then move on to deciding your image. What matters is the player and how well they perform. If you wish to establish your look, by all means, do it! Are you going to take the Flea approach? The ""Krist N style""? Les Claypool-esque? Do whatever feels and looks the most natural for you. Don't try to be something you're not either, you don't want to be a poser.

, Book some gigs and rock your heart out! Figure out your stage presence and always be in this presence at shows! get people excited! land a record deal! BE BIG! just remember, stay true to the music. it's the best thing to ever happen to you, take my word for it.

Examine the head of your guitar.,
Loosen the first string via the tuner until the wraps on the winder begin to visibly relax.,
Once the string is loose enough, pull it from the tuner.,
Pull the string out either through the bridge or the body, depending on your particular bass.,
Clean the revealed portion of your bass guitar neck with a soft cloth or towel.,
Note if the old string had the correct number of winds around the tuner, use it as a template for cutting the new string of the same gauge to length.,
Pull the new string of the same gauge through your bridge assembly in the exact manner you removed it.,
Thread the string through and around guides, if any, being careful not to damage the string.,
Pull the string taut, tighter if you want but tension is not necessary here.,
Examine the wraps on the tuner; they should not be overlapping, but lay side-by-side nicely.,

Tune your bass guitar and play!








",How to Change Strings on a Bass Guitar," Note how the strings come off the grooves in the nut at the top of the neck, pass or bypass holders and the direction that they wrap around the tuners. This is very important for tone. You should have no less than 2 wraps around each tuner but no more than can fit around the tuner without overlapping.






;
, You can either take all the strings off at once and put new ones in all together, or do them one at a time. Some people prefer to change them one by one because it prevents changes in stresses on the neck. Others will periodically remove all the strings at once so they can clean the fretboard more easily. But that's your choice.








, It will be bent on the end where it was stuck into the tuner.








, Sometimes it will be difficult to grasp the end of the string to pull it out, so alternatively begin by pushing the string out then pulling.








, There are MANY treatments available to clean your guitar with, pick whichever is your favorite.








, If not, it still can be used to guide you in cutting the length of the new string.








, Be careful not to damage the guitar finish. Pull the string completely through the bridge before laying it on the nut.








, Finely wound or strings with coatings can be nicked or bent easier than one might think.








, Wrap it around the tuner until there is about an inch left.








, Correct it if necessary.








, Make sure not to put the tip in before wrapping if possible, since doing this will twist the string and can lower its integrity and sound quality.








, There should be at least two complete wraps present on the tuner, but still no more than can fit on without overlapping. The new string should sit on the bass just as the old one did.

Test your action adjustments by playing your bass at each fret.",How to Adjust Action on a Bass," Use an electronic tuner to achieve accurate tuning. This will assure that the strings are at the proper tension when adjusting the action.;
,


It takes time for the neck of a bass to settle into its final position after significant changes have been made to the forces applied to it.
Waiting longer periods will increase the accuracy of your adjustments.

,


The neck of your bass must have a slight bow to play properly. If the neck were straight, you would get fret buzz, especially on notes played on the first 5 frets.
If you have a capo, attach it at the first fret; otherwise, hold down the E-string (or B-string on a 5-string bass) at the 1st fret with your left index finger. Hold the string down at the 12th fret with your right thumb or right elbow. Use a feeler gauge to determine the largest gap between the string and the tops of the 4th through 8th frets. If the string is touching any of these frets, the neck needs more relief. If the gap between the string and any of these frets is greater than 0.020 inch (0.5 mm), then the neck needs less relief.
Alternatively, attach a capo at the first fret or hold down the G-string at the 1st fret with your left index finger. Press the G-string down at the end of the neck with your elbow. Use a feeler gauge to measure the gap between the bottom of the string and the top of the 8th fret. If the gap exceeds 0.012 inch (0.3 mm), the neck needs less relief. If there is no gap, the neck needs more relief.
The truss rod needs to be adjusted if inspection of the neck indicates that it needs either more or less relief.

,


Depending on the model of your bass, you will need a small Phillips screwdriver to remove the screws securing the truss rod cover or a small flat-blade screwdriver to ""pop"" or pry off the truss rod cover.

,


If the neck needs less relief, you will tighten the truss rod by turning the truss rod nut clockwise.
If the neck needs more relief, you will turn the truss rod nut counterclockwise.

, After a 1/8-turn, tune the strings again and remeasure the string height.

,,


If there is fret buzz when playing at any of the first 5 frets, the neck is too straight and the truss rod needs to be loosened.
If there is fret buzz only above the 12th fret, there is too much relief in the neck and the truss rod needs to be tightened.
If there is fret buzz consistently up the neck, the truss rod is likely set properly and the bridge needs to be raised to adjust the action.

,


If your bass does not have individual saddle height adjusting screws, you must adjust the action by raising or lowering the entire bridge. There are many bridge designs, each with its own specific adjustment features. Select the proper tool for the adjustment hardware on your bass. Typically, tightening (turning clockwise) bridge height adjusters will raise the action and loosening (turning counterclockwise) bridge adjustment adjusters will lower the action.
If your bass has individual saddle height adjusting screws, make general action adjustments by raising or lowering the entire bridge, then make your final adjustments by changing the height of the individual string saddles. Individual string saddles are generally adjusted with allen wrenches.

, You have lowered the action too much if you hear fret buzz.

Determine your budget.,
Ask bass players for recommendations.,
Research different brands.,
Look for a model that fits your playing ability.,
Choose a starter bass guitar if you are a beginner.,
Decide how many strings you need.,
Look for a bass guitar with frets, unless you are an experienced player.",How to Buy a Used Bass Guitar1," Before you research types of used guitars, decide what your budget is beforehand. Bass guitars are usually cheaper when used, but different models will be pricier than others. Think about what you need this guitar for and what quality you'd prefer so you don't overspend.

If you are a hobbyist or new player, commit to a certain budget beforehand so you're not lured into buying a more expensive brand.;
, Talk to more experienced bass players and ask them what they'd recommend for you. Tell them your experience level and what you're hoping to get from your new guitar. Ask them what model they used and why they chose it.

You can also ask them where they got their guitar and whether it was used. If they bought theirs new, ask them if they know of any used instrument stores in the area. A fellow musician will have your best interests (both quality and price) in mind.

, Bass guitar brands range in price and quality. Your needs as a musician and your personal style might fit one brand better than another. The most respected brand for bass players is Fender because it offers a variety of guitars depending on a player's skill level, musical style, and budget.Other popular brands include Yamaha, Music Man, and Ibanez.No one bass guitar brand is necessarily better than another, but certain brands are superior in specific qualities. Research the pros and cons of each brand and determine which best fits your musical tastes.

, Most brands will have a range of guitars, with more complicated models for advanced players. A model in your playing range will fit you best regardless of which company made it., Starter bass guitars are an inexpensive option for new players. Most companies offer affordable starter basses made from lower-quality hardware but still very playable and user-friendly., Bass guitars traditionally have four strings, but five-string, six-string, and beyond models exist. The more strings you have, the wider range of notes your bass will be able to play. The cheapest used models will be four-string guitars; they will also be the easiest to play. If you're on a tight budget or you're just starting out, choose a four-string guitar.If you're an experienced bass player on a budget, avoid used starter basses: opt instead for a bass with richer tonewoods and better hardware. Your bass will be a little pricier but will fit your needs for a longer time.

, Fretless base guitars offer a smoother sound but usually require more skill. If this used guitar is your first bass, make sure you find a model with frets. New players don't have the muscle memory or trained ear required to play with fretless guitars."

Note: Past this point, all fret names are relative to the capo. In other words, the ""third fret"" is actually the fifth fret, and so on.;
, Your pinky will go on the third fret of the high E string (G) and your ring finger will go on the third fret of the B string (D). They'll stay here for most of the song!

, Use your index and middle fingers to press on the second frets of the A string and D string. Now, strum all the strings. You'll play a modified Em7 chord. A finger guide is below:




Em7 ChordHigh E string: 3B string: 3G string: 0D string: 2A string: 2Low E string: 0



, Now, shift your middle finger to the third fret of the low E string. Keep your other fingers where they are. Strum all the strings. You'll play a modified G major chord.




G ChordHigh E string: 3B string: 3G string: 0D string: 0A string: 2Low E string: 3



, Again, keep your pinky and ring finger where they are. Move your index finger to the second fret of the G string (A). Strum the four thinnest strings. You'll play a D major chord with the top note (normally F#) raised a half step (to G). This gives you Dsus4.




Dsus4 ChordHigh E string: 3B string: 3G string: 2D string: 0A string: XLow E string: X



, Move your index finger one string down so it's on the second fret of the D string (E). Strum the five thinnest strings. You'll play an A7sus4. If it's easier for you, you can also fret the second fret of the G string (A). This won't affect the sound very much.




A7sus4 ChordHigh E string: 3B string: 3G string: 0D string: 2A string: 0Low E string: X



, Now you know everything you need to jam on the intro section. The entire section is just Em7-G-Dsus4-A7sus4 repeated again and again.


Listen to a recording to get the strumming pattern down. With a little practice, it's not hard — you're doing the same thing for the entire section.

, The verses in this song are very similar to the intro. In fact, the only difference is in this one chord, which only appears in the first verse. To play it, keep your pinky and ring finger on the same two frets that they have been on, then fret the bottom two notes of an open C chord with your other two fingers. In other words, put your middle finger on the third fret of the A string (C) and your index finger on the second fret of the D string (E).




Cadd9 ChordHigh E string: 3B string: 3G string: 0D string: 2A string: 3Low E string: X


For reference, the verses are the parts of the song that start with ""Today was gonna be the day...,"" ""Backbeat, the word is on the street...,"" and so on.

, As noted above, the verses for this song are more or less like the intro. Use the same Em7-G-Dsus4-A7sus4 pattern that you learned for the intro. Repeat this cycle four times for each verse.

, The first verse has this one tiny change in it and that's it — otherwise, it's the exact same. You only want to change the very last Em7, and only in this verse.If you're singing, hit this chord just as you start singing the final word of the verse (""now""). In other words, ""I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do/ about you now(Cadd9).""

, The basic pattern for the bridge is (finally) different from the intro/verse pattern. Luckily, we already know most of the chords we'll use. Start by playing a Cadd9-Dsus4-Em7-Em7 twice. Note that the Em7 repeats.


For reference, the bridge is the part of the song that starts, ""...and all the paths we have to walk are winding..."" You'll switch from the Em7 to the Cadd9 when the second line starts: ""...and all the lights that lead...""

, This is without a doubt the trickiest part of the song, but all it takes is a little practice to master. You'll start out the progression the same as before, but end with a quick run through of G5 chords with a moving bassline. This is easier than it sounds.


First, finger the G5 chord simply by putting your middle finger on the third fret of the low E string (G).


G5 ChordHigh E string: 3B string: 3G string: 0D string: 0A string: 2Low E string: 3


Then, slide your middle finger down one fret and put your index finger on the second fret of the G string (A).


G5/F# ChordHigh E string: 3B string: 3G string: 2D string: 0A string: 0Low E string: 2


Then, move your fingers together to the second frets of the A and D strings (B and E) so that you're basically fingering the Em7 chord from before:


G5/E ChordHigh E string: 3B string: 3G string: 0D string: 2A string: 2Low E string: 0


Hit these chords on ""like,"" ""say,"" and ""you"": ""There are many things that I would like (G5) to say (G5/F#) to you (G5/E)...""

, After the fast passage above, just fret the same G5 chord from before, then switch to the A7sus4 chord and keep strumming it for a few repetitions. You've just made your way through the bridge. Transition from the held A7sus4 to the chorus section (below).


Hit the A7sus4 chord on ""how"": ""...like to say to you, but I don't know how (A7sus4)...""

, The chorus is easy — you're just playing chords you've already learned in a steady pattern. Play this progression four times for the chorus.


For reference, the chorus is the part of the song that starts, ""because maybe/ you're gonna be the one that saves me...""

, This is only after the first chorus. In the recording, there's about a measure of rest after the last Em7 of the chorus. Then, as the song transitions into the third verse, there's about a measure of A7sus4 strumming that switches to Em7 strumming as soon as the verse starts.


Listening to the recording will help a lot here. The timing with the rest beats can be a little challenging to get at first.

, Now that you know all of the parts of the song, you just need to stitch them together. For the intro, you'll play:Em7-G-Dsus4-A7sus4 (4X)

, The verse progression isn't really different than the intro besides the one Cadd9, but for our purposes the verse starts with the first ""Today was gonna be the day..."" The first two verses come right in a row, but remember that only the first verse gets the Cadd9. In other words, you'll play:Em7-G-Dsus4-A7sus4
Em7-G-Dsus4-A7sus4
Em7-G-Dsus4-A7sus4

Cadd9-G-Dsus4-A7sus4
Em7-G-Dsus4-A7sus4 (4X)

, This is fairly straight forward — you just need to play each part once. In other words, play:Cadd9-Dsus4-Em7-Em7 (2X)
Cadd9-Dsus4-G5-G5/F# -G5/E
G5-A7sus4-A7sus4-A7sus4
Cadd9-Em7-G-Em7 (4X)
A7sus4 (right before third verse)

, Here, you're only playing one verse, but you're playing two choruses. In other words, play:Em7-G-Dsus4-A7sus4 (4X)
Cadd9-Dsus4-Em7-Em7 (2X)
Cadd9-Dsus4-G5-G5/F# -G5/E
G5-A7sus4-A7sus4-A7sus4
Cadd9-Em7-G-Em7 (8X)

, After the third chorus, the singing stops, but the instruments keep playing the Cadd9-Em7-G-Em7 four more times. If you're playing live, make sure everyone in your band knows when to stop!


If you stretch this section out, it makes a good place to take a solo since the singer isn't singing anymore.

Wherever you start your index finger is the type of chord you'll be playing. If you started on the 5th fret of the E string you'd be playing an A power chord, for example.






;
, Continuing the example of the G power chord, you place your ring finger on the 5th fret of the A string. This simple form -- two strings, two frets apart, is all you need for a power chord.









--X--
--X--
--X--
--X--
--5--
--3--

, If you would like, add in an octave by simply barring your ring finger on the string below, here the D string. You can also use your pinky. Your final chord would look like this:









--X--
--X--
--X--
--5--
--5--
--3--

, You can use the fleshy part of your index finger to lightly dampen the lower strings, resting on them so you can't hear them when you strum. However, unless you're making big, dramatic strumming motions you can just focus on playing the right strings.








, Remember, power chords are movable; you can play them anywhere by maintaining this same shape and hand position. Start on the 5th fret, 5th string to play a D, slide down two frets and play an E. Come up a string to the 7th fret, 6th string and play a B power chord. You can move anywhere.









Remember that, in terms of written music, these chords are often written as fifths, like a G5 or an A#5. They will not be written out as ""G power chord,"" or ""G P.C.""

Check music stores in your town.,
Visit local thrift stores.,
Go to flea markets and pawn shops.,
Look in your city's classifieds.,
Shop online.",How to Buy a Used Bass Guitar2," Often these stores will sell used instruments at a lower price. Employees will be well-versed in instrument quality and be able to help you choose a guitar based on your experience and budget.

Even if a music store does not sell used instruments, chat with the employees about your search. They may know used bass guitar sellers nearby or tell you more about what to look for in a used instrument.
Contact local instrument repair stores as well. Their employees may know of a used guitar seller, or they may even be willing to renovate a used bass guitar for you at a reasonable price.

, Check thrift stores in your area for used bass guitars. Often players will donate their old guitars in decent condition. Bass guitars at thrift stores are not usually in perfect condition, but they are often cheaper. You never know what surprise buy you might find in a thrift store., Flea markets and pawn shops can also be an inexpensive place to buy an instrument. Check for flea market listings in your town and ask vendors if they know of any instrument sellers. Pawn shops also sell items in good condition for a low price, much like thrift stores.

Often pawn shops sell used vintage instruments at a low price. If you are an experienced player, a vintage bass guitar might be of interest to you. Ask the seller or store owner for a certificate of authenticity, especially if the used bass guitar is older.

, Check your city's classifieds online or in the newspaper for people selling their guitars. If you buy a bass guitar from a local seller, you can ask them about their experience with the guitar and what qualities they enjoyed about it.

If you're in no hurry, you could also check local garage sales. Because you never know what someone will sell at their yard sale, this could be a time-consuming process.

, Check online marketplaces or auction sites for used bass guitars. When searching online, make sure to ask the seller lots of questions about their bass guitar and ask for a variety of photos. Because you won't be able to determine its quality in-person, you'll want to get a clear idea of its condition.Don't buy from a seller who uses simple descriptions or refuses to send you more pictures. They may be scamming you or trying to hide a flaw.
Check your seller's feedback before you make a purchase. If they have high ratings, you're more likely to receive a guitar in good condition.

Bring an experienced musician along.,
Try the instrument out for yourself.,
Make sure the length is comfortable for you.,
Check for damages.,
Ask for lots of pictures, if buying your instrument online.",How to Buy a Used Bass Guitar3," If you have a friend who's spent time around musical instruments, bring them along (especially if they also play bass guitar). Even musicians who have little experience around guitars can help you inspect the instrument and determine what condition its in.

If none of your friends are musicians, get to know the different parts of a bass guitar as well as you can. The more you know about the guitar, the better you'll be able to estimate its condition.

, If you're buying the instrument in-person, ask the seller if you can strum the guitar. More experienced musicians will be able to play a few notes on the bass and tune as needed; from there, you'll be able to determine its quality.

Beginners might not know what to look for as much but will still be able to test how the instrument feels in their hands and whether they like its sound.
If you have never played a bass guitar before, ask the seller if they could play a song for you. You'll get a better sense of its condition by watching someone play.

, When holding the guitar in your hands, decide whether the length is comfortable for you. Bass guitars are available in a variety of lengths, and some will fit you better than others. Smaller players should look for guitars with a scale length of 30 inches (76.2 cm) or less.The average bass length is 34 inches (86.3 cm) This will be the most versatile bass length, if your guitar will be used by multiple people., Check for any nicks or cracks in the frame, as even small fractures can distort the bass's sound. Some parts of the guitar, like the strings or tuning keys, can be upgraded. Others, like the neck, are a permanent part of the guitar. Thoroughly examine the guitar, and ask the seller about any possible damages.

If the guitar is in poorer condition but is being sold at a reasonable price, ask the seller if they know of any instrument repair shops. You may consider purchasing a used guitar for a cheap price, then having a repair shop refurbish it.

, Even if you're not inspecting the guitar in-person, you can still get a good sense of its condition. Ask the seller to send pictures of the guitar from a variety of angles, and ask for close-ups of any spots that look damaged.

Ask the seller to make a recording of themselves playing a song on the bass so you know how it sounds. When buying instruments, what you hear is just as important as what you see.

"
Rest the body of the guitar on your right knee, if you're right handed.,
Keep the guitar perpendicular to your body when playing, not leaned back into your chest.,
Remember that guitar strings count up from one to six.,
Use the guitar frets to tell you where to put your fingers.",How to Play Your First Guitar Song1," The curve in the guitar's body will rest on your thigh, with the neck extending out to your left. Of course, left-handed guitarists would reverse, holding the guitar on their left leg. Sit up straight and hold the guitar close to your body, resting it on your thighs, hip, and stomach.






;
, It may feel more comfortable to lean the guitar back, but keeping it upright will help you play more quickly and comfortably. The body of the guitar should stay flush to the leg it rests on.









Resist the temptation to angle the guitar so you can see your hands -- this just makes it harder to play.

, For now, don't even worry about the note names. Just remember that guitar strings count up. The thinnest, lowest string is the first string, while the thickest, heaviest string on top is the sixth string.









If you're curious, the notes of the strings are, from 1st-6th, e-B-G-D-A-E.


, The frets are your key navigation tool on the guitar, and they correspond to different notes on each string. They are the little metal strips on the long, thin neck of the guitar. The first fret is the one farthest away from the body of your guitar. To play a note on the first fret, you put your finger down between the first fret and the head of the guitar.









If you're not holding a fret down on a string, then you are playing an open string.

You always play behind the fret -- if the song wants a note on the ""10th fret,"" you'd put your finger between the 9th and 10th frets on the guitar, as close to the 10th as possible.

Vary your picking articulation.,
Slap the strings with your palm.,
Tap against the body of the guitar with your fingertips.,
Slap the heel or palm of your hand against the guitar body.,
Mute the strings with your fretting hand.,
Borrow techniques from slap bass playing.,
Pay attention to the rhythm of your percussive patterns.",How to Use Percussive Effects on Guitar," The most versatile technique for getting a percussive sound from a guitar string is by picking it very aggressively, either with your finger or a pick. Pulling the string outward from the guitar's body a bit when picking it will cause it to slap back into place, lending a sharp, percussive sound to the note.






;
, Another percussive technique is to slap your picking hand's palm against all the strings. Pushing them hard enough so that they contact the guitar's frets will increase the percussive intensity of this technique. Try employing this slapping technique on the backbeats during a rhythm strumming pattern.








, Of course, drumming against the body of the guitar itself will give you the most drum-like effect of all these techniques. You can use your pinky and ring finger for drumming to keep your other fingers free for picking. You can also free your picking hand entirely for drumming by playing passages entirely using hammer-ons and pull-offs.








, For a deeper, more resounding percussive effect from the guitar body, slap the heel of your hand or entire palm against it. This can be used in conjunction with fingertip drumming to create more intricate drumming patterns.








, When strumming, you can raise your fretting fingers off the neck and hold them just over the strings to mute them. Playing strumming patterns with the strings muted like this will create a tight, crisp, percussive tone.








, ""Slap bass"" is a style of playing bass in which the strings are deliberately clapped against the frets with the thumb when sounding low notes. Try this technique when playing the low ""E"" string to create sharp, crisp bass notes.








, Of course, using percussive effects on guitar is most effective when you apply these techniques within common drumming rhythms. Try adding percussive accents to the backbeats of a strumming pattern, for example; in 4/4 time this would mean on beats 2 and 4.

"
Start with a pick for easier beginner strumming.,
Relax your elbow and strum from the wrist.,
Practice brushing the pick over the strings in each direction to start strumming.",How to Play Your First Guitar Song2," Because they are thinner and made of hard plastics, picks are much easier to strum with early on, though there is no real ""right"" way to learn. Make an ""O"" shape with your fingers by placing the pad of your thumb on top of the side of your index finger. Slide the pick in between to hold it with firm, comfortable control.









If you're having trouble holding onto the pick, try using your middle finger as well for stability.
Most people start with a medium, pointed pick, something around .7mm in thickness. Again, however, your comfort playing is more important than any ""right"" choice of picking device. Some people would rather use their fingers, after all.

, Keep your arm nice and loose, moving with a comfortable, relaxed swing of your wrist. Think of having a feather stuck to your thumb, and you're shaking your wrist to try and get it to come off. Strum the strings a couple of times, focusing on a smooth, fluid motion.









A common mistake for beginners is to tense up, trying to mechanically strum each note perfectly, or working to hard to strum with speed. Focus, instead, on natural, comfortable motion.

, Once you have the basic motions down, work on hitting all six strings with relaxed, calm down strokes, counting each one out (""1 and, 2 and, 3 and, 4 and, 1..."") to stay in rhythm. Then try some simple upwards strums, noticing how they feel a little different. Most guitarists notice that need less strumming strength and can skip the top 2-3 strings to get a good sound strumming upwards.









Strumming should feel easy, gliding over the strings. If you're having difficulty, try to dig the pick less into the strings, just brushing it over the strings instead.

Cup your hand into a C shape, holding the neck of the guitar in the curve between thumb and fingers.,
Press your middle finger into the space on the 5th string, 2nd fret.,
Press your ring finger into the space on the 4th string, 2nd fret.,
Strum each string in the chord slowly, making sure it sounds out.,
Learn a second chord to build your first song.,
Practice your two chords by strumming, removing your hand, then reforming the chord.",How to Play Your First Guitar Song3," Your thumb presses lightly on the back of the fretboard while your four fingers are free to press down on the strings. Your wrist shouldn't be kinked too far forward or backwards -- the back of your hand will be almost parallel to the floor.









While you should adjust for comfort, remember to keep your wrist from angling away from the strings.

, Remember, the 5th string is the second from the top. Your middle finger presses the string into the back of the 2nd fret, holding it only as hard as you need for a clean sound. You can check by picking the string -- do you hear any buzzing, or is it a clean, pleasant tone?








, Simply hold down the 4th string just like you did before, keeping your middle finger on the string above it. These two frets are all you need to hold for your first chord. This chord, with the two fingers on the 2nd fret, is an E-minor chord.








, Check for dead or buzzy strings, which usually happen when you accidentally drape some of your finger over a string without fretting it. To avoid this, think about curling your fingers so that only your fingertips are pressing into the frets. Also, pull your elbow closer into your body -- it makes it easier to position your hand.









The closer you are to the back of the frets the better your notes will sound.
The fingers you're fretting with should only be touching the strings they are supposed to be touching.

, This second chord, a D2 chord, matches perfectly with your Em to write your first song. To play it, ignore the top two strings, the 6th and 5th strings. Place your index finger on the 2nd fret of the 3rd string. Then place your ring finger on the 3rd fret of the 2nd string. This is it -- simply strum the bottom four strings, the thinner ones.








, Learning chords is not easy at first, and changing chords can be the hardest thing newbies have to do. To make life easier, make sure you have each chord memorized and down pat -- you should be able to quickly form them as soon as your hand touches the guitar.









Simply form the chord, strum, remove your hand, and repeat. Remember, however, that playing a chord quickly is useless if it sound buzzy or muted -- focus first on quality over quickness.
Think about how a chord feels, not just how it looks. Can your fingers find the chord without your eyes?

"
"
Practice chord transitions by focusing just on moving from Em to D2.,
Strum the Em for one full measure.,
Switch to the D2 chord after one measure.,
Pick a comfortably slow, regular strumming pattern, counting it out as your practice.,
Practice different rhythms as you become more comfortable, alternating the chords every measure.",How to Play Your First Guitar Song4," Once you have both chords memorized stone cold, just work on moving back and forth between them. Strum the Em once, then try to move your hands right to D2. Transition back, pause, then do it again.









You should be able to go right to the chord, from memory, before learning to transition between them.

, This means you play the Em for a full count of ""1, 2, 3, 4,"" or one whole measure. You can use any strumming pattern you want. If you're struggling, however, simply strum each chord on the one, then use the rest of the measure to prepare to shift chords until you get faster.









Remember, the Em is when you have a finger on the 2nd fret of the 5th and 4ths strings

, On the ""one"" of the second measure, go to the D2. Then simply alternate each measure, switching chords on the one every time.









Remember, the D2 is when you have a finger on the 2nd fret of the 3rd string, and a finger on the 3rd fret of the 2nd string.

, Always count out the song to practice your rhythm -- ""1, 2, 3, 4 // 1, 2, 3, 4"" The earlier chords are from America's hit ""Horse with No Name,"" and you could try to mimic the pattern on the record with a simple strum on every count of the song (""1, 2, 3, 4 // 1, 2, 3, 4 // 1, 2, 3...""). If this is hard, however, just work on only one strum per measure, strumming on the one beat.









The actual song uses ""swung eighth notes,"" which you can practice once your chords are down. Eighth notes are when you count, and play, on every beat (""1 and, 2 and, 3 and, 4 and // 1 and..."") If you're curious, the ""swung"" part is when your alternate a hard downstroke on the count (1 and, 2 and...) with a quick upstroke on ""ands."" The result is a kind of plodding, horse-like rhythm.

, Once you've got the hang of things, challenge yourself to try newer strumming styles. Play a little faster, though remember to make sure you still hit the chords cleanly and without buzzing. Then, move on to several new chords and beginner songs to keep getting better.

","How to Play the Solo from ""Eruption"" (Eddie Van Halen)"," It is very challenging to learn this piece without the audio aid.;
, The steps in this article are based on that tab. Understand that the measures are divided by a dotted line, not a solid line. I assume that this is because, for the first half of the piece, Eddie doesn't really follow any definable time signature. There are some parts of this tab which are a bit off, due to the extreme speed of his playing. A friend of mine and I know this to be true, because we used a program named ""Sony Acid Pro"" to slow it down to half speed, where we could listen to and distinguish every note being played.

, This is the tuning he uses, and it really does help the speed, because the strings are looser.

, This is not optional.

,


In measure 1, ignore what they say, and start with a slide down from fret 7 on the A string. Measure 2 is authentic, but you can ignore the palm mutes if you want. If you don't want to, palm mute LIGHTLY.
Measure 3 is a bit more challenging. Up to the point where you play fret 5 on both b and high-e strings, it is authentic. After that, the publishers made a mistake. Each sequence of -8-5-0- on the b string followed by -8- on the g string followed by open e string is actually -8-5-0- followed by -8- on the b string the first time through, only you leave the open e string out, and hold the -8- on the g string for emphasis. After that, it is actually -5-8-5-0-, with no g or e string at all. (Note the different sequence on the b string. This is the correct way to play it.) The exact same rule applies to the beginning of measure 4, where the sequence is repeated one more time.
Measure 4 is literally almost half wrong. After the already corrected sequence, he doesn't play -7- on g, -5- on b, and then -5- on e. He actually plays open d, -7- on g, and -5- on b. He doesn't play the following -8-5- pull-off on b, the -7- 1/2 bend on g, or the -5- on b, so skip 'em. From then until the end of measure 4 is correct.
Measure 5 is correct up until the slide from -3- to -15- on the (a) string. But this is easy to correct...simply play the -3- and leave out the slide. Note the dive-bomb with the whammy bar on open e. Do not play the little -15- (on a) to open-a pull-off. It is incorrect.
When you play the chord progression in measures 6 and 7, have fun with it. This is usually where he does the scissors 4 feet (1.2 m) in the air, so play it nice and slowly with a lot of emphasis.
At the end of measure 7, the slide is not from -3- to natural harmonic at -19- on the b string. It is actually from -2- to natural harmonic at -19- on the g string.
In measure 8, do not bend the last -20- (on b) of the -20- (on b) to -17- (on e) sequence. Leave out the -20- that comes right after you play the open g.
In measure 9, do not bend the second -19- (on b) 1 1/2. Instead, bend the -20- (on b) one full bend. Also, when you have just finished the full -20- (on e) bend, and you have pulled off to -17- (on e) do not play the -17- (on e) after you have played the -20- (on b). Just go into the next sequence.
In measure 10, do not play the whammy bar from -20- on b. Move on to the slide.
Until measure 18, the tabs are correct. Polish your picking skills. You will be picking very, very quickly from measure 12 to measure 17.
Measures 18 and 19 have some faults. Ignore the -7- to -8- slide on the d string, and, right after that, instead of what they say, play -5-0-4- (on g) followed by -6-0-5- (on b) followed by -7-0-5- (on g) followed by -8-0-7-5- on (on b) first bending and then trilling the last -5-. At the end of measure 19, leave out the open d string, and slide from open e to -7- on e instead of -5- to -7-.
Measures 20 and 21 make up the exact same tune of measures 18 and 19, only transposed. Instead of playing the -7- (on a) after you do the second -5-0- pull-off (on d) hammer on a -4- (on d) and then play -5-0-4- (on g) followed by -7-0-5- (on d) followed by -7-0-6-4- (on g) and trill the last -4- half a step.
At the end of measure 21, through measure 22, repeat the same sequence that you played in measures 18 and 19, and it's easier to transpose the -11-9-11-9-and so on (on g) in measures 22 and 23 up to the b string, where you would start with -7-5-7-5-.
Measure 24 through measure 39 is totally two hand tapping. Eddie actually plays it on the b string, not the g string, so if you transpose (which is advisable since it's actually easier the way he does it) then you would start with -14-2-5- (b string) and then go into -9-2-5- (also b string).
In measures 31, 32, and 33 where he starts his decent, the (transposed to b string) the notes are actually -17-12-15--17-11-14--17-11-14--17-10-13--17-9-12--17-9-12--17-12-15- -12-15--17-11-14--17-11-14--17-10-13--17-10-13--17-9-12--17-9-12- and so on.

Start in standard EADGBE tuning.,
Tune the sixth string to a D reference tone.,
Tune the rest of your strings as normal.,
Play!",How to Tune a Guitar to Drop D1," Regardless of whether or not you get your guitar into Drop D with a tuner, it's usually easiest to start from ordinary EADGBE tuning. This is because only one note is different between the tunings — change this note, and you're ready to play. This guide assumes that you're familiar with the notes in standard tuning; as a reminder, here are the notes you'll want each string tuned to (reference tones for these notes are readily available from tuner programs online):Sixth (thickest) string: E



 


Fifth string: A






Fourth string: D






Third string: G






Second string: B






First (thinnest) string: E (two octaves up from the sixth string E)





;
, Next, use your tuner to play a D. In a pinch, you can use the D note that's normally used for the fourth string — if you do this, don't forget that your sixth string will be exactly one octave below this tone. Some tuners, however, can be adjusted to give you the proper drop D tone (this tone is technically called ""D3"").


If your tuner can't be adjusted to play D3, note that this reference tone can easily be accessed with any number of adjustable online tuner programs., Since the only note that is different between standard tuning and Drop D tuning is the sixth string, your guitar should now technically be in tune. However, it's a very good habit to give the rest of your strings a quick tuning anyway just to ensure that they're perfectly in tune with your new bass note — even a minor inconsistency can produce ugly-sounding chords.


Keep in mind that, since your sixth string is now tuned to D, you'll use its seventh fret (not its fifth) to tune the fifth string. The rest of the strings can be tuned as normal for standard tuning.

, Congratulations! Your guitar is now tuned to Drop D and is ready to play. As a reminder, its strings should now be tuned to the following tones:


Sixth (thickest) string: D

Fifth string: A

Fourth string: D

Third string: G

Second string: B

First (thinnest) string: E

Remember that frets count from the head down. If you're right-handed, the first fret is all the way to your left.;
, Remember that the strings count from the bottom up, so the thinnest string is the 1st and the thickest is the 6th. Place you index finger down on the 2nd fret, 3rd string.

, Your two fingers will be diagonal to each other.

, When you're done, you should have a triangle shape across the bottom three strings. This is your finished D chord!

, Ignore the top two thickest strings on the guitar -- they are not used for the chord and will muck up the sound.

, This simply three-fingered shape can be slide up and down the bottom three strings to make more chords. Practice playing moving up and down the neck, searching out other chords.


Note: Your ring finger determines the root of the chord. If it is on a B, then the chord is a B.

Start in standard EADGBE tuning.,
Tune the seventh fret of the sixth string to the open fifth string.,
Alternatively, tune to the open fourth string.",How to Tune a Guitar to Drop D2," If you don't have a tuner or any reference tones handy, it's still possible to get your guitar into Drop D tuning, provided that it's already well-tuned to standard tuning. For this reason, you'll once again want to begin with your guitar in standard tuning.

, Next, begin to lower the pitch of your sixth string (currently tuned to low E). As you do this, play its seventh fret with along with the fifth string (open). If your guitar was already well-tuned, your sixth string should be tuned to D as soon as the tone of its seventh fret perfectly matches the tone of the open fifth string (which is A).

, You can also tune your sixth string so that it matches the tone of the fourth string (currently tuned to D). However, if you do this, you'll need to keep in mind that your sixth string's tone will be exactly one octave beneath your fourth string's. Some guitarists find it a little more difficult to judge the difference between these two tones than it is to use the fifth string (A) to tune the sixth string.


Note that you don't have to commit to this method or the one above — it's perfectly acceptable to use both the fourth and fifth string to get the sixth tuned to D.

The best way to start getting the hang of Drop D is to start using it in songs!",How to Tune a Guitar to Drop D3," Now that your sixth string is tuned to low D, the range of your guitar is slightly greater. You have two new notes at your disposal: low D, played by strumming the sixth string in the open position, and Eb, played at the first fret of the sixth string. Being able to play these new low notes opens up several exciting possibilities for your playing.


The most obvious of these is perhaps the fact that you can now play chords and scales with a root note of low D or Eb. This is especially useful for songs that rely heavily on these chords.
Another less obvious benefit is that you now have new bass notes for finger-picking playing styles (which are commonly used in folk music). This gives you the opportunity to use these low notes as bass tones, pedal tones, and so on. It's even possible to use the low D note as a drone note., One of the biggest advantages of Drop D tuning is that it can make power chords on the thickest strings very easy to play. Specifically, because the sixth string is a whole step lower than in standard tuning, a power chord is played in the same fret for all three lower-pitched strings. This means that, rather than requiring three fingers to play, power chords can be played with just a single finger. Simply lay your finger across the D, A, and D strings similar to how you would barre a chord to fret a power chord in Drop D.

It's worth noting that Drop D also makes it easier to switch between power chords quickly. This is used to great effect in hard rock and metal music — some songs would be very difficult or impossible to play in anything but Drop D.

, Below is a short selection of songs that use Drop D tuning — some are easy, some are hard, but all of them should have tabs readily available online to help you learn them:""Dear Prudence"" by The Beatles
""Everlong"" by The Foo Fighters
""Moby Dick"" by Led Zeppelin
""Never Going Back Again"" by Fleetwood Mac
""Blackhole Sun"" by Soundgarden

Go to the fifth fret of the guitar.,
Bar the 5th fret with your index finger, getting all but the top string.,
Use your ring finger to barre the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th strings at the 7th fret.,
Leave the bottom string barred, or simply don't play it.",How to Play the D Chord for Guitar2," This is a slightly ""thicker,"" higher-pitched D chord. It is also much easier to get to when you're further down the neck, and easily transitions into other barre chords.


If you already know it, this is simply an A-major barre chord located on the 5th fret, 5th string. This note is a D.

, Barre from the 1st to the 5th string with your index finger. Strum once to ensure that all of the strings are properly pressed down.

, You can also place your pinkie on the 2nd string, seventh fret, your ring finger on the 3rd string, 7th fret and your middle finger on the 4th string, 7th fret. Most people find it easier to just barre the string, but you will get a cleaner sound with individual fingers.


If you slid the entire thing up the neck, using open strings instead of a barred index finger, you'd have an open A chord.

, The top and bottom strings are the least essential for your chord. If you can strum just the middle four strings, you'll have a better-sounding chord, but you can also strum the high-e string for a little more noise.


Do not strum the top string.

"
"
Slide all the way down to the 10th fret.,
Barre the entire 10th fret with your index finger.,
Place your ring finger on the 12th fret, 5th string.,
Place your pinky on the 12th fret, 4th string.,
Place your middle finger on the 11th fret, 3rd string.,
Leave the other strings barred, then strum all six at once.",How to Play the D Chord for Guitar3," This is a very high and bright sounding D-chord, and isn't used too often unless you're playing all of your chords that far down the neck. Still, knowing how to form this chord is a lot of fun, and can give your songs a breath of fresh air when thrown in for a normal D.


This chord is melodically identical to those before it, just at a different ""octave.""

, This is simply an E-form barre chord, meaning you form an E-major chord with your pinky, ring, and middle finger, then barre two frets up with the index. The result is the same shape as a normal E chord, just with barred notes instead of open notes.

, This note is an A. The first note, the one on the 10th fret, 6th string, is a D.

, This is another D.

, This note is an F#, and is needed for a full D chord.

, This chord uses every single string on the guitar, though you can stick just to the top ones for a thicker, slightly deeper chord.

Review the names of strings, frets, and notes.,
Make sure you guitar is tuned.,
Put your ring finger on the third fret of the first string.,
Put your index finger on the second fret of the fifth string.,
Put your middle finger on the third fret of the sixth string.,
Strum all six strings at once to play your chord.,
Practice moving your hand in and out of chord position.",How to Play the G Major Chord on Guitar1," If you're new to guitar, you need to get a handle on the basic terminology that is used with guitars before you set out to learn chords. You can find simple introductions by doing an online search.


Strings count from the bottom up. The thinnest string is the first string, and the thickest is the sixth string. The first string is high E, the second is B, the third is G, the fourth is D, the fifth is A, and the sixth is low E. You may want to create a mnemonic to help you memorize the names of the strings.
Frets are the metal strips down the neck of your guitar. If you're a right-handed guitarist, the first fret is the furthest to your left. The next closest to you is the second, the next one down the third, and so on down the neck of your guitar.
You also should keep in mind how fingers are typically numbered on chord diagrams. Your index finger will be ""1,"" your middle finger is ""2,"" your ring finger is ""3,"" and your pinkie is ""4."" Your thumb is not numbered. While this may seem obvious, it can throw you off if you're used to thinking of your thumb as your first finger.;
, You also can purchase an electronic tuner or use audio guides you can find on the internet. Just do a search for ""acoustic guitar tuner.""








There also are free and paid mobile apps you can download for your phone that will help you tune your guitar. These can be handy if you plan to play or practice your guitar away from home.
Start with the lowest string and tune it first, then move on to the next thickest string, tuning high E last.
With time and practice you'll be able to tune your guitar without assistance, because your ear will be able to distinguish the correct note.

, The third fret of the high E string is a G. This is a root note that gives the chord its ""G"" character. Pluck the individual string a few times to get used to the sound and make sure it's playing clearly.







, The second fret of the A string is a B, one of the three essential notes for a G major chord. Pluck the individual string a few times, then strum from the fifth string down to the first to get used to how these notes sound together.







, The third fret on the low E string is another G, just as the third fret on the high E was G. This means this is another root note. Strum the string alone, then try strumming all together.







, G major is an open chord, which means any strings not fretted are played openly. With your fingers in position, strum all six strings several times, making sure the sound is clean.








If a string sounds muted, you may need to adjust your fingers. Fret with your fingertips, not the pads of your fingers, and keep your hand curled over the neck so you aren't accidentally touching or muting any of the strings.

, Finding the chord shape requires muscle memory, which you must develop through repetition. Remove your hand from the guitar, then place it back with your fingers in chord position.









If this is the first chord you've learned, have patience. It can be difficult to get used to making chord shapes and you might struggle a little at first, but it will get easier with practice.
If you know other chords, practice transitioning from the G major chord to another so you can get the hang of moving fingers between positions.
If your fingers are having trouble quickly reaching the notes, tilt your guitar's neck up in the air. This angle gives your fingers more room to move.

Try the abbreviated version of the G major chord.,
Play the ""rock"" G for a richer, deeper sound.,
Use your pinkie on the high E string.,
Use a D chord shape at the seventh fret.,
Vary it up with a G7 chord.",How to Play the G Major Chord on Guitar2," By simply placing your middle finger on the third fret of the first string, you can create an abbreviated version of the chord that may be easier for you when transitioning between chords.








This abbreviated version is not an open chord. You do not strum the sixth, fifth, or fourth strings of the guitar. Only strum the third, second, and first strings.

, Make the basic G major chord shape, then place your pinkie on the third fret of the second string. This adds another C to your chord and gives your strumming a slightly fuller sound.








Some guitarists find it more comfortable to switch their pinkie and ring fingers. Find the shape that is comfortable for you.

, While the standard fingering of a G major chord puts your ring finger on the high E, you may find it more comfortable to put your pinkie on the high E, using your ring finger on the low E and your middle finger on the A.








, If you know how to make the shape of a D chord, moving your fingers to the seventh fret with your fingers fretting the highest three strings also will produce a G chord.








With the D chord shape, your index and middle fingers are on the seventh fret. Your ring finger is on the eighth fret. Your index finger frets the G, your middle finger frets the high E, and your ring finger frets the B.

, The G7 chord is a bit of a stretch for your fingers, but if you get to the point where you can make this chord shape comfortably, it will provide a bluesier tone to your music.Place your middle finger on the second fret of the A string and your ring finger on the third fret of the low E. You'll notice this is a similar shape to the standard G form, just with different fingers.
Now stretch back your index finger to the first fret of the high E. Remember to keep your hand curled so you don't mute any of the strings.
Strum all six strings openly to play this chord.

"
"
Make a bar with your index finger at the third fret.,
Create an E major chord shape with your remaining fingers.,
Strum all six strings.",How to Play the G Major Chord on Guitar3," Place your index finger flat over all six strings on your guitar to create a bar that will press down on all strings evenly. Make sure your finger is as close to the fret as possible without being on top of it.








Roll your finger onto its side a bit, don't just lay it flat. The tip of your finger should extend over the edge of the fretboard.
You may need to experiment a little moving your wrist around until you find the most comfortable position for you. Make sure you're pinching the neck of the guitar very hard with your thumb so your barre finger stays straight and firm across the strings.

, The G major barre chord is part of the E family of barre chords. Since you've barred your guitar at the third fret, making an E major chord shape results in a G major barre chord.Place your pinkie on the D string at the fifth fret, your ring finger on the A string at the fifth fret, and your middle finger on the G string at the fourth fret.

, Once you've got your fingers in place, strum all six strings openly to play the chord. Make sure all strings are vibrating cleanly and there aren't any strings muted or muffled.








You may want to strum slowly across all six strings to check the sound from each string.
Make sure your non-barre fingers are curled, so that you're only fretting with your fingertips.
Keep in mind that it takes a lot of practice to play a barre chord successfully. Don't give up if you find it difficult at first.

Place your index/pointer finger on the first and second strings on the first fret.,
Place your middle finger on the third string on the second fret.,
Place your ring finger on the fourth string on the third fret.,
Practice picking and strumming the bottom four strings.",How to Play the F Chord on Guitar1," In other words, you are using your index finger to hold down the E and B strings on the first fret. Use the pad of your finger to cover both strings with only one finger.


Try rolling your finger slightly back towards the headstock, so you're pressing down on the side of your finger instead of the fleshy part. This section is a little harder, making it easier to fret with.;
, In other words, use your middle finger to hold down the G string (third from bottom) on the second fret.


, In other words, use your ring finger to hold down the D string (fourth from bottom) on the third fret.



If possible, lightly touch the fifth (A) string with the tip of your third finger -- this mutes the string so it can't be heard while strumming. While not essential now, this is an great technique to practice as you continue playing guitar.

, Once all of your fingers are firmly in place, practice picking the bottom four strings until each note rings clearly. Pick each note individually to make sure they all sound out clean and clear.











If you hit a bum note, readjust your finger placement until you can play it clearly. The first and second strings are usually the most problematic -- check that your second and third fingers are curled directly onto the appropriate strings, rather than lying against the ones underneath.
Once you can play each note clearly, practice strumming the F chord. Also, practice changing from F to another chord, then back again. You may be painfully slow at first, but you'll eventually get the hang of it.

"
"
Graduate to the open F, or the ""old school F,"" for a fuller, richer chord.,
Place your first finger on the first and second strings on the first fret.,
Place your second finger on the third string on the second fret.,
Place your fourth finger on the fourth string on the third fret.,
Place your third finger on the fifth string on the third fret.",How to Play the F Chord on Guitar2," This version of the F major chord, nicknamed ""old-school F"" (as it was popular with musicians in the 60s and 70s), adds one extra note to the F described above, giving it a fuller, rounder sound. It is slightly harder to play than the ""mini"" F, but easier to play than the full barre chord F described below.










, In other words, place your index finger on the E and B strings on the first fret. This is identical to the beginning of the F played above.


, In other words, place your middle finger on the G string on the second fret. This note is an A.


, In other words, place your pinkie finger on the D string on the third fret. You'll be on an F -- your root note for the chord.


, In other words, place your ring finger on the A string on the third fret.



This is the extra note. Your third finger is now placed on the A string while your pinkie finger is placed on the D string -- you can swap these two fingers around if you like, but most people find this position easier.
If possible, lightly touch the sixth (E) string with the tip of your third finger -- this mutes the string so it can't be heard while strumming.

"
"
Barre the first fret.,
Place the rest of your fingers.,
Play other barre chords.",How to Play the F Chord on Guitar3," Place your index finger across all six strings on the first fret and press down. This version of F is the most traditional, and contains all of the notes without any shortcuts. This makes it the biggest, fullest version of the chord.



Roll your finger slightly back towards the headstock, so you are pressing with the hard, bony side of your finger rather than the soft, fleshy middle. Barring takes some practice to get comfortable.
You will need to apply quite a lot of pressure to hold down all six strings. Try squeezing your thumb against the back of the neck for extra support.

, Holding your first finger in the barre position, form your second, third and fourth fingers into the shape of an E chord, starting on the second fret. More specifically:



Place your second finger on the third (G) string on the second fret.
Place your third finger on the fifth (A) string on the third fret.
Place your fourth finger on the fourth (D) string on the third fret.

, The finger position used for the F major barre chord is an example of what is known as an E barre formation, as the fingers following the barre make the shape of a basic E chord.











For example: keeping your fingers in the same formation as the F barre chord, slide your hand down the neck of the guitar until your index finger is on the third fret. This is a G barre chord. If your index finger is on the fifth fret, you are playing an A chord. You can move this form anywhere.

Learn on an electric guitar.,
Buy newer, thinner strings.,
Lower the action.",How to Play the F Chord on Guitar4," If you have a choice between an electric and an acoustic guitar, learn to play the F chord on an electric guitar first. The thinner strings and faster fretboard make it much easier to maneuver around the strings, especially for barre chords.











The strings are closer to the fretboard on an electric guitar, so playing doesn't require as much finger strength.

, One good tip is to buy thinner strings for your guitar (preferably size 9s on an electric and size 10s on an acoustic) if your current strings are very thick.



Thinner strings don't require as much pressure to hold down, so they will save your fingers some pain!
If you want to learn how to change the strings on your guitar, see this article.

, The action of your guitar refers to how high the strings are placed above the fretboard. This requires professional servicing, but is a key step to make playing and learning guitar far more fun.



The lower the action, the less pressure you'll need to apply to the strings. Cheaper guitar often have very high action, which can be a problem for newer guitar players.
Luckily, guitar shops are usually able to lower the action of any guitar as part of a set-up service. You'll have to pay money for this, but it could potentially make your guitar a lot nicer to play!

Review the basics of strings, notes and frets briefly if you're new to guitar.,
Place your ring finger on the 5th string, 3rd fret.,
Place you middle finger on the 4th string, 2nd fret.,
Place your index finger on the 2nd string, 1st fret.,
Strum the bottom five strings.,
Try the alternate fingerings for a richer open chord.,
Focus on getting your fingers as close to the fret as possible.",How to Play the C Major Chord on Guitar1," Knowing how to talk about the guitar will make it much easier to learn your chords. Luckily, numbering on the guitar is easy:










The strings count from the bottom up, not from the top down. The string closest to the floor while holding the guitar, and the thinnest string, is the 1st string.
The first fret is the furthest to your left (if you're a right-handed guitarist). The frets are the metal strips in the guitar, and the furthest from your body is the ""first fret."" The next one closest to you is the second, the next the third, and so on.

Make sure you guitar is tuned. You can purchase an electric tuner or use an audio guide found on Youtube or Google.;
, Remember that the 5th string is the second from the top, not the bottom. Your ring finger goes between the 3rd and 2nd fret. This note is a C.









The closer you push your finger to the 3rd fret, the better your chord will sound.

, Again, get as close to the fret as you can. Try to use your fingertips to fret as precisely as possible. This is the E note in this chord.








, This is the high C note for this chord. Now you've reached the chord's final shape, and it looks like a diagonal line pointing away from your head towards the ground.









The open note between the 2nd and 4th strings is a G.

, All you need are these three fingers. While it won't be terrible if you accidentally play the top string, the chord will sound much better if you ignore it.








, Take your ring finger off the 4th string and drop it to the 6th string, 3rd fret. Then use your pinky to once again fret the 4th string, 3rd fret. This adds another G into the chord for a thicker, richer sound.








, For the best sounding chords, use the tips of your fingers, placing them as close to the frets as you possibly can. Pick each string individually to see if any of the notes aren't sounding out well, and could use an adjustment.








"

Move up to the 3rd fret for a higher-pitched C-major.,
Use your index finger to bar the third fret for a C-major barre chord.,
Move up to the eighth fret for another C-major barre chord.",How to Play the C Major Chord on Guitar2," This variation on the C Major chord starts at the 3rd fret—hence the name ""third position."" Place your fingers as shown below:









Place your first finger at the 3rd fret, on the 5th string. Press your finger flat into the neck so that all five strings are held down on the 3rd fret.
Place your second finger at the 5th fret, on the 4th (D string). This is the G note.
Place your third finger at the 5th fret, on the 3rd (G string). This is the C note.
Place your fourth finger at the 5th fret, on the 2nd (B string). This is the high E note.
When you strum, don't play the bottom or top strings. Just play the middle four.

, For this version, place your first finger across all the strings at the 3rd fret. Place your other three fingers as described above. This is called a barre chord, or sometimes ""bar chord."" You lay your index finger flat on the guitar, fretting all five strings on the 3rd fret. Now you can strum the bottom two strings with the others.








, Will start this next position on the 8th fret. Notice the frets are much closer up here, and the notes sound somewhat higher.









Place your first finger at the 8th fret across all the strings. Push down so that you've got all the strings barred.
Place your second finger at the 9th fret of the 3rd string (G string). This note is an E.
Place your 3rd and 4th fingers at the 10th fret, on the 4th and 5th strings, respectively. Strum all the strings.

Find the root note of the scale.,
Memorize the notes in the C Major scale.,
Use the corresponding finger on the corresponding fret.,
Say or sing the name of the note as you play the scale.,
Sound out a melody with the notes.",How to Play the C Major Scale on Guitar1," The root note of any scale is the note that gives the scale its name. Therefore, the root note of the C Major scale is a C. The root note also is the lowest note on the scale.You can find C on the third fret of the fifth string of your guitar. Fret the string with your index finger. Just use your fingertip so the string sounds cleanly and you don't mute any of the other strings. Keep the rest of your fingers curled over the keys. Think of making the shape of a ""C"" with your fingers around the fret board.
Scales repeat through octaves, so the scale naturally progresses back to the root note, which will then be one octave higher.;
, The notes of the C Major scale are C-D-E-F-G-A-B. These notes remain the same regardless of the octave.








If you find it easier to play by ear with reference notes, find an audio recording of the C Major scale online and listen to it. Sing along with the names of the notes until you have the notes memorized. Then try to find those notes on your guitar.

, When you learn to play guitar, your fingers are numbered in a universal way. The frets on your guitar also are numbered. In first position, the finger number and the fret number are the same, so that your first finger is on the first fret.








In case you aren't familiar, your first finger is your index finger, your second finger is your middle finger, your third finger is your ring finger, and your fourth finger is your pinky.
After first position, the relations between finger numbers and fret numbers change. For example, if your first finger is on the second fret, your hand is in second position. The second finger has access to the third fret, your third finger to the fourth fret, and so on.
Remember to use just the tip of your finger to fret the strings, and keep your other fingers curled over the fret board when you're not using them to fret a string.

, When you first play the C Major scale, do it slowly. Saying or singing each note aloud as you play will help reinforce the names of the notes in your head.








If you can sing the note (in tune), this will help you associate the name of the note with a particular sound. When you hear that sound in a different octave, you will automatically know what note it is.

, Once you've learned the notes to the C Major scale, play around with the notes. You'll discover simple melodies that can be played simply with the notes from the C Major scale.








For example, you can play the song ""Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star"" using only the notes from the C Major scale. In fact, this song can be played entirely on one string on your guitar.
Practicing simple songs like this is a good way to become familiar with the scale itself and the relations between the notes.

"
Memorize the interval formula for major scales.,
Find the root note.,
Move up one whole step from the root note.,
Follow the formula to map the scale.,
Practice playing the scale on one string.",How to Play the C Major Scale on Guitar2," All major scales are formed using the same interval formula. Once you've memorized this formula, you can not only figure out how to play the C Major scale, you can learn any other major scale by applying the formula.








Intervals are specified by whole and half steps. On your guitar, a whole step is two frets, while a half step is one fret.
For all major scales, there is a whole step between the first and second notes, a whole step between the second and third notes, and a half step between the third and fourth notes. Then you have whole steps between the rest of the notes up until the seventh note. There is a half step between the seventh and eighth notes. This interval formula can be abbreviated W-W-H-W-W-H.

, The root note of any scale is the note that names the scale. So for the C Major scale, the root note is C. In first position, you'll find this note on the third fret of the fifth string., On your guitar neck, one whole step equates to two frets. So if you started on the third fret of the fifth string, the second note in the C major scale would be on the fifth fret of the fifth string., Using the interval formula, you can accurately play the C Major scale on any given string, starting from the root note. A whole step up from C is D, another whole step up is E, a half step to F, and so on.








Sing the names of the notes along with your playing to connect the notes to the intervals.

, Every major scale can be played on each individual string. When learning the scale by interval, this is one of the easiest ways to understand the relation between the notes and prepare you to move up and down the neck with a scale.








While normally you will play a scale across several strings, moving up and down a single string can help you understand the logic of how notes are arranged in scales and octaves. Try this if you are a beginning guitarist – the understanding will help you pick up more complex melodies later.
When you're playing the entire scale on one string, you also can simply move one finger up and down the fret board, rather than worrying about changing fingers. This will help you become more familiar with moving around on the neck of your guitar.

"
"
Start with chords that you know.,
Study pattern diagrams.,
Link together single-octave patterns to make multi-octave patterns.",How to Play the C Major Scale on Guitar3," If you already know a few chords on guitar, it may be easier for you to learn scales by pattern than by note or interval. When you play a chord on guitar, you're playing every other note of the scale starting with the root note, which gives the chord its name.








When you find chords within scales, you can blend the two together to improvise sequences on your guitar.
If you know the root note of a chord, you can figure out the scale for that note from the chord alone, especially if you've already learned the interval formula.

, You can find pattern diagrams online or in books on how to play guitar. By memorizing these diagrams, or finger shapes, you can easily play a number of different scales and chords up and down the neck of your guitar.Pattern diagrams may be the easiest way for you to learn if you are a visual learner. Finding patterns also can be more fun than memorizing notes or following an interval formula.
The pattern diagrams show you where to place your fingers when you're playing a chord. Typically the root note is a black dot and the other notes are blank dots. You also might see finger numbers or notes. Use the type that's easiest for you to understand.

, Once you've become familiar with the single-octave patterns for the C Major scale, you can create larger patterns that cover the whole fretboard and encompass multiple octaves.








Remember that notes repeat as you move up the fretboard. If you fret a string at the first fret, you'll find the same note by fretting that string at the thirteenth fret – just in a different octave.
Single-octave patterns repeat up and down the fretboard, so once you've learned it in one position, move down to the next root note and play it again in a different octave.

Study the chord progression before you start playing.,
Play one measure of C. ""Happy Birthday"" starts on a C major open chord.,
Play two measures of G. On the first beat of the second measure (starting on the ""you"" syllable), play an open G major chord.,
Play two measures of C. Next, on the syllable ""you"", play an open C chord.,
Play one measure of F. On the first beat of the sixth measure, play an F major chord.,
Play two beats of C and one beat of G. The seventh measure is the only one in the song that isn't the same chord for the whole measure.,
End on C. End the song by playing an open C major chord on the final ""you."",
Start with two G pickup notes.,
Play A-G-C in the first measure.,
Play B-G-G in the second measure.,
Play A-G-D in the third measure.,

,
Swing the ""Hap - py"" eighth notes.,
Let each ""you"" note ring a little longer than normal.,
Try playing in different keys.,
Try substituting 7 chords in the third and seventh measures.",How to Play Happy Birthday on Guitar," If you already know how to read chord progressions, simply read this step and skip the rest of this section as the chords to ""Happy Birthday"" are very simple.


Below is the chord progression to ""Happy Birthday"".Happy Birthday
Hap-py |(C) birth - day to |(G) you. Hap-py | birth - day to |(C) you. Hap-py | birth-day dear |(F) (na-ame). Hap-py |(C) birth - day (G) to |(C) you.


A few important things to note about ""Happy Birthday"":

The song uses a 3/4 (waltz) beat. This means that there are three beats per measure and that the quarter note gets one count. This is easy to observe in the first measure: if you follow the lyrics, ""birth - day - to"", each syllable gets one beat.
The song starts with two pickup eighth notes. In other words, the ""Hap-py"" at the start of the song occurs before the first beat as the chords don't kick in until ""Birth-day"".
You can use any strumming pattern that's comfortable for you. A simple one that works well is to simply use a down strum for each quarter note (three per measure.)

;
, This chord is played for the whole first measure, starting on the ""birth"" syllable of ""birthday"". You don't have to play any chords on ""Happy"", since these are pickup notes to the first measure.


An open C major chord is played like this:
Open CHigh E string: Open (0)B string: First fret (1)G string: Open (0)D string: Second fret (2)A string: Third fret (3)Low E string: Not played (X)


You can keep from playing the low E string by muting it with one of your fretting fingers or simply avoiding hitting it with your strumming hand.

, Keep playing this chord through the third measure.


An open G major chord is played like this:
Open GHigh E string: Third fret (3)B string: Open (0)G string: Open (0)D string: Open (0)A string: Second fret (2)Low E string: Third fret (3)



, Keep playing this chord through the fourth and fifth measures and the syllables ""Hap - py birth - day dear...""

, This will be the first syllable of the name of the person whose birthday it is. Play this F chord for the whole measure, through the next ""Hap - py"" syllables.


An F major chord is played like this:
F MajorHigh E string: First fret (1)B string: First fret (1)G string: Second fret (2)D string: Third fret (3)A string: Third fret (3)Low E string: First fret (1)


Note that the chord above is a barre chord. This means that it uses the side of your index finger to fret all of the strings on the first fret. Beginners can find this difficult to do, so, if you can't quite get it to sound right, try this alternative instead:
""Easy"" F MajorHigh E string: First fret (1)B string: First fret (1)G string: Second fret (2)D string: Third fret (3)A string: Not played (X)Low E string: Not played (X)



, Play C on the ""birth - day"" syllables and G on the ""to"" syllable. In other words, two beats of C and one beat of G.


You may have trouble switching between these two chords so quickly if you're a beginner. Practice this measure by itself and don't give up as you want your finger motions to eventually become second-nature.

, For effect, let this final chord ring out.


Congratulations! You've just played ""Happy Birthday."" Practice the steps above until you've gotten the hang of it, then try singing over the chords!

, The melody to ""Happy Birthday"" is a simple one that everyone knows, so practicing it is easy and you'll know right away if it sounds wrong. The first two notes (the ones that correspond to ""Hap - py"") are both Gs.


The note you'll want to start with here is the one you get by playing the open G string. Play one note for each syllable in ""Hap - py,"" like this:
High E string:----------------B string: ---------G string: 0-0---------D string:--------A string:--------Low E string:--------


For this section, since there's not an easy way to represent staff music or tablature on WikiHow, we're going to proceed measure-by-measure. For a traditional inscription of the melody, visit a site like Guitarnick.com or start-playing-guitar.com.,


Each beat gets one note, like this:
High E string:--------B string: ----------1G string: 2--0D string:--------A string:--------Low E string:--------



,


B gets two beats and the two G eighth notes get one, like this:
High E string:--------B string: 0------G string: --------0-0D string:--------A string:--------Low E string:--------



,


The third measure is the same as the first, except that the final note is two frets up, like this:
High E string:--------B string: ----------3G string: 2--0D string:--------A string:--------Low E string:--------



,


The fourth measure is the same as the second, except that the first note is one fret up, like this:
High E string:--------B string: 1------G string: --------0-0D string:--------A string:--------Low E string:--------



,


The G you start on here is an octave higher than the G you've used earlier. The next two notes descend from this G, like this:
High E string:3--0--B string: --------------1-G string: ---------D string:--------A string:--------Low E string:--------



,


The B you start on here is made with the open B string and the final Fs are played as eighth notes on the high E string, like this:
High E string:---------1-1-B string: 0--------G string: ----2------D string:--------A string:--------Low E string:--------



,


Start on the open high E string here, like this:
High E string:0------------------B string: -----1--3------G string: ----------D string:--------A string:--------Low E string:--------



,, Above, we've used straight eighth notes for each of the ""Hap - py""s in the song — that is, eighth notes where each note is played for the same amount of time. However, if you pay attention while you sing the song, you'll probably notice that the eighth notes aren't actually played straight. Rather, they're swung, which means that the first eighth note is a little longer than the second. To play the song more accurately, the ""hap"" syllable should be played for a little more time and the ""py"" syllable should be played for a little less time than if you were using straight eighths.


In musical terms, we'd say that the first eighth note in each ""Hap - py"" is a dotted eighth note and the second is a sixteenth note.


, Try singing the song aloud to yourself again. Odds are, you'll naturally stretch out each ""you"" and the last syllable of the birthday boy/girl's name. This is a good thing, as it lends the song a little more of an emotional, dramatic quality. If you're not already doing this when you play the song on guitar, try adding it to your playing and it should come easily.


In musical terminology, holding a note at the end of a piece or phrase in this way is called a fermata., The notes and chords above don't make up the only way to play ""Happy Birthday"". In fact, there are several different sets of chords and notes (called ""keys"") that you can use to play this song. Though a discussion of what exactly a key is is beyond the scope of this article, it's easy to find music for ""Happy Birthday"" in different keys by using a search engine query like ""Happy Birthday guitar keys.""


For example, here's another way to play ""Happy Birthday:""
Happy Birthday
Hap-py |(G) birth - day to |(D) you. Hap-py | birth - day to |(G) you. Hap-py | birth-day dear |(C) (na-ame). Hap-py |(G) birth - day (D) to |(G) you.



, In the examples above, we've only used major (happy-sounding) chords. In reality, you can also add chords called 7 chords to this song to give it a slightly more complex, almost bluesy feel. If you want to do this, simply change the chord in the third measure and the second chord in the seventh measure to the 7 version of that chord so that a D becomes a D7, a G becomes a G7, and so on.


For example, here is the original chord progression for ""Happy Birthday"" from the top of this article with 7 chords substituted in:
Happy Birthday
Hap-py |(C) birth - day to |(G) you. Hap-py |(G7) birth - day to |(C) you. Hap-py | birth-day dear |(F) (na-ame). Hap-py |(C) birth - day (G7) to |(C) you.


For reference, a G7 chord is played like this:
Open G7High E string: First fret (1)B string: Open (0)G string: Open (0)D string: Open (0)A string: Second fret (2)Low E string: Third fret (3)



"
"
Choose instrumentation.,
Utilize the common chord progression for the introduction.,
Use a different chord progression for the verse.,
Go back to the original chord progression for the chorus.,
Work on tempo.",How to Play Mad World," Playing this song will be different based on what instruments the musicians are using. In many variations of ""Mad World"" the major instrument is the piano. However, for other musical presentations, the guitar is the lead instrument. Think about which instruments are best for a specific rendition of this song.;
, Sheet music for the song shows the intro as being composed of two chords: F minor and B flat major. Playing these two alternately will provide the back-and-forth kind of sound featured in the introduction to ""Mad World.""

, When the song is played with F minor as the base chord, the verse chord progression would be from F minor to A flat, E flat and B flat and back to F minor.


Think about alternatives for the key of the song. Changing the key can make the song sound a bit different. For instance, some versions of sheet music for ""Mad World"" use the chords E minor and A major for the intro. Being able to change keys for a song quickly is part of what makes a musician more experienced and professional, and it's worth putting some time into the study of relative chord progressions in order to be able to effectively change keys.







, For example, if using the introduction chords F minor and B flat major, return to this same chord alternation for the chorus.


Listen to the way the alternating chords match the vocal chorus line: ""I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad ..."" Here, the timely resolution back to F minor is part of what makes the song feel a certain way. Getting this feeling right is part of playing this song well.







, The pace of the chords is very important for ""Mad World."" Again, listen to the lyrics and try to make the pace of musical play match the vocals and the overall ethos of the song. Getting the sound right will evoke associations with the original version and make your version sound good.

Use the bridge chords as your outro.",How to Play Seven Nation Army on Guitar," This is the iconic set of notes that the song begins with, played on the bass. The exact same riff is repeated through the verse and chorus, though Jack White plays the notes as power chords on the guitar. If you can learn the basic riff, however, you can add the chords in later with ease. The bass riff looks like:


G|-------------------------------------|
D|----------5---------------------------|
A|--7--7------7-5-3-2-----------------|
E|--0-----------------------------------|

In the real song, this is only a bass guitar riff. But you can crank up the distortion or use an octave pedal to mimic the sound on an electric guitar.
;
, Get used to moving your whole hand fluidly across the guitar to master the above riff. Use your index finger to fret as much as possible instead of switching fingers -- you'll need your ring and pinkie free to make chords later on.


Listen closely and you can hear Jack White sliding around the guitar. It is most pronounced right before he launches into the riff, sliding into that 7th fret note.


, If you were to play the song with just an acoustic guitar, for example, you'd need to know the chord melodies. But these chords could be used for any cover or version -- look at Marcus Collins version, which uses rhythm guitar in the verse where the original has none. To play chord melodies, simply play the following chords -- each chord times up to the same note in the bass riff above.


E (7th fret, 5th string)

G (5th fret, 4th string)

D (5th fret, 5th string)

C (3rd fret, 5th string

B (2nd fret, 5th string

These can be played as straight chords or powerchords., To get a real ""White Stripes"" sound from your guitar, your amp needs to be adjusted a little. Don't worry, you're not opening anything up, just change the settings a little. You'll need quite a bit of gain, try turning that up to 8. To even that out, keep your treble all the way up to 7 or 8 too. Keeps the mids at 5 while the bass should be pumped up to 8. If your amp has an effect called ""Presence"", turn that up to 8 too.

, Power chords are simple 2-finger chords used for big, brash, and quick songs. If you've never made them, they are actually easy to build. Start with your index finger on any fret on the top two strings -- use the first note of the Seven Nation Army riff (7th fret, 5th string) to start. Now, simply place your ring finger one string and two frets down, on the 9th fret, 4th string. Only play these two strings -- this is your power chord


For even bigger, better chords, add your pinky on the string and fret below your ring finger (9th fret, 3rd string), so your final chord has three notes.
The note your index finger is on determines the chord. Since the note in the example is an E, this is an E power chord.

, This is the section that begins with the words (in the first verse, at least) ""and the message in my eyes..."" As he says this you should:


Hit a G power chord (3rd fret, 6th string) for one full measure.
Switch to an A power chord (5th fret, 6th string) or an open A (2nd fret, 2nd-4th strings) for one full measure.

, You want to start with one big strum, followed up by a shorter one. In case you've forgotten, an E power chord looks like this:


e|--X--
B|--X--
G|--X--
D|-(9)-
A|--9--
E|--7--

, After the second, quicker strum, jump quickly up to the 10th fret and strum it once. This chord takes the place of the 5th fret, 3rd string shown in the bass riff above.


e|--XX--
B|--XX--
G|--XX--
D|-(12)-
A|--12--
E|--10--

, From here on out, you'll be repeating the bass riff, just with power chords. Hit the E one more time on you way back up the guitar.

, Your next chord is another power chord, the 5th fret on the 5th string.


e|--X--
B|--X--
G|--X--
D|-(7)-
A|--7--
E|--5--

, Keep on following the bass riff. The chord is still the same shape. This is a C power cord, sometimes called a C5.


e|--X--
B|--X--
G|--X--
D|-(5)-
A|--5--
E|--3--

, The last chord is the B and is located on the 2nd fret of the 5th string. Once you've hit this, there is a brief pause before you simply repeat the chords once more for the chorus.


e|--X--
B|--X--
G|--X--
D|-(4)-
A|--4--
E|--2--

, ""Seven Nation Army"" is simple, and doesn't have any vigorous strumming. After learning all of the power chords, you need to learn the actual song. There are three parts: a verse, a chorus, and a bridge. Listen to the song to see how the music changes during these parts.


The Verse is only bass and drums. You can, however, play the chords of the song, or play the bass riff on guitar.
The bridge is simply your way in and out of the chorus. At the end of the verse, right before jumping into the power chords, play the two chord bridge. You also play it after the chorus, right before going into the verse again.
The chorus is your power chord riff. This exact same riff is also played behind the guitar solo.

, The guitar solo in ""Seven Nation Army"" isn't technically difficult. But rhythmically it is almost in perfect tune with the iconic bass riff from the beginning of the song. This this powerful, plodding, and deliberate rhythm is key to making the solo sound nice.


If you need, review and learn the bass line before the solo. It is easy enough and will help immensely.

All you're doing is taking the following sets of notes, and putting them through the same rhythm as the bass solo.
Start part one of the solo on the 9th fret, 3rd string. The solo has two parts -- both of which follow the style of the bass riff. The first half starts on the 9th string, playing the 9th string repeatedly in place of the held root note in the bass riff. After leaving the 9th, keep playing the rest of the notes as if they were the bass guitar. Play this riff twice.

|G|-----9~~--9-9-9-9/12b--11~---9~~-9-12-14-12--12-12/14-12-11-----

, This riff is when the guitar really starts to squeal. Keep practising, playing along with the song, to get the feel for the bends. Note, as well, how much vibrato (when you ""shake"" a note, as indicated by the ""~"") is used to give the notes flavor and attitude.


|e|-----12--12-15-12-12-15b--14~~----12--12-15-17-15--15-15/17-15-14~~-----

, The last little section of the song sounds great if you play the B-string occasionally as well, barring both strings on the same fret. This can add some of the body and power to your solo as you're playing, helping you capture some of the attitude of the original.


|e|-----12--12-14-12-12-15b-15~~----12--12-14-12-12-14-12.

, Once the solo is over, quickly play the 13th and 12th frets on the B-string (2nd string). Then jump into a quiet rendition of your bridge -- the G and A power chords-- to transition back into the verse.


If you know how, palm mute these last two chords for the best effect."

Learn the Major Scales


Be familiar with the major scale pattern: Whole, whole, half, whole, whole, whole, half.,
As with any major scale, you begin with the root.,
Next, we take a whole step to the 2nd fret on the ""A"" string or a ""B"" note.,
Then another whole step to the 4th fret on the ""A"" string or the ""C#"" note.,
Then a half step from ""C#"" to the open D string.

,
Then a whole step again to the 2nd fret on the ""D"" string or the ""E"" note.,
Another whole step to the 4th fret on the ""D"" string or the ""F#"" note.,
Another whole step to the 1st fret on the ""G"" string or the ""G#"" note.,
Lastly, one more half step to the 2nd fret on the ""G"" string or the ""A"" note.",How to Play the A Major Guitar Scale," (Please see wikiHow's Major Scale article);
,


On the guitar, with standard tuning, this would be an open ""A"" string.
There are, of course, many ways to play a single scale on the guitar. This article will concern itself with playing the ""A"" major scale in first position.

Learn the motion.,
Use a prop before using the cello.,
Apply the motion.,
Control the motion.",How to Do Vibrato on a Cello1," Vibrato comes from the up and down motion of the arm, not from the rotation of the wrist or hand, but you do want the arm to rotate (this is different from the violin or viola). This motion is similar to opening a jar, and then closing it quickly. It is very helpful to learn this away from the cello before applying it. See next step to help with this.;
, To learn the motion of vibrato, it is helpful to use a film canister to serve as a rattler.


Fill a film canister or a pillbox with pebbles, rice, or anything else that will rattle.






Simply hold this in your left hand. Then support your elbow as if you were playing the cello, and move your hand up and down vertically as if you were hitting something.






Do this for 10 minutes a day until it feels natural. It may take several days.






Practice a lot. To help with control, try making this motion faster/slower, and wider/narrower. When you feel comfortable, transfer back to the cello again.







, Now, apply this motion to your practice, of scales especially, until it becomes a natural motion. Try playing a scale first with one vibrato (maybe slow and wide), then try again playing it another way (fast and wide), then another and so on.


When first applying vibrato to your playing, try only using it on scales at first. Scales are simple so it is easier to concentrate on getting the correct motion.







, Be able to get a whole variety of different vibratos from wide and slow to narrow and fast. Vibrato should not just be an on/off motion. Different characters require different vibratos.

"
"
Put your thumb behind the fingerboard and put you middle finger on a note.,
Slowly use a glissando between the notes but not too much.,
Practice doing this faster.",How to Do Vibrato on a Cello2," Start with you middle finger, because that is an easy one.

, Glissando means sliding and to move to the next note of the scale instead of picking up your finger.

, Keep at it until it sounds good.

"
Think about why you want to play the cello.,
Have a goal.,
Get a teacher.,
Learn basic notes, techniques, and rhythm Start very slowly, because the beginning is the most important part of your learning.,
Practice regularly (every day), and take breaks if you get uncomfortable.,
Go to lessons and have 30 minutes a week to start, then go to 45 minutes, an hour, etc.,
Take advantage of all performance opportunities at school and in your community.

,
Always practice scales and arpeggios.,
Alternatively, you can practice etudes as well.,
Join a community orchestra.,
Learn the notes and get their intonation perfect 100% of the time, then learn vibrato effectively.",How to Play the Cello," Do you want to be like your friends? Are your parents forcing you to learn? These are not good reasons. You must have a strong desire to be a good cellist, or you will waste a lot of time, money and effort.;
, Be it a certain piece you want to play, a concert you want to play in, a competition you want to enter, or an orchestra or school you want to get into, having a goal will help you through practicing and give you motivation.

, Ask your musician friends' parents how they found their teacher, or look in the yellow pages. Go see at least 3 teachers to get a feel of how they work, and then choose the one that best suits your schedule and your way of learning. Bring a parent to your lessons for the first year so you can have an outside perspective of your posture, sound and position while you are practicing at home.

, If you learn wrong, it will take years to fix bad habits. Some bad habits can even be physically injurious. Please, start slowly., During the first week, you may want to only practice for 15 minutes at a time: your fingers won't be used to the string and will hurt a little at first. Remember that it is always better to spread out your practicing rather than practicing a lot two or three days a week.

, You can also add a second lesson per week. Depending on the teacher, lessons can range from $25 to $100 or higher.

,, People tend to concentrate on what they are playing instead of how they are playing it, and scales are a good way to really think about it. Scales are also a sort of stretch before you play a song. Practice Technical Work and take theory classes. Do exams. Exams help you evolve and give you a goal to reach every few months.

, These are short pieces (look for Krane books or Schroeder and, in more advanced stages look for Popper and Duport) that test you on not only scalar technique and knowledge but bow stroke, vibrato, rhythm, tone, and many other aspects of the cello. In combination with regular piece music and scales, you can help improve yourself and mix up your practice schedule as well.

, Orchestras are great for learning theory if you do not want to take classes, and teach rhythm, intonation, and how to play with other musicians. If you work hard, an orchestra will be very rewarding because you will move up and one day become the Principal.

, Vibrato livens up the music beautifully and warms the tone.

Try the different combinations of positions.",How to Shift on a Cello," Make sure that your arm and fingers are curved. Check your thumb that it is supporting the cello but not squeezing it tightly. If you are squeezing it too tightly, relax your hand and gently place your thumb at the neck of the cello.
, Only hover them over the strings. Try not to get too close to the strings as the shifting movement will be much harder, however, having your fingers too high above the strings will make it hard to accurately place your fingers., This action must be done smoothly so that there is less tension in your arm., Gradually increase the speed of shifting to each position. Avoid yanking your arm towards the position. Keeping your thumb loose helps you shift easier., Make sure you are completely accurate. Press all four fingers down and play the D string. Lift your fingers off one by one to see if each note it in tune. Once you have checked and the notes are in tune, place your hand gently on the D string in first position again., Your third finger should be on the G# note and your fourth finger should be on the A note. This A is the same A as your open string A. Press down all your fingers in this position and play.

To test if your second position on the D string is correct, play your open A string and compare. They both should sound the same.

, Lift your fourth finger to see what G# sounds like, then lift your third finger to listen to G and so on. If the notes are out of tune, adjust your fingers and try again., Remember to move your thumb with your fingers. Ensure that you are not squeezing too tightly. Remember to lift your fingers slightly first then move. Avoid sliding up and down the strings with your fingers as it is very slow. Always keep your fingers and arm curved over., Improve your speed and accuracy. Practice shifting to second position on the other strings too:

In second position on the A string, the notes are (first to fourth finger):

C#; D; D#; E


G string:

B; C; C#; D (this D is the same D as your open string D)


C string:

E; F; F#; G (this G is the same G as your open string G)



, Move your hand so that your first finger is on the G note and your second finger is on the G# note. Your third finger should now be on the A note and your fourth finger should be on the B♭ note., Lift your fourth finger up and play. This should be the A note. To check if it is accurate, play your open A string to compare. Then, lift your third finger up and play (this should be the G# note) and so on. If the notes are out of tune, adjust your fingers and try again., Always check your thumb. Do not make it a habit to keep your thumb in one spot while shifting as this will cause problems., Always adjust your fingers if the sound is out of tune.

In third position, the notes on the A string are:

D; D#; E; F


G string:

C; C#; D; E♭


C string:

F; F#; G; A♭



, Practice slowly and gradually increase the speed. Try shifting from:

First to third position
Second to third position
Third to first position
Third to second position

, Check to see if all your fingers are accurately placed. Adjust your fingers to the correct position if necessary., Your third finger should be on the B note and your fourth should be on the C note., Note that the C note is the same C note on the A string in first position. Lift your fourth finger up and play, then lift your third finger up and play and so on. Adjust your fingers if the notes are out of tune.,

In fourth position, the notes on the A string are:

E; F; F#; G

"
Listen to a concert A.,
Play your A string.",How to Tune a Cello to Concert A1," Concert A (A4 in scientific pitch notation) is a pitch that is an octave above the A string on your cello.

Concert A is, however, the pitch of the violin A string, and will be what the concertmaster plays when the orchestra tunes. If you are in a full orchestra, you will most likely tune to this pitch given by the principal oboist. Don't let the different timbres of the instruments throw you off.
This pitch is also 440 Hz on a note generator. Many metronomes and tuners have note generators with this specific pitch to help you tune. Tone generators are also available online, though every musician should have a metronome as part of their kit.
Keep in mind that different orchestras may set concert A to a different pitch - for example, 442 Hz is common in some parts of Europe.

, Bow it softly but smoothly. Adjust the fine tuner (or peg, if it's really out of tune) until it is in tune.

If your arms are long enough, you can adjust the fine tuner with your left hand while simultaneously bowing. This takes practice to sustain the smoothness of the bowing.
To play concert A, simply play that harmonic. Find the pitch on the A string (3rd finger 5th position), and instead of pressing all the way, lightly touch the string. The sound will be lighter and more airy, but you may be able to hear the intonation better.

"
"
Find the second harmonic of the D string.,
Alternate between the harmonics on the A and D strings.,
Alternate between the harmonics on the D and G strings.,
Alternate between the harmonics on the G and C strings.",How to Tune a Cello to Concert A2," The second harmonic, by its very nature, has two positions on the D string; you will use the one located in 1st finger 4th position (A3, or the A below concert A, if you press down).

Lightly press this note to obtain concert A.;
, If they are not the same pitch, then the D string will be flat or sharp. Adjust accordingly until they are in tune., The G string harmonic producing a D3 is found in the same place as where you lightly pressed the D string. All you need to do is to play that harmonic a string down., When these harmonics are in tune, then your cello should be in tune and ready to go."
"
Play the A and D strings at the same time.,
Check if the D string is flat or sharp.,
Continue with the lower strings.",How to Tune a Cello to Concert A3," Use a moderate sound and a smooth bow. With good ear training, perfect fifths are easy to hear, while out-of-tune fifths can be picked out by recognizing the dissonant vibrations and a sound that is not quite right., Adjust your D string until the A and D strings produce a perfect fifth.

Assuming your A string is in tune, press the D string near the nut to slightly sharpen the pitch, and adjust as needed. If a perfect fifth results from doing this, then the D string is flat.
Likewise, if you need to press the A string near the nut to obtain a perfect fifth, then the D string is sharp.

, As with tuning by harmonics, this relies on your ear to make sure that your strings are actually in tune - otherwise, the errors accumulate as you get lower.

A perfect fifth of the G and C strings may be a bit difficult to hear at first, especially if your strings are not high quality or if you are tuning in an orchestra with other cellos. Use harmonics if needed.

Finally, be inventive.",How to Play Guitar Like Bernard Butler," Bernard was the lead guitarist for the band from their inception, but most of their finished material featuring his guitar work was released between 1992-1994. This includes their debut Suede, the follow-up Dog Man Star, the stand alone single Stay Together, and the respective B-sides and rarities, many of which can be found on the album Sci-Fi Lullabies. This will give you a good idea of the techniques and styles he uses, and the further you delve into the back catalogue, the more you will notice a common theme and style that recurs in the guitar work.;
, Bernard used a Gibson Les Paul during the band's early years, and regularly live on songs such as 'Animal Nitrate' and 'Metal Mickey'. He has also utilised a Fender Telecaster, Gibson J-200, Vox Phantom and Fender Electric XII, however, the electric guitar most commonly associated with him is a cherry red 1960 Gibson ES-355TD-SV, which he has continued to use throughout his career. His primary amp would appear to be a Vox AC30, which has been used extensively throughout his career. Any of this equipment would be useful in replicating Bernard's guitar sound, but is not necessary. Brands such as Epiphone offer more affordable versions of the Les Paul and 355, and any cheaper Vox amp would help recreate the cleaner, jangly tones on the Suede records.

, Bernard used two distinct guitar sounds for nearly every Suede song he played one:


The first is a clean-ish, jangly tone, quite similar to Johnny Marr's (one of Bernard's guitar heroes) signature sound, but with a flavour of it's own that is very characteristic of his regular amp, the Vox AC30. This sound can be hear most prominently during the verses of 'Metal Mickey' and 'Animal Lover'. The amp settings that I usually use for this tone are Gain - 5, Bass - 1, Middle - 7, Treble 10, Reverb - 3.
The second is a fuzzy, over-driven tone that Bernard often uses to thicken the lead parts, such as the one in 'Stay Together'. For this he used a Boss DS-2 Turbo distortion, and the settings that I use for this on the pedal are Gain - 10, Tone - 7 and Distortion - 5. This, or any similar pedal will give you the distorted fuzz that characterised the explosive Suede choruses.

, One of Butler's finest moments is the introduction to 'Animal Nitrate'. The track begins with eerie ambient sounds, followed a distinctive riff in the key of B minor, which is then boosted by a roaring flanger effect, helping to introduce the song in style. Bernard seemed to favour using an effects pedal for the introduction of a song, such as a chorus effect on the intro to 'We Are The Pigs'. Adding an effect can give a guitar part an extra edge that sets it apart from others. However, a simple crunch tone can embellish an intro, as demonstrated in the raunchy power chords that open Suede's debut single, 'The Drowners'.

, Bernard often broke down and embellished chords for many of the songs, a great example of which would be the intro/verse of 'Metal Mickey'. The chords for the verse are A, G, D, C and A. However, rather than strumming them freely, he broke down each chord and embellished it by turning it into a series of guitar licks. If you listen closely to the song, whilst the first A chord is strummed in it's entirety, the following chords are represented with a series of bass notes and fast licks. This is a recurring style that shows up regularly on the Suede album, and is present in other songs such as 'My Insatiable One' and 'So Young'. In conclusion, when trying to emulate Bernard's rhythm style, it's best to break things into open chord parts, rather than just hammering out barre chords. When it comes to his guitar style, the more intricate and interesting sounding it is, the better!

, Whilst Bernard gives texture to the verses of a song with jangly rhythm parts, the chorus more often than not features a melancholic, melodic counterpart to the vocal. Emphasized with a fat fuzzy tone, these parts sometimes copy the vocal part, or simply compliment the vocals with an alternate melody. Some of the best examples of this would be the over-driven chorus of 'So Young', which features a minor pentatonic melody, and 'Stay Together', which departs from the quiet arrangement of the verse with a bluesy, fuzzy guitar part.

, Whilst he often used standard pentatonic scales to construct solos, such as those found in 'Metal Mickey' and 'Animal Lover', in other songs he was prone to experimentation, and literally 'thinking outside the box', namely the pentatonic scale boxes. The best examples of this would be the 'Animal Nitrate' solo, which recalls the chorus part, but also ventures into an almost chromatic series of notes, and the solo in 'The Asphalt World', which favours melody over strict scales to complement the minor sound of the song. One of his most memorable, the solo in 'We Are The Pigs' combines both methods, by sticking to regular pentatonic scales, but still with a strong sense of melody. Basically, as long as it sounds interesting, don't worry about soloing within 'the rules': remember, rock music is all about breaking them!

, Bernard demonstrated a wide variety of guitar tricks and techniques during his time in Suede, some of which were purely musical, and some of which contributed to his guitar showmanship. These include, but are not limited to:


Pick slides (Moving, Metal Mickey)
Half step and full step bends
Legato (employed in a variety of ways)
Trills (Animal Lover)
Bending the guitar neck to raise or lower the pitch of a chord (Used memorably just before the Animal Nitrate solo)
Tremolo Picking (Stay Together, Moving)
Triplets (Stay Together)
Arpeggios within a solo (My Insatiable One)
Double stops (Metal Mickey)

, As mentioned previously, Bernard often used effects to enhance his guitar sound. Most of the songs on the first album feature only a small handful of effects, compared to the large array that Bernard used on the second, Dog Man Star. Here are several of the effects he used, and examples/the songs he used them most prominently on:


Distortion/Fuzz - 'Animal Lover', 'This Hollywood Life'.
Flanger - 'Animal Nitrate', 'My Dark Star', 'Metal Mickey'
Phaser - 'My Dark Star', 'Animal Nitrate'
Chorus - 'Stay Together', 'We Are The Pigs', 'The Asphalt World'
Wah Wah - 'The Asphalt World'

, What sets Bernard Butler apart from other guitarists of his era, is that he epitomized the role of the lead guitarist. Rather than just strumming chords, he used the guitar as his voice, and his guitar work was as equally important to the early Suede era as Brett Anderson's vocals. Butler broke the boundaries with the instrument, and was arguably the most accomplished lead guitarist to emerge out of the Britpop movement.

Vertically, the strings are numbered 1 through 6, from highest pitch to lowest.
Horizontally, the numbering is based on the fret positions.
Note that when the directions say ""put your first finger on the 3rd fret,"" that means you actually place your finger between the 2nd and 3rd fret. It's the string itself that needs to be in contact with the 3rd fret.Use this mnemonic to remember which note each string is tuned to, from lowest to highest:Eat All Day, Get Big Easy., Take a look at your left hand, and imagine you have numbers stamped on your fingers. Your index is 1, your middle finger is 2, your ring finger is 3, and your pinky finger is 4. Your thumb we will call ""T,"" but you will not be using it for chords in this article.








, The first chord we will cover is a C chord—one of the most basic chords in music. Before we do, let's break down just what that means. A proper chord, whether played on a piano, a guitar, or sung by well-trained mice, is simply three or more notes sounded together. (Two notes is called a ""diad,"" and while musically useful, is not a chord.) Chords can also contain far more than three notes, but that's well beyond the scope of this article. This is what a C chord looks like on the guitar:









The lowest note is the 3rd fret of the A string: C
The next note up is played on the 2nd fret of the D string: E
Note there is no finger on the G string. This string remains ""open"" when strumming a C.
The highest note is played on the 1st fret of the B string: C
The highest and lowest strings on the guitar are not played for the basic C major chord.

, Play each note note in the chord, from low to high, one at a time. Take your time and be deliberate: press down firmly on the fret, and pluck the string. Let the note ring for as long as you can, then move to the next note:









Press your 3rd finger onto the 3rd fret of the A string, as indicated above, pluck, and let it ring until it fades out. You just played a C note.
Press your 2nd finger onto the 2nd fret of the D string, then do the pluck-and-ring to play an E.
Break time! Simply pluck the open, un-fingered G string.
Press your 1st finger on the 1st fret of the B string, and let that C note sound loud!
Play the notes, one at a time, for a few times. When you're ready, sweep your pick or fingers across all four middle strings quickly. You've just played a C chord!
It may sting a little the first few times you do it, but as you develop calluses, the pain goes away.

, Playing a C chord is nice, and it's definitely a gateway chord that will lead you into more interesting musical territory, but there's much more to music than that! Here are two other chords commonly used when playing in C Major. F, and G. Play a basic F chord like this:









The notes in an F chord are F, A, and C. Note that the F and the C are being played by the same finger: the first finger is placed across the 1st fret of both the 1st and 2nd strings.
Generally, chords are built so that the lowest note is the root of the chord, but in this case, the F is being sounded on the 1st fret of the 1st string. This is called an ""inversion.""

, You can an F in the root by playing the F on the D string: the 3rd fret up, played with your third finger. You may notice the chord doesn't sound a lot different, just ""fuller.""








, Like the C and the F, the G chord is one of the Big Three in the C major scale. There are many ways to play it, and we'll show you two. The first way is easy: it's the exact same fingering as the extended F chord, only moved up two frets:








, Here's a way to play the G chord with only one finger:








, Now that you know the three basic chords in the key of C, put them together, and perhaps you'll recognize about a zillion popular songs. Strum C four times, followed by F, two times, then G, two times, then back to C.









Note that after each chord is a Roman numeral. These indicate what position the root note of the chord is on the scale—regardless of fingering. Once you know the basic chords in all the keys, it's easier to just show a chart than to have the chord spelled out every time.
Practice that until your fingers are tired, then take a break, but come back: we'll also show you the basic chords in E and A!

, The three chords to learn here are E Maj (I), A Maj (IV), and B Maj (V). Here's the E chord:









This is one of the easier chords to play, once you have your calluses built up. You can play all the strings at once. Crank up a Marshall stack to 11 with this chord, hit it hard, and you'll feel the beginnings of being a rock hero!

, This is another ""big chord,"" sonically. There are several ways to play this. You can use one finger across the 2nd fret of the B, G, and D strings (playing C#, A, and E, respectively), or any other combination of fingers. For this example, we'll use the 4th finger on the B string, 3rd finger on the G string, and 2nd finger on the D string.









As you get better at playing, you will understand that moving quickly from one chord to another sometimes results in odd fingerings that still work. The key is to make the most efficient use of your fingers, and once you kick off the training wheels, don't be afraid to experiment.

, You can play this one easy, or play this one hard. The easy way is shown with the black numbers. You can add the additional note, show by the gray number.








, Here's another short strumming pattern to try out in the key of E:









Try varying your strumming pattern, too: don't just stick to the lines on the paper.

, You're already two thirds of the way there! The key of A consists of A in the first position (I), D in the fourth position (IV), and our old powerhouse friend E in the dominant fifth position (V). Here's how to play the D chord:









Note the first finger across the first three strings: this is the beginning of a ""barre"" chord. A full barre chord uses one finger across all strings, and is often based on the basic forms shown in this article.

, This is useful when played along with the D and the E chords:








, Here's another Little Ditty to try out your new chords on:









Now, think of the Creedence Clearwater Revival song, Down on the Corner, and try it again!, Your ring finger goes on the top string, 3rd fret. The middle finger is for the 5th string, 2nd fret, and you pinky goes all the way to the bottom, on the 3rd fret of the 1st string. Strum all of the strings together to play the chord. If you want, add in the 3rd fret, 2nd string -- this not is not necessary, but makes a richer sounding chord.

, Place your ring finger up on the 5th string, 3rd fret. Then follow with your middle finger 4th string, 2nd fret -- note how this is the same beginning as a G chord, just moved down a string. Then end with your index finger on the 2nd string, 1st fret. Play all but the top string.

, This chord only requires the bottom four strings. Place your index finger on the 3rd string, 2nd fret. Your ring finger then goes on the 2nd string, 3rd fret, and your middle finger is the 1st string, second fret. You'll form a little triangle shape. Only strum these three strings and the 4th string -- the open D -- to sound out the chord.

Make an E-minor chord by simply removing your index finger, leaving the 3rd string open., An A major is one of your easiest chords -- simply use your index, ring, and middle finger to fret the 2nd fret on the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th strings. Play every string but the low-E string.

Find a good and reliable music store that specializes in stringed instruments (preferably that are handmade).,
Go to the store.,
Talk to the maker of the instrument, or his/her assistant(s).,
Test the cellos for the tonal quality.,
Get a good bow.,
Purchase some strings.,
Change the tailpiece and and the fine tuners if necessary, and purchase a wolf tone string eliminator/ gadget if encountering problems with wolf tones.

,
Choose a good secure case, preferably hard.",How to Choose the Right Cello for You1,";
, If you have a private teacher, see if they can come or have a student who is moving up a size, and see if you can buy theirs. They will usually know which cellos sound better.

, Talk about your price range and ask about the different types of cellos (high arched, low arched, two piece back, one piece back...).

, Even if your teacher says to choose a certain cello, but you prefer another cello, choose your cello. You should know that you will be using this cello for quite a long time. You wouldn't want to regret your decision. Remember not to be hasty, there are always other cellos in other great workshops.

, The cello may be great but the accompanying bow might not be. Ask one of the specialists and your teacher which one to get. Just like with the purchase of your cello, don't be hasty. Pick one you feel comfortable with, that feels balanced. Many people recommend getting a wooden bow, not a fiber glass one. Having two bows can also be convenient.

, If you buy a cello, the strings provided might not be the best fit. Ask a specialist and your teacher for their opinion. If no help is available, stick with the best brands, Obligato, Larsen and Jargar, or dominant for the less advanced. It is very important to have the cello well set-up to its advantage. A cello with great potential could sound poor with the wrong accessories. Do not buy Red Label strings, they are about $10 a string, but they are cheaply made and sound bad. Other types may be $40-$100 per string, but they are higher quality, last longer, and sound much better. Titanium string are more than $100 per string, but are excellent, and are extremely high quality. Make the investment if you can afford it and know that you are going to keep playing.

,, If you are using a cello that is smaller than a full sized, hard cases will be hard to come by. Also, good rosin is also important.

Locate a string instrument shop.,
Visit multiple places.,
Don't go alone.,
Beware of commission fees.,
Find out the prices.,
Try to get a discount.,
Purchase additional supplies.",How to Buy a Cello1," You can either check the phone book, use a search engine with keywords like ""string instruments shop near me,"" or ask fellow musicians or your teacher for advice, but try to find some local music shops that you can visit easily. If you live in a very rural area or a small town where there are few or no shops like this at all, it may seem tempting to get online to do your shopping, but ideally you will want to see and test any instrument you want to purchase first.


Make sure that the shop you go to has a good selection of cellos in various price ranges, both for students and professionals, present to try out.;
, Take your time and visit multiple stores if you can. There's nothing wrong with going to several locations to price compare and make sure there's not some great, undiscovered cello just around the corner. Particularly for such a large investment, you don't want to rush into a decision.


Find out what kinds of policies they have--can you rent-to-own? If you change your mind, do they have a trade-in policy in place? Do they allow you to finance or make payment plans? If so, find out additional details about these policies.

, Although you might feel like this is a decision you can make on your own, take your teacher or another trusted expert with you to the store; you will want them to examine the cellos with you, to listen to you play them, and to try them as well, so that you can be sure to pick a good cello. There may be things you will miss that they won't.

, Although most students are not aware of the practice, it is traditional within the industry that stores often give teachers a commission based on sales.This matters to you because the commission will almost assuredly be based on the amount of money the instrument costs. It could affect the advice that your teacher might give you for selecting a store or a particular brand.


Although there is nothing inherently unethical or illegal about this practice, you still deserve to know exactly what your money is paying for. Especially if you are hurting for money, talk with your teacher to find out if they do usually request a commission fee, and if so, if they'd be willing to waive it.
Before you go to the store, call ahead to find out if they participate in a commission fee program.
You can request that the store provide you with a written statement that no money or instruments changed hands for a commission so that you can be sure everything was done ethically., Only after you have thoroughly examined the cellos physically, but before you test anything out and start getting too attached to an instrument, it's time to find out the prices. At the low end of a good cello, you can expect to pay $2000 and closer to $5000 on the higher end for a beginner or student's instrument.


Instruments on the lower end of the cost range will usually be shop-made instruments: there's less attention to detail and some or much of the work will have been done by machines on an assembly line.
Some parts, like the tops and the backs which contribute considerably to the sound, will still be hand-made.
Instruments on the lower end of the scale are usually considered to be good for newer players as the sound is engineered to ""pop out."", Especially when you're talking about an instrument that costs thousands of dollars, every bit of money you can save counts. If the store does not participate in commissioner's fees and your teacher does not expect one either, you might ask if they can arrange for a 10% discount with the store., Once you have made up your mind, you will need to buy some additional items for your cello, because most of them do not come with a bow, strings, rosin, or extra tuning pegs. You will also have to replace these items from time to time as they will wear down from regular use. You may also have to purchase a hard case to protect your cello from potential damage if one is not included.Most cellists find it unnecessary to stockpile extra supplies; having one or two extra strings handy inside your case is usually plenty.
If this is your first cello, you may also need to pick up a tuning fork or an electric tuner.
Beginning students may also need a music stand, especially if they intend to learn to read music.

"
Find a good and reliable music store in your area.,
Go to the store.,
Find a helpful and friendly employee.,
Find out what size cello you need.,
Get a good case.,
Find out if your cello comes with a bow.,
Get some rosin.

",How to Choose the Right Cello for You2," Before going, find popular brands online and check the prices and the quality. The better cellos should be more expensive, but not necessarily.

, If you have a private teacher, see if they can come. They will usually know which brands are best.

, At most stores there will be employees just waiting to help customers like you.

, Different heights require different size cellos. The employee will probably have you try out a few different cellos. If a cello's C-peg comes to your left ear when you put the end pin out, it is a good size cello for you. Be sure you do not have to put the end pin out more than a foot or so, otherwise you will have to get a new cello very soon.

, A good case is one that will protect your new cello and have room for a bow, rosin, and a cleaning cloth without having any of them banging up against the cello. Most cases are just made of fabric but there are also harder cases that have wheels. These hard cases are usually more expensive, but are more durable than the fabric ones.

, Some cellos include a bow, some do not. If yours doesn't, you need to look at the bow selection. A good bow is not too long or too heavy.

,"
"
Choose a variety of instruments for inspection.,
Don't select cellos solely by brand.,
Be sure it's the correct size.,
Test it out.",How to Buy a Cello2," It's important that everything about your new cello look, feel, and especially sound appealing to you. If you only test one and assume that it's the perfect fit, you might miss something better. As you go along, do not pay attention to or ask about the price or brand of the instruments (yet!). Instead, ask your accompanying expert what they think of the sound, and try to pick a few that you'd like to physically test later after giving them all a thorough inspection.Have your teacher or selected expert inspect the cellos as well.

, Although it might be tempting to treat buying a cello the way you might buy clothes (finding the perfect brand name and sticking with it) this is probably not the best way to go about it. Although there are perhaps some brands that should be avoided, most that you'll find in a store should be generally reliable. Talk with experts you trust, and ask other cellists (who you may know through orchestra or lessons) about which brands they might recommend, but try to experiment with a range of cellos across different brands.

, The size of the cello that you will need is based primarily on height: cellists who are 5 feet or taller should generally be able to use a full-size cello, and those from 4 - 4½ feet tall should seek a half sized cello. Those who are in the middle between those two sizes will probably be more comfortable with the smaller cello.Due to the cost of a cello, you may wish to take into account whether or not there is a high likelihood you will continue to grow; most girls reach physical maturity around 15 years old, and boys around 16 or 17, and until then you may continue to grow.To determine if a cello is the correct size for you, sit in a chair from which you can comfortably rest your feet on the floor. Make sure your back is straight. Pull the endpin out a foot in length and allow the instrument to rest at a 45 degree angle against your chest. The top of it should come to the middle of your chest, with the peg for the C string situated near your left ear., Most shops will have a quiet area for you to test a cello out in, but some will also allow you to take it out of the store to test in other areas. If they do allow the latter, take advantage of this and test the cello in spaces you will commonly play--your home, wherever you take lessons or practice, the orchestra or band hall--to conduct additional tests.


You should be on the lookout for good tone and playability that is consistent whether the instrument is directly underneath your ear or all the way across a very large room. Unfortunately, there is no science to this step; you will have to make the choice based on your own instinct and your mentor's advice.One sign of a quality cello is the presence of the occasional wolf note, wherein the vibrations between the instrument and the string itself cancel each other out so quickly and repeatedly that the note stutters as it's made.

"
"
Examine the cellos' varnish.,
Check for quality wood.,
Inspect the flame.,
Check the fingerboard and neck.,
Look at the bridge.,
Test the strings.,
Inspect the fittings.,
Look at the sound post.",How to Buy a Cello3," A cello's varnish is more than just an aesthetic choice; it affects the way an instrument sounds and how that sound will continue to change over the years. If it is applied too heavily, the instrument will be unable to ""open up,"" preventing a musician from making notes that fully resonate and in fact diminish as you play. In this case, less varnish is considered more.The color of the varnish is purely personal preference; there is no agreed upon hierarchy among musicians.

, The kind of wood that the cello is made of matters: spruce tops and maple ribs and bottoms will produce good, quality sound. Meanwhile, laminated wood is probably best left for flooring due to its poor ability to conduct sound.Look for good grains: the ebony parts should ideally have very tight grains, so close they might actually appear to be perfectly smooth, and the spruce portions should have a grain that is tight in the center that grows wider toward the bouts.

, A good, dense flame (the horizontal bar of contrast underneath the varnish, located in the wood itself) is generally indicative of the wood's expense. Avoid wood that has an iridescent flame, wherein the light and dark bars change when the instrument is moved, as this is a sign that the flame has been artificially created., These pieces are interconnected, so it makes sense to check them both at the same time. Be sure the fingerboard feels smooth and dimple-, bubble-, and pit-free especially as you play. Do at test to make sure both components are even: with the scroll held next to your chin, look down the fingerboard to make sure the light is even all the way across.


A fingerboard that has been planed well will have a scoop at the mid point a string.
The neck should be treated with an oil finish instead of varnish., A bridge should be straight with a slight curve when viewed from the side, and the feet of it should exactly fit the instrument's belly. The cello's strings should fit into the grooves of the bridge, just deep enough to hold them securely without impeding vibration. An ideal bridge will be made of maple, have a tight grain, and be highly flamed., Be sure that you like the strings of the instrument by trying them out. If you or your mentor feel they're inappropriate, ask to try a different set. You also want to be sure that the strings are approximately .9 mm away from the fingerboard on the treble side and 1mm-1.4mm on the bass side., The fittings refer to pegs, endpins, and tailpieces as a group. Sometimes less scrupulous dealers may try to pass off an inferior cello by using fittings that look nice but are of poor quality.


Your pegs should not be too tight or too loose so that they turn and stay in tune easily. They shouldn't extend too far from the scroll, and the ends of them should be flush with the scroll head.
Endpins come in 18 or 20 inch sizes and a variety of metals; be sure yours suits your needs, sets firmly, and retracts without any issues.
Preferably you want a tailpiece that is made of ebony (plastic will resound less than it or composite materials) and come with a built-in fine tuner (as this reduces the weight), but the tailpiece absolutely must be the right size for the instrument.

, To locate the sound post, you must look through the f-hole. You want to be sure that it's uncracked, splinter free, and positioned correctly. It should be about a finger's width from the bridge, just behind the right bridge foot. It should not distort the f-hole's shape, shouldn't lean, or dimple the top of the cello."

Find an internet merchant that sells cellos like Cellos2Go, LindaWest.com, StringWorks, or FineViolins.com. You'll want to make sure that at least one person on the staff is a cello specialist.

, There are multiple communities online for buying and selling cellos as well as simply getting in touch with other cellists. Cello.org has a classifieds section, as do Uvcello.org and Usedviolins.com. Additionally, there are Facebook communities like Cello Community International that you can inspect. Be advised that the hosts of these communities do not screen, authorize, or in any way ensure the authenticity of the offers being made. , Auction sites are just about the last place you want to look for a musical instrument. It is much more likely that you will end up buying an item that is misleading and a waste of your money through these sites.If you absolutely see a cello that you are interested in buying on one of these sites, have someone with an experienced eye look at the listing's details, photos, and help you ask the sellers questions.


Many of the cheap cellos you might find on these sites are Chinese with setups that more experienced cellists will point out are bad (poor quality strings, improperly made bridges, tail pieces that are heavy and cheap). The listings may also include the words like ""master"" which is entirely misleading., Whether you are purchasing from a store website or an auction listing, beware prices that seem too good to be true. Although the exact number seems to be in dispute ($700 or $1000) the general consensus of experts is that the cheaper you go, the more likely you are to end up with a piece of junk that will experience problems down the line.


If the wood is uncured, the body could crack, come unglued, or the neck could separate from the body. Damages such as these would render the instrument unplayable even after having spent the extra money it will take to get it set up in a reputable shop, and you will have to pay more money to get it fixed later (if it can even be fixed)., In general, you want to be seek out a cello that has been around for a number of years and has already ""opened up"" its sound. But it's impossible to tell based on the listing's photos if the item is actually older because these days antiquing methods in virtually every country cellos are manufactured in are good enough to trick many amateurs. They can even put dings and scratches into the surface. , It is vitally important if you insist on doing your shopping online that you look for the information you need to make a correct choice. Find out when it was produced, if it's laminated or varnished, and what woods it's made of (plywood or spruce and maple). You want to avoid anything laminated, made of plywood, or too new; if you can't find the information to make a good assessment, contact the seller for more details.Some appraisers and sellers of violins like Celloconnection.com and Reuning.com will provide certificates of authenticity for owners; ask if the seller has one, or ask for them to get it appraised if they are claiming a special maker.Never make a purchase without knowing all the details. If a seller does not want to be honest about any of those details, you should find another place to buy a cello from.

, No matter where you choose to buy from, be sure to check what return policies they have in the event that the item is damaged in transit or, once it arrives, you decide it doesn't suit you. Additionally, you'll want to find out if there is any kind of warranty made by the seller.

, Just like when buying in a store, you will need to buy other items like a bow, case, extra strings, and the like for your instrument. Especially if you are seeking the cheapest cellos you can find you should not expect these items to be included unless they are specifically listed on the web site's listing.

, After you receive the item, you'll want to check to make sure that it didn't sustain any damages during transit. If any pieces have loosened or slipped off while the instrument was being shipped, be sure to get someone experienced, like your teacher or a shop, to put it together again immediately. You also need to make sure that the soundpost is in the correct position before you attempt to play or tighten the instrument's strings; doing otherwise may ruin the instrument."

Consider your budget.",How to Buy a Cello5," However skilled a very young musician may be, they are not the ideal candidate to buy a cello for. Young children are known for going through very rapid growth spurts: as elementary school students, they'll grow about 2½ inches in just a single year.Part of what determines the cello you should buy is your size, and fractional size instruments are notoriously difficult to resale.


To avoid having to buy a brand new cello again within six months or a year, consider renting a cello instead for those who need anything up to a ¾ size.

, Are you brand new to playing the cello? Are you sure you plan to continue playing the instrument in the years to come? Will playing the cello be a hobby for you, or do you have plans to pursue it professionally, or even semi-professionally? If you aren't sure if you will continue to play the cello for many years and do not intend to take it at least semi-professionally, then you may be better off renting a cello until you're sure.

, Cellos are extremely expensive: for a good fractional, teachers advise students spend no less than $700; a good, full-sized cello for an adult will be at least $2000.Anything less expensive than that is not a good instrument and should be avoided. If you cannot afford to spend that much on buying a cello, renting is the better alternative.

Strum all of the strings at once to play your E7.",How to Play an E7 Chord on Guitar1," The thickest string on the guitar is the 6th string. Since it is an E, the root note of an E7, you can leave this string open.









Remember that guitar strings count from the bottom up. The thinnest string is the 1st string, the thickest the 6th.

Shortcut: If you already know an open E-major chord you simply have to remove one finger to get an E7. Remove your finger from the 4th string, leaving it open. This is an E7.;
, The fifth string, the A, is fretted at the 2nd fret. If you remember E-major, the form so far is the same for your E7.








, This is actually the 7th note, but a higher octave of it than found in the major scale. If you don't care about the music theory, just leave this string open and move on.









Make sure that your ring finger doesn't mute this string accidentally.

, This is actually the last note you need to worry about -- the rest of the strings are left open. Again, this is the same note used in an E-major.








, All you need to do is play an E7 are these two notes and the other open strings. That's it. Strum all the strings to sound out your bluesy chord. The final chord looks like this in tab:

Use your index finger to barre over the open-E7 form to make any chord a seventh.,
Learn an E7 barre chord on the fifth fret.",How to Play an E7 Chord on Guitar2," This only works for chords starting on the sixth string, but this makes it easy to play a seventh chord anywhere. Imagine that the open strings were actually a barred fret -- they are all the same ""fret"" being sounded out in your chord. This means your other two fingers will make any chord ""barred"" a 7th. Since the next E begins on the 12th fret, your E7 barre chord would look like:









--12--
--12--
--13--
--12--
--14--
--12--

, When barring chords on the 5th string, you can use the same strategy to move your chord anywhere as the one used in the last step. However, you must use the form of an A7 chord, because an open A7 resembles a barre chord on the A string the same way an open E7 resembles a barre chord on the E string. For an E7, you'd start on the 5th string, 7th fret, an E, and play the following form:









--7--
--9--
--7--
--9--
--7--
--X--


Note: If you moved this form all the way to the open strings, so you only fret the second string on the 2nd and 4th strings, this is an open A7 chord.

Fade back into the verse to end the song.",How to Play Broken by Seether," ""Broken"" uses a variety of instruments, with electric guitar and violin out front, and a synthesized element along with drums in the background.;
, The acoustic guitar outlines the beginning of the track with basic chord-based, single-note work. Other instruments join in eventually.


Figure out the introduction chord progression. This same chord progression continues through the verse. In the key of E minor, which is a popular key for this song, the chord progression goes from E minor to C major three times, before going to D major and back to C major to resolve.
Master the picking style presented by the guitar player on the studio track. This style uses the top three strings as well as the bottom string of the fretboard in a particular melodic sequence. Sheet music or guitar tablature, or ""tabs,"" will help beginners see exactly how this picked guitar riff is played.

, As the guitar goes through its introduction, some light synthesizer music is heard in the background of the track.

, Where the vocalist first sings ""I'm broken�"" a different chord progression starts.


In the key of E minor, the chord progression for the chorus actually mirrors the introductory and verse chord progression. In the chorus, the guitar goes from C major down to E minor, before ending with a similar progression of C major to D major and back to C major.

, This will play through once, and then again as the female vocalist enters the song.

, Where the female vocalist comes in with ""The worst is over now�"" the drums begin. This gives additional heft to the last two-thirds of the track. Musicians have to figure out on their own when it's necessary to add extras like drums to their version.

,, In the studio version of ""Broken,"" the guitar solo during the interlude is minimal. It doesn't have to be that way for an original take on the song. Add electric guitar or anything else to fill in the song while the vocalists are silent.

, While the male and female vocals start again, musicians will want to add additional instrumentation to provide power for the end of the song.

, After the last chorus, the violin ramps up into a sequential riff that repeats three times. Again, musicians can provide their own take on this, depending on the availability of various instruments.

, This song relies on a partial verse at the end, where the drums and other background go still, for a softer resolution.

A basic A Major chord is simply a straight line with your pointer, middle, and ring fingers on the 2nd fret, playing the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th strings from the bottom. Looking down at the guitar in your lap and starting with the thickest string:









Leave the top string ""open,"" which means there is no finger on the fret.
Leave the next string open as well
Place your pointer finger on the next string between the first and second fret. The first fret is the one closest to the head of the guitar.
Place your middle finger between the first and second fret.
Place your ring finger between the first and second fret.
Leave the bottom most (high E) string open.;
, Guitar strings are not numbered from the top down. The bottom string, which is the thinnest string on your guitar, is the 1st string. The next one up is the 2nd, and so on until you get to the 6th string, the heaviest one. A helpful mnemonic for the order of the strings is Every Boy Gets Dinner At Eight, since the strings, from the bottom up, are EBGDAE.The 1st string, the thinnest, is the High E.

The 2nd string is a B.

The 3rd string is a G.

The 4th string is a D.

The 5th string is an A.

The 6th string, the thickest, is the Low E.


, Frets are the little metallic bars along the neck of the guitar. Pushing down a string in between two frets changes the note of the string, and each fret marks out the intervals between changing notes. The 1st fret is closest to the head of the guitar, the small piece at the end of the neck where all the strings are tied to the tuners. If a song calls for a note on the 1st fret, you would put your finger down in the space between the head and the first fret. If it calls for a note on the 2nd sting, 5th fret, you place you finger in the space between the 4th and 5th fret, on the 2nd string.









Each fret represents a half-step, musically. So the 6th string (top string), 4th fret is a G# (sharp), the 5th fret an A, the 6th an A sharp, etc.
Try and place your finger close to the fret for the best tone. For example, if you want to play a note on the 2nd fret, try and keep your finger as close to the second fret as possible without crossing over it or being on top of the fret. You are still between the 1st and 2nd fret, just closer to the 2nd.Tableture is guitar's version of sheet music, and simply uses the number of the fret instead of notes. It is incredibly helpful to learn if you want to learn the frets.

, You will try not to play the 6th string at all. The 5th string, when left open, is already an A note, so you want it in your chord.









Remember, the 5th and 6th strings are the top two strings.

, This note is an E. Chords are not made up of all the same note. They are made up, instead, of several tones that come together to make a richer, fuller sounding chord.








, This note is another A, but it is one octave (same note, but a different frequency) higher. Think of two singers, male and female, singing the same note at different tones, to get a beautiful harmony, and you'll understand octaves. For now, just know you need it in your chord.








, When done, you should have your three fingers in a line on the second fret.This note is a C#.









It is included because C# is the 3rd note of the A major scale, though this is not important for beginners to remember.

, This is another E, one octave higher than the E you are playing on the 4th string, and it rounds out the chord nicely.










Music Theory Note: E is the 5th note of the A Major scale. All major chords are made up of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd notes of a major scale. Thus, an A chord is nothing but A, E, and C#.

, Try not to play the thick, heavy 6th string on the top. This is your basic A major chord, known also as an Open A. If you are having trouble making it sound clean:









Practice curving your fretting fingers upwards so that the pads on your fingers don't drag on other strings and muffle them.
Press down firmly with the tip of your fingers. It may hurt for the first 2-3 days, but your fingers will quickly adapt.
Make sure you are close enough to the fret. At the very least, keep your fingers 3/4 of the way from the 1st fret to the 2nd., A barre chord, called such because you ""bar"" your index/pointer finger flatly across 5-6 strings at once, is used in many songs because you can move it quickly up and down the neck to get new chords. The chord is named after the topmost note that you play, which is also where you bar your finger. Since the 5th fret on the 6th string is an A, you start there for your A Major chord.








, This is your bar. Start with the top of your index finger pushing down on the 5th fret on the 6th string, which is the heavy string on top of the neck. Lay your finger down across every string so that all of them sound like you were playing on the 5th fret.









Pluck each string to practice your bar. You should hear a clear note all the way down the neck.

, The 5th fret of this string is an A, and it forms the basis of your chord. Leave it barred and move to the next string.








, Keep your bar solid, and place your ring finger two frets down on the 7th. You will be on the second highest string from the top. This is an E.








, One more string down, you'll need to stretch your pinky to cover up the 7th fret right beneath your ring finger. This note is an A.









Place your middle finger on the 6th fret of the 3rd string. The last note you need to grab is the C#, just one fret away from your bar, on the 3rd string.

If you've played an Open E chord, you'll recognize this as the same structure for your fingers. This is why this form is often called an ""E Form Barre Chord."", This is where practice and finger strength will come in handy. You pointer should press firmly enough into the bottom two stings that you hear them on the 5th fret. Don't worry if you don't get it at first, your hands will soon adapt.








, You can play ever single note on an E-form barre chord, which makes it very versatile up and down the neck. For harder-rocking songs, like punk, you can adapt the chord to play it faster by only strumming the top three strings (6th, 5th, 4th). This is called a ""power chord.""







, This chord sounds a little bit darker, and some say sadder, than its major cousin, but is equally easy to play. The variation changes depending on if you are playing Open or Barre chords. A Minor is usually abbreviated as ""Am.""










Open Am: This is the same shape as the one use in an A major barre chord, except you don't need to use your pointer to bar anything. Remember that the 1st string is the thin, lowest string on the bottom.

1st String -- Open.
2nd String -- Pointer finger on 1st fret.
3rd String -- Ring finger on 2nd fret.
4th String -- Middle finger on the 2nd fret.
5th String -- Open.

Am Barre Chord: Take your normal A Major Barre Chord and pick up your middle finger, leaving just the bar on the 5th fret and two fingers on the 7th fret.

3rd String -- Pinky on 7th fret.
4th String -- Bar on 5th fret.

, Seventh chords are melodic and bluesy, and are used in a variety of rock, blues, and R&B songs. They are also easily adapted from Open and Barre chords. Often written as ""A7.""










Open A7: Take your normal A Major chord, but this time you should leave the 3rd string open.

1st String -- Open.
2nd String -- Ring finger on 2st fret.
3rd String -- Open.
4th String -- Pointer finger on the 2nd fret.
5th String -- Open.
6th String -- Open.



A7 Barre Chord: Take your normal A Major Barre Chord and pick up your pinky, leaving the bar on the 5th fret, your middle finger on the 6th fret, and your ring finger on the 7th fret.

1st String -- Bar on 5th fret.
2nd String -- Ring finger on 7th fret.
3rd String -- Bar on the 5th fret.
4th String -- Middle finger on 6th fret.
5th String -- Bar on 5th fret.
6th String -- Bar on 5th fret.



, This dark, bluesy, and sparse chord is usually in brooding, slower songs. Because there is not a lot of fretting needed, it is pretty easy to play. Often written as ""Am7.""










Open Am7: This is the same structure as an A7 barre chord, just one string lower and moved up the neck.

1st String -- Open.
2nd String -- Middle finger on 2st fret.
3rd String -- Open.
4th String -- Pointer finger on the 1st fret.
5th String -- Open.
6th String -- Open.



Am7 Barre Chord: Take your normal A Major Barre Chord and pick up your pinky and middle finger, leaving just the bar on the 5th fret and your ring finger on the 7th fret.

1st String -- Bar on 5th fret.
2nd String -- Ring finger on 7th fret.
3rd String -- Bar on the 5th fret.
4th String -- Bar on the 5th fret.
5th String -- Bar on 5th fret.
6th String -- Bar on 5th fret., You don't have to bar all of the strings, however, because they are open. This means that you can play a much higher pitched version of the chord as a barre chord further down the neck. At the 12th fret, all of the open notes repeat, so the 1st string/12th fret is an E, 2nd string/12th fret is a B, 3rd string/12th fret a G, etc. Thus, by barring your pointer finger over the 12th fret and using your ring finger to bar the 14th fret you get an A Major chord that is bright and high.









You may have to sacrifice the 1st string, 12th fret E to make this work, as it is hard to bar the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th strings at once and still leave the 1st string uncovered.
All of the variations mentioned for Open A chords apply as well, as long as you add 12 frets to each diagram (open strings, or 0 fret, → 12th fret, 2nd → 14th, etc.).

Each string has a corresponding letter or note, which you need to know to learn chords. You can remember them by this short saying, frequently taught by American guitar teachers. “Eddie Ate Dynamite, Goodbye Eddie:"" The first letter of each word gives you the note, going from thickest string on top to thinnest on the bottom.









E (Thickest string)
A
D
G
B
e (Thinnest string);
, Remember -- the lowest, thinnest string is considered the first string. You're on the fifth string, second fret. This note is a B.

, This is the second fret, fourth string. This note is another E, but it is a higher octave than the open string on top.

, This is the first fret, third string. This note is a G#.

, Once you've got everything under control and fingers on the fret, simply play all six strings at once. If it sounds odd or off, gently pluck each string individually, hearing which finger might not be down on the fret or is covering an open string. The final tab for an E major chord is:









--0--
--0--
--1--
--2--
--2--
--0--

, A problem for many young guitarists is that they learn the E major chord but are sloppy transitioning to it. A good way to practice is just to leave the guitar open, then move to E. Strum it so that every single string sounds good, then take you hand off and re-set the E, working until you can land each chord smoothly.









Once you feel comfortable, pick another chord, like an A, and transition from E-A and back again to work on smooth transitions.

, You want a small, but precise area of the string under your finger. Really work on curling your fingers so the tips of your fingers are pressing down. You want to keep the long part of your hands off the other strings so that you can hear them well.

, If your finger is on the second fret, get really close to the second fret for the best sound. If you're right-handed, you want to be as close to the left edge as the fret as possible, near the head of the guitar. You don't want to be on the actually fret, just right to the headboard side of the fret.

, For you to understand their difference, you need to try this first. Lets try it with the G power chord.


Put your index finger on the 6th string (D, formerly E string) and 3rd fret.
Then put your ring finger on the 5th string (A string) and 5th fret.
and then finally, put your pinky finger on the 4th string (D string) and 5th fret.

, We will now do the G power chord from the previous step, now in for drop D tuning.


Move your index finger 2 frets higher. Your finger on the 3rd fret from the 6th string (E string) will now move to the 5th fret.
You will notice that your fingers will look like they are forming a line. Instead of using your three fingers, use only your index finger. Place your finger flatly hitting the three notes

Use your index finger to barre over an open-E7 form to make any chord a seventh.",How to Play a B7 Chord on the Guitar," Use your index finger to barre the second fret, ignoring the thick E string on top.









Don't forget that guitar strings count up from the bottom. The thing string is the 1st one, the thickest the 6th string.

Shortcut: If you know the B-major chord, you only have to remove one finger to get an B7. Remove your finger from the 3rd string and leave it open. You've now got a B7;
, If you remember how to form an open A7 chord, your fingers will be in the same shape. If not, simply use your ring finger to fret the 4th fret on the 3rd string.








, Just let the barred 2nd fret ring out instead of fretting it further down. Make sure you can here this barred string cleanly.








, This takes some beginners some practice, but is a great way to start training your fifth finger. This is the second thinnest string on the guitar. Leave the string below it, the high-e, open.









Make sure that your ring finger doesn't mute these string accidentally.

, Strum out every string by the top one to sound out your beautiful B7.

--X--, If you know an open E7, you can simply move this form down the neck to the B, barre it, and have your B7. This only works for chords starting on the sixth string, but this makes it easy to play a seventh chord anywhere. Imagine that the open strings were actually a barred fret -- they are all the same ""fret"" being sounded out in your chord. This means your other two fingers will make any chord ""barred"" a 7th. Since the B fall on the 7th fret, your B7 barre chord would look like:

Learn the open strings on the guitar.",How to Play a D Major Chord on the Guitar1," Make sure that you understand the guitar as an intersection of strings and frets. Each string is tuned to a particular note, but you can create a different by holding down the string at any given point along the fretboard. There are six strings, and in standard tuning they are tuned to E, A, D, G, B, and E.high E: the first, thinnest, and highest-pitched string. It is tuned two octaves above low E.
B: the second string, directly above high E
G: the third string, directly above B
D: the fourth string, directly above G
A: the fifth string and the second-thickest string, directly above D
low E: the sixth, thickest, and lowest-pitched string. It is tuned two octaves below the high E string.

Learn the fingering, and then practice your strumming until you can play the chord clearly. Press the strings firmly, but try not to tense up!





;
, Put your index finger on the second fret of the third (G) string. Place your middle finger on the second fret of the first (high E) string. Then, place your ring finger on the third fret of the second (B) string. Leave the top three strings open.








The index finger is forming an A note. The middle finger is making the F# note. The ring finger is creating D. Together, these three notes make up the D major chord.If you are playing a regular guitar, you will finger the chord with your left hand. You will use your right hand for strumming.

, Once your fingers are in place, use your right hand to strum downward from the D (4th) string. Only play the highest four strings: D, G, B, and high E. Do not touch the low E or the A string.Keep practicing the chord until you can generate a clear, crisp-sounding chord.

Play a barre chord from the 5th fret.,
Barre the 10th fret.,
Practice barre chords.",How to Play a D Major Chord on the Guitar3," First, use your index finger to cover every string on the 5th fret, save the low E. Then, place your middle finger on the 7th fret of the 4th (D) string; your ring finger on the 7th fret of the 3rd (G) string; and your pinkie finger on the 7th fret of the 2nd (B) string. Make sure that you are holding each string down firmly. Then, strum slowly down from the 5th string to the 1st string.









Make sure to leave the top (low E) string untouched. If you play the 6th string, here, then it won't be a D major chord., First, use your index finger to hold down every string on the 10th fret. Then, place your middle finger on the 11th fret of the 3rd (G) string. Put your ring finger on the 12th fret of the 5th (A) string, and put your pinkie finger on the 12th fret of the 4th (D) string. Strum the chord in a single sweep, from the 6th (low E) string to the 1st (high E).







, The barre chords are more technically complex than the open D major, and they require much more finger strength. Work on pressing your index finger against the fretboard. Make sure that you can hold down all of the strings firmly enough that you create a crisp, clear-sounding chord.









If the chord comes out twangy or muted, then you are not holding the strings down firmly enough. Pluck each string individually while you hold the barre chord shape. If a particular note doesn't sound clear, shift your finger around until you can play it crisply. Make sure that your fingers are as centered as possible between the frets, and that none of your fingers are accidentally muting other strings.
If you move these barre chord shapes up and down the fretboard, you can play any chord. Two frets higher, for instance, makes a C major chord. Two steps lower makes an E major chord.

Learn a few at a time.,
Practice switching between these chords.,
Get a teacher.,
Print out chord diagrams.,
Learn simple songs.",How to Memorize Guitar Chords Quickly," Rather than trying to remember all the chords in every key, learn two, or even one, to start out with. The most important chord is an A chord. Luckily, this chord is also very simple to play. After the A chord, you might want to start learning the C chord. It may look confusing at first, but it's not too different from an A chord. Both of these chords are very important when playing the guitar. Learning just a few chords will mean you'll have less to remember and if you put all of your focus into them you probably won't forget them.;
, When you memorize where your fingers go on both the A and C chords, try switching between the two. This doesn't have to be done quickly and should be practiced super slowly when you're starting out. Gradually, you'll speed up the transition between the two and learn how to play songs, you don't have to worry about that yet though. Just focus on ""feeling"" where your fingers should go and build up the muscle memory in your hands. It's hard to forget the chords when you spend ages playing them. You can also try saying the chord names out loud when you play them if it helps you.

, A personal teacher will not only teach you the correct finger positioning and technique, they will also motivate you to practice what you're learning in lesson. You may be surprised about how much you can actually play when a teacher is telling you what to do. Don't only play in lessons though, you need to practice at home too. If you're worried about the cost of a one-on-one personal teacher, consider joining in at a group session. These can sometimes be cheaper and also allow you to communicate with other musicians. Some schools offer free guitar lessons to anyone that's interested, be sure to check that out too.

, Chord diagrams show you exactly where to put your fingers and what fingers to actually use. These will help you understand what the chord shape is supposed to look like. Try to refer to these when you're stuck as opposed to Youtube videos and other Wikihow articles because they help you to visualize what the chord should look like when you play it. Stick these chord diagrams somewhere where you'll see them every day. This includes on your walls, on your wardrobe or on your actual guitar. Seeing them every day should help you to memorize them. Keep in mind that if you plan on playing your guitar out in public, chord diagrams will look very tacky on your instrument.

, Learning songs that include basic chords should help you to memorize them much quicker than just playing the chords over and over. Try to learn a song that is simple but popular so you can play them to an audience of friends and family. A good song to learn in ""Chasing Cars"" by Snow Patrol. This song is very popular and can be recognized by almost anybody. On top of that, is only has three chords (A, E and D) in it and repeats the same progression and strumming pattern throughout the whole song. This makes it easy to remember and sing along. Also, remembering what chords go in the song will also help you to remember what to chords look like and how they should sound.

The raised metal bumps on the fretboard divide it into frets. Scales are formed by playing notes on different patterns of frets, so it's important to be able to identify them. See below:


The frets are numbered from the tip of the neck towards the body of the guitar. For example, the fret at the very end of the neck is the first fret (or ""fret 1""), the next fret in is the second fret, and so on.
Holding down the string on a certain fret and strumming the string over the body of the guitar plays a note. The closer the frets get to the body, the higher the notes get.
The dots on the fret are just for reference — they make it easier to know where you're putting your fingers without having to count the frets up the neck constantly.;
, Every single fret on the guitar plays a note that has a name. Luckily, there are only 12 notes — the names just repeat over and over. The notes you can play are below. Note that some notes have two different names:



A, A#/Bb, B, C, C#/Db, D, D#/Eb, E, F, F#/ Gb, G, G#/Ab. After this, the notes start at A again and repeat.
Learning the positions of the different notes is something that's not super hard, but it takes a little too long to cover in this article. If you need help, try our article on the subject.

, You can talk about the different strings with names like ""thickest, second thickest,"" and so on, but it's a lot easier to discuss scales if you know the strings' proper names. This is also handy because the strings are named after the note that they play when you don't press any of the frets. On a normal six-string guitar in standard tuning, the strings are:E (thickest)
A
D
G
B

E (thinnest) — note that this has the same name as the thickest string, so some people will say ""low"" and ""high"" E to tell them apart. You'll also sometimes see a lowercase ""e"" used for the thinnest string.

, In simple terms, a scale is just a sequence of notes that sound nice when you play them in order. When we learn scales below, we'll see that all scales are built from patterns of ""whole steps"" and ""half steps."" This sounds complicated, but these are just ways to describe different distances on the fretboard:A half step is a distance of one fret up or down. For example, if you play a C (A string, third fret), moving one fret up will give you a C# (A string, fourth fret). We can say that C and C# are one half step apart.
A whole step is the same thing except that the distance is two frets. For example, if we start on C and move two frets up, we'll play a D (A string, fifth fret). Thus, C and D are a whole step apart.

, We're almost ready to start learning scales. The final concept to understand is that, since scales are sequences of notes that are supposed to be played in order, scale notes get special numbered names called ""degrees"" to help you identify them. The degrees are listed below.Learning the number name for each degree is most important — the other names are used less often.


The note you start on is called the root or first. It is also sometimes called the tonic.
The second note is called the second or supertonic.
The third note is called the third or mediant.
The fourth note is called the fourth or subdominant.
The fifth note is called the fifth or dominant.
The sixth note is called the sixth or submediant.
The seventh note is called the seventh — it has a couple of other names that change depending on the scale, so we'll ignore them in this article.
The eighth note is called the octave. It's also sometimes called the tonic because it's the same note as the first, only higher.
After the octave, you can either start over again from the second or keep going on from the ninth. For instance, the note after the octave can be called the ""ninth"" or the ""second,"" but it's the same note either way.

, The type of scale we'll learn in this section is the major scale. This is a good choice to learn first because many other scales are based off of the major. One nice thing about scales is that you can start them on any note at all. To begin, pick any note below the 12th fret on the low E or A string. Starting on one of the lower strings gives you plenty of room to move up and down the scale.


For example purposes, let's start on G (low E string, third fret). In this section, you'll learn how to play a G major scale — scales are named after their root note.

, All scales can be written as patterns of whole and half steps. The step pattern for a major scale is extra important to learn because many other scale patterns are derived from it. See below:


Start on the root, then follow these steps:




Whole step, whole step, half step, whole step, whole step, whole step, half step.




For example, if we're starting on G, first we'd move up one whole step to A. Then, we'd move up another whole step to B. Then, we'd move up a half step to C. Following the pattern above, we would continue up the scale, playing D, E, F#, and ending on G.

, You can play a whole scale on one string, but this is very awkward — you won't usually see guitarists do it. Instead, it's much more common to move up and down through a few different strings as you play your scale. This minimizes the amount of motion that your hand has to make.


For the G major scale we just learned, we would start on the third fret of the low E string. We would play A and B on frets five and seven of the E string.
Then, we would hit C on the third fret of the A string. We would hit D and E on frets five and seven of the A string.
Then, we would hit F# on fret four of the D string. We would end by hitting G on the fifth fret of the D string. Notice that we didn't have to move our hand up and down the neck to do this — just change strings and stretch our fingers.
All together, it should look like this:




Low E string: G (fret 3), A (fret 5), B (fret 7)

A string: C (fret 3), D (fret 5), E (fret 7)

D string: F# (fret 4), G (fret 5)





, As long as you're starting on the low E or A string, the major scale fingering pattern you just learned can be played anywhere on the neck. In other words, just shift all the notes up or down by the same number of frets/steps to play a different major scale.


For example, if we wanted to play a B major scale, we would just move up the neck to the seventh fret of the low E string. Then, we'd use the same fingering pattern as before to play the scale like this:




Low E string: B (fret 7), C# (fret 9), D# (fret 11)

A string: E (fret 7), F# (fret 9), G# (fret 11)

D string: A# (fret 8), B (fret 9)




Notice that we're putting our fingers in the same pattern of frets as before. Just move this pattern up and down to play different major scales.

, Usually, scales aren't just played in one direction. Once you master going up the major scale, try playing it back down again once you reach the octave. All you need to do is play the same notes in reverse order — no changes are necessary.


For example, if we want to play the B major scale up and down, we would play these notes:




Going up: B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#, B

Going down: B, A#, G#, F#, E, D#, C#, B




If you want to get the scale to match up with a 4/4 beat, play each note as a quarter or eighth note. Hit the octave twice or go up to the ninth (just a whole step above the octave), then go back down. This will give you the right number of notes for the scale to ""line up"" with the measures.

, A minor scale has a lot in common with a major scale. Like a major scale, it's also named for its root note (e.g., E minor, A minor, etc.) Most of the notes are even the same. There are just a few changes you need to make:The minor scale has a flat third degree.
The minor scale has a flat sixth degree.
The minor scale has a flat seventh degree.
To make a note flat, just move it down one half step. This means that the third and seventh notes in the scale will be one fret lower than in a major scale.

, Having a flat third, sixth, and seventh in a minor scale changes the step pattern from the major scale. Memorizing the new pattern can be handy as you get familiar with minors.


The step pattern for a minor scale, starting from the root, is:



Whole step, half step, whole step, whole step, half step, whole step, whole step.




For example, if we wanted to make a G minor scale, we'd start with a G major scale and move the third, sixth, and seventh degrees down a half step each. A G major scale is:



G, A, B, C, D, E, F#, G




...so a G minor scale is:



G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F G





, Just like with majors, the notes in minor scales are played with a certain pattern of frets you can slide up and down the neck to play different minors. As long as you're starting on the low E or A string, the minor pattern is the same.


For example, let's play an Eb minor scale. To do this, we'll just take an Eb minor scale and slide the third, sixth, and seventh degrees down one fret, like this:




A string: Eb (fret 6), F (fret 8), F# (fret 9)


D string: Ab (fret 6), Bb (fret 8), B (fret 9)


G string: Db (fret 6), Eb (fret 8)





, Just like with major scales, it's most common for minors to be played going up, then going down again. Again, you're just playing the same sequence of notes in reverse order with no changes.


For example, if we wanted to play an Eb minor scale up and down, we would play this:




Going up: Eb, F, F#, Ab, Bb, B, Db, Eb

Going down: Eb, Db, B, Bb, Ab, F#, F, Eb




Like with major scales, you can add the ninth (the F above the octave in this case) or play the octave twice to get the beats to line up with a 4/4 beat.

, One type of scale that's useful from a practice perspective is the chromatic scale. In this scale, all the degrees are a half step apart. This means that a chromatic scale can be made simply by going up and down the frets in order.


Try this chromatic exercise: First, pick one of the guitar's strings (it doesn't matter which). Start counting a steady 4/4 beat. Play the sting open (no notes fretted) as a quarter note, then the first fret, then the second, then the third. Without stopping, play the first fret, then the second, third, and fourth. Keep the beat steady and play the second fret, then the third, fourth, and fifth. Continue this pattern until you reach the 12th fret, then go back down!
For example, if you're playing on the high E string, your chromatic exercise would look like this:




Measure one: E (open), F (fret 1), F# (fret 2), G (fret 3)

Measure two: F (fret 1), F# (fret 2), G (fret 3), G# (fret 4)




...and so on up to the 12th fret (then back down).

, The pentatonic scale has only 5 notes and they all sound good when they're played together, so this scale is used often for soloing. Specifically, the minor pentatonic is especially popular in rock, jazz, and blues music. It's used so often that it's sometimes just called the ""pentatonic"" for short. This is the scale we'll learn below.


The minor pentatonic contains these degrees: Root, flat third, fourth, fifth, and flat seventh (plus the octave). It's basically a minor scale without the second or sixth.
For example, if we start on the low E string, the A minor pentatonic scale would be:




Low E string: A (fret 5), C (fret 8)

A string: D (fret 5), E (fret 7)

D string: G (fret 5), A (fret 7)




From here, if we want, we can keep going, playing the same notes on higher strings:




G string: C (fret 5), D (fret 7)

B string: E (fret 5), G (fret 8)

E string: A (fret 5), C (fret 8)





, Once you know the minor pentatonic scale, it's very easy to play a related scale called the ""blues scale."" All you need to do is add the flat fifth scale degree to the minor pentatonic. This will give you a scale with six notes — everything else is the same.


For example, if we wanted to turn the A minor pentatonic scale into the A blues scale, we would play:




Low E string: A (fret 5), C (fret 8)

A string: D (fret 5), Eb (fret 6), E (fret 7)

D string: G (fret 5), A (fret 7)

G string: C (fret 5), D (fret 7), Eb (fret 8)


B string: E (fret 5), G (fret 8)

E string: A (fret 5), C (fret 8)




The flat fifth is known as the ""blue note."" Even though it's in the scale, it sounds a little weird and discordant by itself, so if you're soloing, try to use it as a leading tone — that is, play it ""on the way"" to another note. Don't hang on the blue note for too long!

, Once you reach a scale's octave, you don't always have to go back down. Just treat the octave as the new root and use the same step pattern to play a second octave. We touched on this briefly with the minor pentatonic scale above, but this is something you can learn for virtually all scales. Starting on one of the bottom two strings generally makes it easier to fit two whole octaves in the same area of the neck. Note that the second octave usually has a different fingering pattern even though the steps are the same.


Let's learn a two-octave major scale — once you know this, it's easier to figure out two-octave versions of the minor scales. We'll try G major (the very first scale we learned at the top of the article). Right now, we know this:




Low E string: G (fret 3), A (fret 5), B (fret 7)

A string: C (fret 3), D (fret 5), E (fret 7)

D string: F# (fret 4), G (fret 5)




Keep going, using the same step pattern: whole step, whole step, half step, and so on...




D string: G (fret 5), A (fret 7)

G string: B (fret 4), C (fret 5), D (fret 7)

B string: E (fret 5), F# (fret 7), G (fret 8)




...and then back down!

Move your root note to make any power chord on the top two strings.",How to Make a Power Chord," A power chord is simply a two to three note chord that can be used in major or minor key songs. The placement of your index finger determines which chord you are playing. So, if you're on the sixth string, third fret, you're playing a G power chord. If you're on the fifth string and fifth fret, you're playing a D power chord, and so on.









This is called the chord's ""root note."" It dictates the rest of the chord.;
, Simply fret this not like you would fret any other note. Move your finger close to the fret for the best sound, holding it down with the tip of your finger.

, If you're right-handed, this is the note a string down and two frets to the right. If you're on the sixth string, third fret with the index finger, you want to put your index finger on the fifth string, fifth fret.

, This note, playing by barring your ring finger or using your pinky, is a thicker sounding chord. However, it is a bit slower to play and doesn't always sound good with distortion. Use the two string version for faster, harder songs and the three string version for everything else. Your final chord would look like this:

, Any string that isn't being fretted should be ignored. The exception, of course, are for power chords that start on the open E or open A string.









Focus on only strumming the top strings, angling your pick slightly out to avoid the lower strings.
IT can also help to let your index finger drape over the bottom strings, dampening them so they don't make noise when strummed.

, Once you've got this form down, all you have to do is move it to a new root note to change the chord. If you want to form a D# chord, just start on the 5th string, 6th fret, and put your ring finger on the 4th string, 8th fret. It is that easy!









Power chords are usually written as a ""Fifth chord,"" such as G5, or D#5. If you see these chords in written music, play a power chord starting at the root note, such as a G or D#.

Use bends for a unique, bluesy way to transition between notes.,
Hold down the note you want to bend with your ring finger.,
Pivot your wrist up and away from your body to bend.,
Learn how to read bends in written guitar music.",How to Bend a Note on Guitar1," Bending guitar strings are how you put personality into your notes, taking basic scales like the blues pentatonic and molding it to fit your unique musical ideas. Bends, appropriately, are a way to add ""tone color"" to your playing. They are accent notes, used for emphasis and improvisation.









All of the techniques and rules here should be, to pardon the pun, bent. Experiment with bends and strings to get the tones you want for your playing.;
, You can, of course, bend with any finger you want. However, using your ring finger will allow you to put the middle and index fingers behind the fret as well, giving you three fingers to help bend the strings instead of one.









The thicker your strings, the harder they are to bend. As such, acoustic guitars are often harder to bend, and you'll need 2-3 fingers to really manipulate the string.

, Keeping your fingers firmly in place, use your whole hand to bend the notes. The power comes from your forearm, which you should feel moving as you bend. Think of it as turning your wrist to push your index finger, and thus the string, as high as you can.








, Bends are almost always simply notated, whether you're reading tab or a guitar score. A bend, remember, makes your note higher pitched. As such, all written music tells you wen to bend, and how high to bend the note -- telling you which fret the note should sound like when bent the right amount. The following two methods of writing bends are the most common:










Tab: Usually written with a ""b"" for bend an a ""r"" for release, when the bend ends:

G|---------4b5r4------| would mean ""bend the 4th fret up so it sounds like the 5th fret, then release back to the 4th.""



Guitar scores: Will have a small upward arrow drawn on the staff, like the one in the video. It will tell you how far to bend the note, as well as when to come back down.

Half-bends only go up one fret.
Full-bends go up two frets.
Over bends push the note three frets or higher."
"
Work on ""landing"" your bends on other notes in the scale.,
Wrap your thumb over the top of the fretboard for extra power on big bends.,
Bend strings down, instead of up, when playing on the thicker strings.,
Shake your bends a bit for tasty, melodic vibrato.,
Know where you can use bends effectively.",How to Bend a Note on Guitar2," A half-step bend is a bend that moves down one fret, meaning the note you've bent so it sound's exactly like one fret down. A full-step bend moves two frets down. To really improve as a guitarist, check your tone at the top of the bend. Get used to moving right down to other notes in the scale, keeping your playing melodic and on-key.









Check your tone against a normally picked note. For example, bend the 3rd fret all the way to the 5th fret. Then pick the 5th fret normally to check if they sound the same.

, If you're bending heavy strings or just want a little extra stretch for a huge bend, you can hook your thumb over the top of the neck, allowing you to squeeze your fingers and thumbs together like a clamp. This little extra leverage can make all the difference for a big bend.








, You do not always have to push up on the strings. You get the exact same effect by pulling down -- and this is much easier with the high strings anyway. Use whatever direction feels comfortable for you in the moment, since neither is wrong or right.









When bending down, it can help to angle your fingers slightly above the string, allowing you to pull them down towards your palm.

, Vibrato is when you lightly bend the string back and forth, making the note waver or vibrate. A lot of players will shake the note in or out of the bend, or shake it slightly at the top of their bend, for a little extra flavor on the note.









If you're playing electric, try using the wammy bar for similar effects.

, Remember, it is best to bend to another note in the scale for the best effects. As such, you need to practice playing your scales with bends to find out where everything sounds best. Try playing the blues pentatonic scale first, as the simple, boxy form is perfect to practice bends. For example, look at some of the possible bends you have in a simple A-minor pentatonic scale:










Half-Step Bends:

5th string -- 5th and 6th frets.
3nd string -- 7th fret



Full Bends:

6th string -- 8th fret
5th string -- 5th fret
4th string -- 5th fret
3rd string -- 5th fret, 7th fret
2nd string -- 8th fret
1st string -- 8th fret"

Simply make up a sentence where the first letter of each word is the name of a string.If you're having a hard time coming up with your own sentence, you might want to use ""Eat All Day Get Big Easy.""
Hold your guitar in front of you so that it's facing you and look at the strings. The thickest string on the far left is low E. The A string is next to it. The third string from the left is D, followed by the G string and the B string. Finally you have the high E string to the far right, which will be the thinnest string on your instrument.
One thing to keep in mind is that as you're looking down at a guitar from a playing position, the lowest strings will be on the top of the instrument (if you're playing right-handed). However, when you're told to play the ""top"" strings, you're actually playing the thinner strings that correspond to higher notes. The ""bottom"" strings are the thicker strings that correspond to lower notes.;
, The frets are the bars that span the neck of your guitar, spaced about an inch apart. You'll be placing your fingers along the neck of the guitar at a position just above the fret indicated.








The first fret will be about an inch down from the nut or top of the guitar neck. The second fret is about an inch below that, the third fret about an inch below that, and so on.
Basic open chords typically only use the first three frets, so when you're just starting out that's all you need to be worried about.

, Even if you know how to read music, musical notation won't tell you where to place your fingers to play chords on a guitar. Fingerboard diagrams can help you learn where to place your fingers. Find them online, or download a free mobile app.The fingerboard diagram reads from left to right. If you hold up your guitar in front of you as you did to learn the strings, the line to the far left of the diagram is low E. The vertical lines on the diagram are the strings, while the horizontal lines are the frets.
There will be circles on the diagram to show where your fingers should be placed. You'll see a number in the circle that corresponds to the finger that should be placed there.
Memorize the finger numbers. Your index finger is your first finger, your middle finger is your second finger, your ring finger is your third finger, and your pinky is your fourth finger. Some more complex chords also require you to use your thumb, which is represented by a ""T"" on most fingerboard diagrams.

, The G major chord is probably one that sounds familiar, as it is the basic chord in a lot of popular songs. To finger a G major chord, put your third finger on the third fret of the low E string, your second finger on the second fret of the A string, and your fourth finger on the third fret of the high E string.








If this finger position feels uncomfortable, you can also make a G major using your first, second, and third fingers instead of your second, third, and fourth. However, keep in mind that as you progress this finger positioning may make it more difficult for you to transition quickly from G major to other chords.
When you first place your fingers, strum each string individually. For G major, you're going to strum all six strings, even the unfretted ones. This is what makes it an open chord.
With an open chord, each chord you strum should sound clearly. If a string sounds flat or muted, check your finger positioning. You should put the tip of your finger on the string to press it down, but your finger shouldn't touch any other strings.

, To make a C major chord, put your first finger on the first fret of the B string, your second finger on the second fret of the D string, and your third finger on the third fret of the B string.Notice that the finger numbers correspond to the fret numbers. That makes C major a pretty easy chord to remember.
When you strum a C major, you want to stick to the top five strings – don't strum the low E. Since you're used to strumming all six strings with G major, this might take some practice to get right.
Now that you know two chords, you might want to practice transitioning back and forth between them. This will help you memorize the chord shape and your hand positioning so that you can find the chords without needing to look at a fingerboard diagram.

, To make a D major chord, you'll place your third finger on the third fret of the B string, your second finger on the second fret of the high E string, and your first finger on the second fret of the G string.








To strum D major, you only want to strum the top four strings. In addition to the low E string that you left out when you strummed C major, you're also leaving out the A string.
You might want to practice transitioning back and forth between G major and D major, so you can get a better feel of which strings should be strummed.

, Once you're comfortable with G major, C major, and D major, you have all you need to learn some classic songs that can be played using only these three chords.








Some examples of popular songs that you can play once you know G, C, and D include Already Gone by the Eagles, Small Town and Jack and Diane by John Mellencamp, and Thunder on the Mountain by Bob Dylan.
You can find lists of songs that use those three chords online. If you can't read music, look for tablatures (or just ""tabs"") that simply give you the names of the chords played.
You'll want to start slow. Eventually, you can pull up the audio recording of the song and play your guitar along with the recording. If you can find a live video of the musicians performing, this can help you nail the strumming pattern. It may be tough to get the hang of at first, but this will help you get your strumming and chord transitions up to speed.

, If the strings are buzzing or sounding flat, it could be because your fingers are flattening out and touching the strings beside the string you're fretting. Your two finger joints should make something of a box over the neck of the guitar.The first finger joint often has the most tendency to flatten out, and can muffle or mute the string next to the one you're fretting.
To help get your fingers in the right position, think of holding an apple or a tennis ball in your hand with your fingers curled around it. This is how you want your fingers to be on the neck of the guitar – not flat.
C major and G major are good chords to use to check your finger positioning. Since your fingers are further extended, it can be easier for the knuckles to flatten out.

, If the chord isn't sounding right when you compare it to audio files, assuming your guitar is in tune, the problem may be that your fingers aren't close enough to the right fret.Generally, you want to try to keep your fingers as close to the fret as possible – but not on the fret.
In your mind, visualize the space between the frets as divided into quarters. Your finger should be in the lower quarter of this space, and no higher. For example, if you're playing a chord that requires your third finger to the on the second fret, your finger should be about three-quarters down from the first fret, just above the second fret.

, You don't have to press down too hard on the string to make the note sound. Too much pressure can cause tension and pain in your hand, not to mention injuring the skin on your fingers.








When you make a chord, you should be applying even pressure on each of the strings that you're fretting. If you're applying too much (or too little) pressure to one of the strings, it can cause the chord to sound off.

, Your wrist positioning is in many ways just as important as your finger positioning, especially if you eventually want to learn more advanced guitar chords and techniques such as bar chords or power chords. Make sure your wrist is in a neutral position.








If you tend to kink your wrist forward in front of the guitar neck, you'll probably experience pain after playing for awhile, and your fingers will have less mobility.
You also may have the tendency to kink your wrist behind the guitar neck. This may inhibit your ability to get a clean sound from your chords, as well as causing your fingers to flatten.
Keep in mind that kinking your wrist not only affects your guitar's sound and your ability to position your fingers correctly, it also can damage your wrist and lead to more serious issues such as carpal tunnel syndrome over time. If you plan to play guitar often, find some good wrist strengthening exercises and stretches to help take care of your wrists and prevent such problems.

, If you aren't sitting (or standing) with good posture, you may have problems positioning your fingers or wrist correctly. Keep your thumb on the guitar to distribute the weight, and make sure your arms and shoulders are relaxed.If you're hunched over or crunching your shoulders, you probably also have the tendency to kink your wrist.
Check your elbows as well. The elbow of your fretting arm should be close to your side, not jutting out away from you. If you have the tendency to jut your elbow out, this may be causing you to hunch over or to kind your wrist.
At least when you're first learning to play, it's typically a good idea to practice while sitting rather than trying to stand. That way you can balance the bulk of the guitar's weight on your lap rather than hanging from a strap, which can cause you to hunch if you're unaccustomed to the weight.

, To finger E major, your second finger will be on the second fret of the A string, your third finger on the second fret of the D string, and your first finger on the first fret of the G string.








From E major, if you lift your first or index finger off the string and strum, you have an E minor chord. Practice strumming these two chords together by lifting your index finger on every other strum.

, With A minor, you use exactly the same finger shape that you used to make E major, but you move your fingers over to a different set of strings. This makes A minor easy to find after you've been practicing E major.When you strum A minor, leave the low E string out and only strum the top five strings. You'll strum the same strings for A major as you do for A minor.

, For A major, your first, second, and third fingers will all be lined up along the second fret of the D, G, and B strings. This finger positioning can be difficult because there isn't much room for your second finger between your first and third.








You'll find that your first and second fingers can't really be as close to the fret as would be ideal. You'll get more comfortable with practice and be able to stretch your fingers closer to the fret.
Practicing switching from A major to E major is a good way to practice both chord shapes together. Remember that with E major you're strumming all six strings, while with A major you're only strumming the top five strings.

, While there is a more complex version of the F major chord that is a bar chord, you can learn a three-note F major chord that is much simpler. The key difficulty for you in playing the F major chord may be strumming the right strings.








To make an F major chord, put your first finger on the first fret of the B string, your second finger on the second fret of the G string, and your third finger on the third fret of the D string. You probably recognize this configuration as the same you used for C major, just on different strings.
When you strum F major, you only want to strum the three strings that you've fretted. Don't strum the low E, A, or high E strings.

, Now that you know eight chords, there are hundreds of popular and classic songs you should be able to play. Search online for tabs of songs that you enjoy. Take it slow, concentrating on one song at a time until you get to the point that you can play it without the tab.








For example, since you know G, F, and C, you can learn Sympathy for the Devil by the Rolling Stones, which uses those three chords.
There also are a wealth of popular songs that use four chords. In fact, C, A minor, F, and G make up the most popular chord progression for country, rock, and popular music. Note that if you find the F major chord difficult, you can transpose the chords and play G, E minor, C, and D instead.

Familiarize yourself with the piece as much as possible.,
Pay specific attention to the vocalist's melodic line.,
Respond to the soloist's stylistic liberties.,
Make adjustments to your chord progressions as necessary.",How to Accompany on Guitar," If you are preparing to accompany a soloist for a performance, get the sheet music as soon as possible. Get your hands used to the chord progressions by practicing them often, preferably before rehearsing with the soloist. If you are already comfortable with the piece's chord progressions, you can focus your attention on other, more subtle aspects of the song during rehearsal.


Accompaniment parts are often notated in what is called a ""lead sheet."" Lead sheets provide only minimal information about how you should play—rhythms and specific voicings are not presented. Generally only shorthand markings are given for the chords. For example, ""Em7"" denotes an E minor seventh chord, in whatever position or voicing you feel is appropriate.
Choose your chord voicings deliberately. For example, in a section of the piece that is meant to build tension, voice chords in their 1st inversion. Conversely, to establish stability you should voice chords in their root position.;
, During rehearsal (or during an impromptu performance), note both the rhythm and pitches of the soloist's melody. As an accompanist, you must be careful not to overshadow or compete with what the vocalist is doing. On the guitar, this means not attempting to match the rhythm or pitches of the melody. If you are worried about competing with the vocalist, keep your strumming simple and sparse.

, Your job as an accompanist is to let the soloist take the lead. During rehearsal, note their use of rubato (tempo fluctuations) or dynamic changes, especially ones that are not marked in the sheet music. Do your best to respond to these fluctuations by following suit—if the vocalist sings a certain passage very quietly, for example, you should play quietly as well.

, As you rehearse, you may find that some of your playing is not meshing well with the soloist's part even if you are sticking precisely to the lead sheet. In this case, it's always okay to make changes to the lead sheet. For example, if the soloist's part is getting lost beneath the rhythm guitar, you could try simplifying your chord structures. If the lead sheet calls for seventh and ninth chords, you could substitute basic major and minor triads to provide more auditory ""breathing room"" for the vocalist.

The bottom line represents the lowest, thickest string, while the top string represents the highest, thinnest string. For standard tunings, this means that the lines will represent, from the bottom up, the low E, A, D, G, B and high E strings.













E----------------------------||(Thinnest string)
B----------------------------||
G----------------------------||
D----------------------------||
A----------------------------||
E----------------------------||(Thickest string)



;
, Unlike normal musical notation, guitar tabs don't tell you which notes to play. Instead, they tell you where to put your fingers. Numbers on the lines correspond to frets on the fretboard. Each number represents a specific fret on the line it's written on. For instance, a ""1"" on the bottom line means to fret the first fret of the lowest string and play that note.









If the number is greater than 0, (1, 2, 3, 4, etc), then press your finger on that fret when you play, with ""1"" being the fret closest to the stock and fret numbers increasing as you move towards the guitar's body. If the number is 0, then pluck the open string without fretting any notes.

, When reading tabs, many times, you'll come across numbers that are aligned vertically. These are chords. Fret every note in the chord as written, then play the notes all at the same time. You'll get a fuller sound than You might see the chord name written as well. See Example 2 below.








, Tabs are read like sentences in a book - read them from left to right, across the page, dropping down to the next line only when you've reached the end of the previous. Play the notes and chords in sequence as you read them from left to right.









Note that most (but not all) tabs don't display the rhythm with which you should play the notes in the tab. They may break the tab into measures (usually signified by vertical lines in the tab between measures, but they won't tell you the rhythm of the notes within the measures. In this case, it's best to listen to the song while you read the tab to find the beat.

Some advanced tabs do count out the beat for you - this is usually done by including rhythmic markings along the top of the tab notation. Each marking is vertically aligned with a note or a rest to give a sense of how long the note or rest lasts. Typical rhythmic markings include:


w = whole note h = half note q = quarter note. e = eighth note. s = sixteenth note. Sometimes & markings are included to show that a note or rest lies on the ""and"" of a certain beat.
A dot after the rhythm marking means the corresponding note or rest is dotted. For instance, q. = dotted quarter note.
For rhythm basics, see How to Read Music




, Many songs have guitar parts made up solely (or mostly) of chords. This is especially true for rhythm guitar parts. In this case, the tab may forgo typical tab notation in favor of a simplified list of chord changes. These chords are almost always written in standard chord notation (Amin = A minor, E7 = E dominant 7, etc.) Simply play the chords in the order that they're listed - if it's not noted otherwise, try playing one chord per measure, but if the changes don't sound right, listen to the song for the strumming pattern.









Sometimes, these chord changes are printed above the lyrics of the song to give you a sense of when these chords are played, as in this snippet from a tab for The Beatles' ""Twist and Shout:""
(A7)...................(D)...............(G)............(A)
Well shake it up baby, now (shake it up baby)

, As you can see in the example above, many tabs aren't just collections of lines and notes. Tabs use a wide variety of special symbols to tell you how to play the notes in the tab. Most symbols refer to specific playing techniques - to make a song sound as much like the recording as possible, pay attention to these special markings.
, In a tab, an ""h"" inserted between two notes (e.g. 7h9) means to perform a hammer on. To hammer on, play the first note normally, then use a finger on your fretting hand to tap down on the second note without using your strumming hand to pluck the note.

Sometimes ""^"" is used instead (e.g. 7^9).

, - A ""p"" inserted between two notes (e.g. 9p7) means to perform a pull off, which is essentially the opposite of a hammer on. Pluck the first note while using another finger to fret the second note. Then, quickly lift the finger fretting the first note. The second note will sound.

As with hammer ons, sometimes ""^"" is used instead (e.g. 9^7). In this case, know to perform a pull off if the second note is lower and a hammer on if the second note is higher.

, If a ""b"" is inserted between two fret numbers (e.g. 7b9), fret the first note and bend it up until it sounds like the second.

Sometimes the second number is in parentheses, and occasionally the ""b"" is omitted altogether. If there is an ""r"" it denotes what the note should be released to (e.g. 7b9r7).

, Perform a basic slide by striking a note, moving your finger up or down a string without releasing it from the fretboard, then striking another note. An ascending slide is marked by a forward slash ""/"" and a descending slide is marked by a backwards slash ""\"" (e.g. 7/9\7).

A lowercase ""s"" usually means to perform a legato slide. This is like a normal slide, but you only strike the first note with your pick. Let your target note sound simply from the motion in your fret hand.





There is debate among guitarists over whether a light pick strike is appropriate for the target note. The most important thing is to remember to leave no gap between notes.


Shift slides are signified by an uppercase ""S."" In this case, strike the target note without striking the initial note of the slide.






, If your guitar has a tremolo bar, (also known as a ""whammy bar"" or ""vibrato bar"") follow these symbols to achieve some remarkably out-there effects.

If you see a ""\n/,"" where n = some number, perform a tremolo bar dip. Quickly hit and release the bar to dip the note's pitch. The number between the slashes gives an indication of the pitch you should dip to - dip the pitch by ""n"" semitones (a semitone is the same as the pitch between two adjacent frets.)For instance, ""\5/"" means to drop the pitch by 5 semitones, which will be the same tone as 5 frets below the original note.





If you see a ""\n,"" where n = some number, fret note ""n,"" then strike it and depress the tremolo bar deeply to dramatically drop the pitch.
If you see ""n/,"" raise the tremolo bar up after striking note ""n"" to raise the pitch. On some guitars, you can also put your bar in ""inverted"" position first so that hitting the bar raises the pitch rather than lowers it.
If you see ""/n\,"" perform a tremolo bar inverted dip by first depressing the tremolo bar, then raising it. As above, this also works in inverted position.






, Look for ""~"" or ""v"". If you see these symbols, perform vibrato on the preceding note. Strike the note, then use your fretting hand to rapidly bend and unbend the string, vibrating the pitch of the note.
, Several tab symbols indicate different methods for giving notes a ""muted"" sound.

If you see an ""x"" or a dot below the number, mute the string. Lay your fretting hand finger(s) across the designated strings so that when you strike them they produce a dull, clicking sound. Several ""x"" in a row, on adjacent strings, indicates a rake - just mute more than one string at once.





If you see ""PM,"" play using palm muting. For standard right-handed guitar playing, gently lay the edge of your right palm across the strings near the guitar's bridge. When you strike the notes (with the same hand as is providing the mute), you should hear the tone of the note, but with a subdued, dead quality. Move your hand slightly up the strings toward the neck to deaden the notes more.






, Tapping is usually represented by a ""t."" If you see a ""t"" in a string of notes, (e.g. 2h5t12p5p2) use one of the fingers on your picking hand (usually your right hand) to tap down hard on the indicated fret. This is a useful technique for making very rapid, fast changes in pitch.
, Guitar tabs differentiate between several different techniques for playing harmonics - bell-like tones created by special fretting techniques.

For natural harmonics, the fret is surrounded by ""< >"" (e.g. <7>). If you see this, lay a fretting finger across the metal line at the right of the fret, not the middle of the fret. Then, strike the string for a clear bell tone.





Pinch harmonics are signified by surrounding the fret number in brackets (e.g. ). To perform a pinch harmonic, strike the note with your pick hand while your pick hand thumb is also touching the note. Use vibrato from your fret hand to add sustain to the tone.Pinch harmonics are difficult. It requires lots of practice.





Note: these are best performed on an electric guitar with distortion using a bridge pickup.


Tapped harmonics are signified by two notes, the second enclosed in parentheses (e.g. n(n)). Tapped harmonics are like natural harmonics, but shifted around the neck. Fret the first note, then use a finger on your pick hand to slap or strike the string at the second fret position.






, When you see a ""tr"" written in or above the tab, it's usually between (or above) two notes. Often, it's accompanied by a string of tildes (""~'s."") This simply means to strike the first note, then rapidly hammer on to the second note and pull off to the first note again and again.
, ""TP"" means you should tremolo pick the note - essentially, pick the single note over and over as rapidly as you can. Sometimes, a TP symbol is followed by a string of tildes or dashes to give you a sense of how long to tremolo pick.
, Notice that it shows several three-note chords as well as some individual notes descending on the higher strings. In the following steps, we'll walk through this tab beat-by-beat.





E---------------3-0--------------------||

D-2-7-7-7-7-7-7------------------------||
A-2-5-5-5-7-7-7------------------------||

E-0-------5-5-5------------------------||






, In this case, first you would play a power chord in E (Middle finger/Finger 2 on the second fret on the A string, ring finger/Finger 3 on the second fret on the D string, and no finger on the low E string) strumming those first 3 strings (E,A,D) once. Play the chord highlighted with parentheses below:




E-------------3-0-----------------||

G-----777-----------2-0-----------||
D-(2)-777--777--------------------||
A-(2)-555--777--------------------||
E-(0)------555--------------------||





, The next chord you would play would be a power chord on the fifth fret of A three times. So you would play with your index finger on the fifth fret of A, your middle finger on the seventh fret of D, and your ring finger on the seventh fret of G. Then, simply shift this finger shape down one string so that your index finger is on the fifth fret of the E string with your other fingers on the seventh frets of the A and D strings. Play the chords in the sequence that they're highlighted with parentheses below:

, After the first 3 chords in the example, proceed to the right and play the single notes. Put any finger on the third fret of the high E string, pluck once, then play the open high E string, and so on through the six descending notes. Play the notes below in the order they're highlighted in parentheses:

, Play the chords and notes from left to right without stopping. Tap your foot, playing each note or chord on each tap of your foot. Work slowly and carefully, only increasing your speed once you've mastered playing the tab slowly."
"
Recognize the musical staff.,
Memorize the notes of each line in the staff using the acronym ""Every Good Boy Does Fine."",
Memorize the spaces between the lines using the acronym ""FACE."",
Use lines above and below the basic staff, known as ledger lines, to get higher and lower notes.,
Read the key signatures, made of sharp, flat, and natural signs, to know what key the song is in.,
Use time signatures to determine the rhythm of the song.,
Use the vertical bars in the staff to find the end of each measure.,
Recognize the different types of notes.",How to Read Guitar Music1," You know you have written music when you see five lines, capped off on the ends. On the far left will be a ""clef"" (a italicized ""G"" or ""C"" shape), a set of numbers, like 44{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{4}}}, and a set of hashes or flats denoting the key. Together, these elements make up a musical staff.





Guitar is also written as ""tablature,"" a unique music-writing system for guitar. Tabs resembles traditional musical staffs but have six lines instead of five, no clef, and often say ""Tab"" on the far left side.

Guitar music is always written in ""treble clef."" This means the symbol on the far left is always a cursive G, with the bottom looping around the second-lowest line of the staff.;
, Each line in the staff signifies a note, like an A, an E, etc. When there is a note symbol on the line, you play that note -- but you have to know which line is which note. Starting from the bottom, the notes are E - G - B - D - F, or the acronym ""Every Good Boy Does Fine""




, The spaces in between the lines also denote notes, meaning that the staff, in total, covers nine different notes (not counting sharps and flats, which will be covered later). From the bottom up, the spaces signify the notes F - A - C - E, or ""FACE."" Including the spaces, the final staff from looks like:





F

E

D

C

B

A

G

F

E


, If you see small little lines above and below the staff, these are simply to extend the range of the sheet music beyond the five lines on the staff.





Each line has a note above and below, and you need to memorize it as you move forward. For now, however, just work on the basics.


, The key signature is between the staff and the time signature. It will be made up of some combination of three signals -- ♯, ♭, ♮ -- lined up on the staff. You'll need to memorize key signatures to know them -- the one in the video above is the key of D. However, they still give useful information if you don't know the key:





Depending on what line the symbol fall on, you adjust that note. In the example above, there is a sharp on the F line, and one on the C space. This means any note on these lines you 'must make a sharp. This automatically keeps you in key.


, Time signatures tell you how many beats per measure in the song. The most common is 44{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{4}}}, which means that each measure consists of ""four quarter-note beats."" This is just a complicated way to say you count out ""1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1... etc."" to keep time with the song. Other time signatures, like {\displaystyle }, changes the number of beats in the measure -- in this case ""three quarter-note beats,"" as in ""1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1....""




, There are often numbers above each line, telling you which measure you're on to help coordinate with a band.




, The placement of a note on the line or space tells you what note to play -- they type of note tells you how long to play it. A whole note is played for the whole measure, a half note for half a measure, and so on down to thirty-second notes. For now, just get used to the different types of notes you're likely to encounter:






Whole notes: O


Half notes: A whole note with a vertical tail, a quarter note with a hollow center.


Quarter notes: ♩


Rests: are times to not play -- they are either thick ""--"" marks for whole and half rests and squiggles for quarter note rests.

Place your middle finger on the 5th string, second fret.,
Place your ring finger on the 4th string, second fret.,
Leave the other strings open.,
Strum all the strings at once.,
Alternatively, remove your index finger from an E major chord to get to the Em instantly.",How to Play the Em Chord on the Guitar," Remember, the 5th string is the the second highest string from the top, or the A string. Place your middle finger just to the left of the second fret (for right-handed guitarists), as near to the fret as possible so that you get a clean, clear tone.






;
, Your ring finger simply goes right underneath your middle, holding the second fret on the D string. This is the third string from the top. Again, keep your finger near that second fret, but still on the head-side of the guitar.









The head of the guitar is the small piece at the end of the neck with the tuning knobs.

, All an E-minor chord requires are those two strings and two frets. Make sure you use the tips of your fingers on the frets so that you don't accidentally mute the lower strings -- you want them free to ring out.








, The Em chord uses every string on the guitar, so you can strum away freely. However, for a deeper, darker sound, limit yourself to just the top four strings or so. For a lighter sound, like in many ska and reggae songs, just play the bottom 3-4 strings.








, If you already know how to play an E-major chord, you can get to the Em by simply lifting your index finger off the first fret. Your final chord will look like:









--0--
--0--
--0--
--2--

Hold notes for lines curving underneath two or more notes.,
Let lines arcing over notes tell you when to hammer on and pull off.,
Repeat any sections book ended by the bold, vertical ""repeat"" sign.,
Use the string indicators to know which specific note you're supposed to play.,
Use finger indicators next to the note to help with positioning.,
Research more complicated notes and notation as you grow as a musician.",How to Read Guitar Music2," If there is a concave line between two notes (it bends downward), then you want to hold the notes




, This is known as ""legato,"" where every note is slightly blended together. Use hammer-ons and pull-offs to glide between these notes as seamlessly as possible.




, These come at the end of a measure. The normal vertical bar is bolded, with a colon (:) right before it. This means you go back to the last time you saw this symbol and repeat the playing until you get back again.




, Do you play the A on the fifth string or the second? Guitar tab will have a helpful number circled above the note telling you which string to play on.




, If there is a small number next to the note, it is telling you to use a specific finger. Your first finger is your index finger, your fourth is your pinky.




, There a lot more notes out there that, while less common in guitar music, are worth knowing. The first thing that you should explore are different notes -- from sixteenth notes down the eighth note rests.

Learn the open strings, or the notes for each string if you aren't holding down a fret.,
Know that notes count alphabetically from A to G. In western music, notes are written as the letters A - G. After G, the notes cycle back to A, but a higher-pitched version of A.,
Identify the sharp and flat notes in between the letters.,
Move down one fret to raise the note up a half-step.,
Find all of the natural notes on the first string.,
Think of the guitar as having only 12 frets.",How to Learn All the Notes on the Guitar1," The guitar is made up of six strings, with the thickest, heaviest string on top and the thinnest on the bottom. Guitar strings count from the bottom up -- so the thin string is the 1st and the thick string is the 6th. From the bottom up, the notes are E B G D A E. There are a variety of ways to remember the strings, but one of the simplest is:



Every

Boy

Gets

Dessert

At

Easter;
, As you move down the fret board (towards the body of the guitar), you cycle down the notes. An E, therefore is higher up the fret board than a F, and a G, and then the next A.


The note before is considered lower. So a B is lower than the next C.
A note that occurs later on is a higher note. An E is a higher note than the earlier D.

, In between the notes are sharps (represented by a #) and flats (represented by a ♭). Sharps are the notes right after a letter, like an A→ A#, and flats are right before a note, like a D♭→ E. Sharps and flats are interchangeable, depending on the song. For example, the note between a C and D is written as either a C# or a D♭. The full set of notes is:


A, A#, B, C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#
Notice that there is no such thing as E# or B#. E and B do not ever have sharps, and the notes simply skip from E→F. As such, there is no C♭ or F♭ either. If you remember this small exception to the rule, memorizing the guitar will be easy.

, The frets of a guitar are numbered, with 0 being an open string, 1 being the fret closest to the head, and so on. A half-step is simply moving from one note to the next (A→ A#), including the sharps and flats, whereas a full-step jumps two notes (A→ B, B→ C#). Each fret represents a half step up from the one before it. So:


On the top string, the first note (an open string) is E.

The first fret on the top string is an F (remember, there is no such thing as E#).
The second fret on the top string is an F#.

The third fret on the top string is a G.

This continues all the way down. Try naming each note on one string. If you got it all right, you'll be back to E by the 12th fret.

, Natural notes are those without sharps or flats (A,B,C,D,E,F,G). The best place to begin learning is on the top (or 6th) string, the E. On this string, the first few major notes are marked by dots on the fretboard.E is on the open string.
F is on the 1st fret.
G is on the 3d fret.
A is on the 5th fret.
B is on the 7th fret.
C is on the 8th fret.
D is on the 10th fret.
E is on the 12th fret, and the pattern repeats.

, Frets are the small metal bars on the neck. When you press a string down on a fret, it gives you a different note, moving down the scale. But at the 12th fret (usually noted by 2 dots on the guitar), the whole guitar resets. The 12th fret of any string is the identical note as the open string, and then everything repeats. This means you only need to learn the notes from 0-12 frets, then know that they are identical after the 12th fret.On the twelfth fret, for example, your notes would be E B G D A E, from the bottom up.
This is because there are only 12 notes total in Western music -- A, A#, B, C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#. After the 12th note you are back where you started.

Learn the song.",How to Play Chasing Cars on Guitar4," In Chasing Cars, this chord progression is used the whole way through. It uses the ""A"" chord for two bars, the ""E"" chord for two bars and then the ""D"" chord for two bars. As long as you can keep this pattern up, you can play the song.

, This song is extremely simple and doesn't require any vigorous strumming or skill. After learning all of the chords, you need to learn the actual song. Chasing Cars only has two parts, a verse and a chorus. Listen to the song to see how they both work.


The verse. Keeping the A, E, D chord progression, pick the third string and then the first string over and over. You should hear the riff that is played throughout the song. This riff is also played during the first chorus.
The chorus. Instead of picking the notes like you do in the riff, just strum the A chord, then the E chord and then the D chord. Down strum on every beat, don't miss any out. Remember that the song is counted like this: ""1&2&3&4&"" and strum on all of the beats. Try to make the upbeats' strum louder than the downbeats' strum to add dynamics.

Learn each note individually, instead of trying to learn the whole guitar at once.,
Use octaves to find the same note on a lower string.,
Know that identical notes are only 1 string and 5 frets away.,
Find the patterns on the fretboard.,
Spend 5-10 minutes finding each note every time your practice.,
Learn to read music to test your knowledge.",How to Learn All the Notes on the Guitar2," Get the first string memorized, then focus on one letter completely. Start by finding all of the Es between the head and the 12th fret and then move on to another letter. Trying to learn all the notes at once is much too confusing to be productive, so split the task up into individual notes. There are a lot of theories out there about what order to learn notes, but a good order to try is E - G - B - F - D - A - C.


Practice playing just that one note, using the same finger each time. Build up speed slowly until you can find every single note without looking.
You can use the top string to locate just about every note. Once you know the notes on the low E-string you can use the following tricks to find them anywhere.

, Octaves are the same note, but at different pitches. Think of perfectly harmonizing singers, one who is high-pitched, one low and deep, who are singing the same note, to understand octaves. On guitars, octaves make it easy to find notes. Simply move down two strings, and then right 2 frets, and you have an octave. For example, start with your finger on the 6th string, 3rd fret. This is a G. If you move down to the 4th string, 5th fret, this is also a G.









There is one exception to this. The 2nd string (open B) is a half-step deeper than the rest. So, to find an octave ending on the 2nd string, you go down two strings, and right three frets.


, If you go down one string, then to the left 5 frets, you arrive at an identical note to the one you started on. For example, if you start on the 4th string, 10th fret, you can find an identical note on the 3rd string, 5th fret (these are both C).









You can also go in reverse. A string higher and to the right 5 frets will also create an identical note.
Like with octaves, the 2nd fret is the only exception. If you end on the 2nd string, you move the left 4 frets, not 5. So, the match for 3rd string, 4th fret note is an open B-string, or the 0-fret., There is a variety of tricks and patterns that can help you find notes at any time with a bit of quick thinking. Using the octaves and matching notes, you can add the following tricks to help you locate any note as you practice:


The top and the bottom string, both E, are identical.
The D string, the 4th string, is just the E string shifted 2 frets down.
The G string, the 3rd string, is just the A string shifted 2 frets down.
The B string, the 2nd string, is just the A string shifted 2 frets up., For example, for the first week, you might spend the first 5 minutes of practice finding every single E on the guitar. For the whole week, find and play every E note on the fretboard, practicing to the point where you don't need to count or find it. The next week, move on to find every single F. After a few weeks you'll have the board happily memorized.


Pick a spot on the guitar and move only up and down on all 6 strings, hitting just the Es in your little box to where you started. Slowly build up speed as you play until you know all the Es on that section of the fretboard.
Don't worry too much about the sharps and flats -- once you know the natural notes these will be easy to find., Music notation is written out in notes, so being able to quickly read music and find the matching frets on the guitar is the perfect way to learn the notes quickly and effectively. If you can get to the point of basic ""sight reading,"" where you can look at sheet music and find the notes as you read, you've perfectly memorized the notes.

Position your index finger along a fret.,
Press your thumb against the back of the neck.,
Practice the major chord.,
Play barre chords like Jimi Hendrix.",How to Play Barre Chords on a Guitar1," You don't want to use the squishiest part of your finger, but rather use the harder portion close to your thumb.As you begin practicing barre chords, place your middle finger on top of your index finger, but only to familiarize yourself with the required pressure needed against the strings./images/thumb/1/15/Play-Barre-Chords-on-a-Guitar-Step-1-Version-4.jpg/v4-550px-Play-Barre-Chords-on-a-Guitar-Step-1-Version-4.jpg

The eighth fret is lower in string tension. This will make an easier starting point for your fingers.;
, Imagine holding your fingers on the neck of a guitar like you're squishing a bug. Apply pressure from both sides to get the cleanest sound. It will feel awkward at first.

Barre the eight fret with your index finger.
Place your ring finger on the fifth string (A) on the tenth fret.
Place your pinky-finger on the fourth string (D) on the tenth fret as well.
Then place your middle finger on the third string (G) on the ninth fret.
This will be hard at first, but know that everyone has struggled just like you are.

, Jimi played the guitar differently than the described method above. He employed the thumb over technique.What this means is that instead of barring your index finger, you can use your thumb on the lowest string. Imagine holding the guitar neck like a microphone or a drum stick. Everyone has their preferences and many people would advise against this approach, but you could say, ""this is how Hendrix played.""

If you are going to recreate a specific outfit, follow the tips in this section, or take a look at one of the other methods.


Have lots of reference pictures printed out or saved online.
Try a theme. A lot of Katy Perry's looks include cats or candy.;
, Katy Perry is known for her bright, colorful, and unique patterns.Most of her looks feature a 19050s, style dress with a full-circle skirt, but she also has worn A-line dresses and tube dresses as well.


You can always modify the dress by gluing wrapped candy to it, such as: Lollipops, Tootsie Rolls, and Smarties.Use stencils and fabric paint to add a large cookie, cotton candy, or peppermint candy print., The higher the heels are, the better, preferably at least 4 inches (10.16 centimeters). If you aren't comfortable wearing heels that tall, you can try regular heels or even Mary Janes, but keep them bright and colorful. Here are some colors and styles to look for:


Clear shoes, preferably green.Pink, glittery Mary Janes.Bright, solid colors.

, Katy Perry had her hair in almost every color imaginable. Her most memorable hair colors were blue, purple, and pink. Most of her hair styles were simple, shoulder-length cuts with straight bands that end just above her eyebrows. She also wore lots of vintage styles inspired by the 1940s and 1950s. Here are some suggestions:


Wavy, dark purple, shoulder-length wig with a side part and no bangs.Shoulder-length lilac wig with the bangs rolled in a 1940s or 1950s fashion.Wavy-curly blue wig that falls past your shoulders with straight, full bangs.Green wig, shoulder length, with blunt bangs.

, Katy Perry's looks are bright and colorful, and no two outfits are alike. She seems to have a certain go-to look for her makeup, however, that focuses on shimmer, bold eyeliner, and thick, heavy falsies. Here's how to get the basic look:Cover your lid with neutral eyeshadow (preferably beige).

Microphone (handheld or head)
Thick, colorful bangle bracelets
A headband with hearts on it. Nab it during Valentine's day!Pink tights or thigh-high stockings., Trace two small, Styrofoam rings onto a yellow-tinted sponge, then cut the circles out.

Stuff the ""frosting"" into a piping bag fitted with a large, open-star tip. Pipe it onto the cupcake base., Top each cupcake off with a red pompom. Add some sprinkles or colorful seed beads. Glue a strip of light blue felt or crepe paper around the Styrofoam base to hide it., Coat the inside of each cupcake with tacky glue, fabric glue, or any other strong glue. Press the cupcakes onto the cup part of each bra, then let the glue set.Finish off the look by gluing a small, pink bow between the two bra cups, if desired.


You can also use a bikini top instead.

, They should be fitted and slightly high-waisted. If you can't find a pair of glittered or sequined shorts, you can instead wear regular blue shorts or blue jean shorts.

, If you can't find any, get a pair of regular pumps, then coat them with decoupage glue (ie: Mod Podge) and pink glitter. Let the glue dry, then apply another layer or two until you have an even coverage.


The higher the heels, the better. If you aren't comfortable with this, you can wear regular heels or even flats—as long as they are pink and glittery!

, You will need a white, knee-length dress to use as your base. You can use an old dress as a base, or buy one from a thrift store or on sale. Here is how you can make her dress:Cut 8 to 11 large circles out of white construction paper. Vary the sizes a bit.
Paint the circles with red paint to look like peppermints.
Coat the red areas with glue, then add red glitter on top..
Secure the peppermints to the dress with glue, Velcro, safety pins, or double-sided tape.

, The styles that work the best for this are character dance shoes or Mary Janes. The heel should be between 2 and 3 inches (5.08 and 7.62 centimeters) tall. If you can't find red, glittery heels, you can make your own by coating them with glossy decoupage glue (ie: Mod Podge), then adding red glitter.


You will need several layers of decoupage glue and glitter. Let each layer dry before doing the next.
Seal your shoes afterwards with a final coat of decoupage glue.

, Look for a wig that falls past your shoulders. It can be straight or wavy, but it should have straight, blunt-cut bangs., Keep your eyeshadow simple, with silver or grey in the creases.

You can also add a thick, white bangle with red candy stripes on it.Katy Perry also wore nude, shimmery tights with rhinestones on them.

, Pull apart pink, blue, and yellow plastic Easter eggs. Discard the top halves and glue the bottom halves to the dress with super glue, hot glue, or fabric glue. Do 2 rows of pink, then 2 rows of blue, then 2 rows of yellow. Repeat the pattern, if needed. Be sure to leave some space between each ""dot"" so that the white dress is showing, just like the candy.If you can't get plastic Easter eggs, you can cut Styrofoam balls in half, then paint them hot pink, bright blue, and yellow instead. Don't use super glue on these.
You can also use clear, plastic DIY ornaments instead—the kind that you pull apart into two halves. Paint them on the inside rather than the outside.
If the dress is stretchy, have somebody glue the dots onto the dress while you are wearing it.

, Get some white, pumps with high heels, at least 4 inches (10.16 centimeters). Decorate them with candy dots (keep them in two rows of pink, 2 rows of blue, then 2 rows of yellow). You can also use puffy paint, regular paint, or buttons.


Don't like wearing high heels? Wear a different pair of choose, but keep the same theme: white with pink, blue, and yellow dots.

, The wig needs to fall past your shoulders, close to your elbows. It can be wavy or straight, but it would be better if it is straight at top and curly on the bottom. The bangs should be cut straight across.

, Use a silvery-grey eyeshadow, and thick, heavy eyeliner. Add a cat-eye or wingtip to your eyeliner, then put on a pair of thick, heavy falsies. Finish off the look with a touch of pink blue and bright pink lipstick.

, Katy Perry did not wear many accessories for this costume. She wore two bracelets made from large, chunky white or pastel-colored beads. You can try to find or make similar bracelets, or skip them entirely; the outfit is memorable as it is.

Adjust the power of your hammer on so that the picked and hammered note of the same volume.,
Incorporate hammer-ons anywhere across the neck to increase your playing speed.",How to Hammer on a Guitar Note," Start by just practicing this motion. With your hand around the guitar, quickly land a finger on the fret, as if you were about to play it. Practice making the note really sound out when you hit it. Get used to making the guitar sound out like this by ""playing"" several notes without ever picking.






;
, Simply play one note on the guitar, using your index finger so that the rest of your hand is open. It is much easier to hammer on to a note if it is nearby a note you're already holding down. Pick this note, letting it ring out.








, Simply place the finger firmly down on another fret, staying on the same string as the note you picked. This note should sound out, but because you only picked the string once it will seamlessly transition from the first note you played.









Try to land your hammer on as close to the back of the fret (the side away from your strumming hand) to get the best sound.

, If you over-hit the note it will go sharp, sounding out with a weirdly higher pitch. Too soft and you can't hear it at all. The perfect middle ground is found by aiming for the same volume as a normally picked note.









You can use any finger to hammer on. However, it is usually easiest to learn with the ring and index fingers.

, Hammer-ons can come after notes, can ""roll"" down two or three notes at once (rapidly hammering on three frets with three fingers), and can be combined with pull-offs for dazzling speed.









A pull-off is simply the reverse of a hammer on. While on two different frets on the same string, you slightly pluck as you remove your ring finger, sounding out the next fret you're holding or an open string."
