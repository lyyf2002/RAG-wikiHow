Explore Katy’s makeup line.,
Strengthen your brows.,
Plump up your lashes.,
Add a pop of color to the lips.",How to Look Like Katy Perry2," Katy recently came out with her InstaGlam Makeup Collection by Covergirl.With several shades of foundation, concealer, lip color, and nail polish, there is bound to be something that suits your skin. Especially when choosing a foundation, pick a shade that makes your skin light and young, just like Katy’s makeup., Katy’s famous eyebrows are strong and full. Whether or not that look is for you, your brows still need to be on point. Using tweezers, gently remove any stray hairs. When you’re content with the shape, use an eyebrow pencil (for beginners) to gently stroke outwards into the shape of your brows.Use short strokes to keep a natural look. This will keep them looking full and soft yet defined.


If you are a novice or expert, try using an angled brush with a powder instead of an eyebrow pencil. This gives you more control and allows you to better shape your brows.If you’re having trouble seeing your brow shape, try gently brushing your eyebrows directly upwards. This will help bring out their natural shape and allow you to fill them in easier., It’s no secret that Katy has thick and wild eyelashes. To help define your lashes, apply your mascara in small back-and-forth motions across the eye, while spinning the brush up and out.This helps coat your eyelashes evenly. Continue this all the way to the tips of your lashes for added length.


If your lashes are particularly thin, angle the mascara brush upwards and apply your mascara. This helps apply a larger coat of mascara while keeping your lashes from clumping.Still not enough? Dust baby powder with a brush onto your lashes and then apply mascara. The microscopic flakes of powder will add dimension and thickness to your natural lashes., Katy often wears toned down eye makeup and big eyelashes finished with a bold lip. Experiment with greens, blues, reds, purples, and yellows. If you feel unsure about such bold colors, initially try a soft pink or coral lip. Remember, there are no rules to lip color.Another option is to try a colored gloss or stain instead of a lip stick.Gloss will often be less bold while a stain is great for lasting throughout the entire day.


To maximize lip color, blend concealer onto your lips before applying lipstick. This gives your lipstick boldness and prevents it from bleeding off of your lips.Another option for staying-power and boldness is dust a layer of translucent powder atop your lips in between application. This keeps the lipstick from sliding around and retains the color."

Keep yourself open to new textures.,
Wear wild shoes.,
Think retro.,
Add some glasses.",How to Look Like Katy Perry3," Katy is always pairing different textures and fabrics together. Emulate her style by incorporating sparkly leggings and a leather dress with patent shoes.The varied textures allows your outfit to become multi-dimensional.


Add texture by wearing nylons with your shorts or skirt instead of leggings. Nylons are an inexpensive way to add variety to your outfits.

, If you’re a heel person, stick to platforms. Katy loves platform shoes and they not only make a bold statement but are often more comfortable than regular footwear..If you feel heels are too old for you or just aren’t your style, watch for flats in bright colors or wacky accents such as pictures or feathers. Don’t limit yourself to ballet flats. Watch for sandals, slip ons, or slippers., Katy Perry is often seen in a pin-up, retro style.Visit your local second hand stores and look for lace, A-line waists and puffy skirts. If it looks glam or over the top, it works.


Are you less girly? Don’t worry. Retro doesn’t have to mean lace and fluff. Think about high waisted pants or jeans if you’re style favors low maintenance. Another option is khaki green, military-style pants paired with a bold lip., Katy is often seen in either retro or geeky frames. Depending on your daily outfit, try adding some glasses to finish off your look. If you’re going retro, look for white or bold colored glasses in a cat eye shape.When wearing a nerdy look, pick some square and plastic frames in a black or brown color."

Select one of numerous shield materials.,
Paint the shield.,
Place a white star in the center of the shield.",How to Make a Captain America Costume," This shirt will form the base of your costume. It does not need to be fancy. If anything, simpler is better. It should neither be taut nor baggy. Comfortably snug is best.;
,


Use a bright blue spray paint approved for use with fabrics. Do not use baby blues or near-black dark blues. You may want to do one layer, let dry, and assess the color. If it's not rich enough, spray on another coat.

If you have a limited budget (of money or time), it might be easier for you to create the top blue portion of the costume with a blue t-shirt. The shirt should be loose enough to wear over the white shirt but not so loose that it can be seen flapping or blowing around in the breeze. Cut the bottom of the shirt off, starting at the mid-chest area, and hem it up with a needle and thread or by tacking it together with fabric glue or fabric tape. (Captain America's abs are red and white -- that's why you'll only need half a t-shirt.)



, Measure the distance between the cut bottom of your blue shirt or the bottom of your football chest pad to the bottom of your white shirt. Cut out several strips of red felt or red duct tape -- each strip should be about 2 inches (5 cm) wide.


Depending on the illustration, Captain America has somewhere between 3 and 5 red stripes vertically placed on his waistline. Use the size of your stomach to determine how many stripes you need and how wide they should be.

, The bottom of each stripe should start at the bottom hem of your white shirt and should extend up to the bottom of the blue shirt or blue painted chest pad. Space the stripes about 2 inches (5 cm) apart (depending on your size).


If you're using tape, no further adhesive is required. If you're using felt, use fabric craft glue or sew the strips on with needle and thread.

, The white star can be made of any felt or fabric and should be about 6 inches (15 cm) tall and wide.


The star could also be made out of thin white cardboard or silver metallic poster-board. Alternatively, you might be able to find an iron-on star patch if you do not want to create one.
Adhere the star to the front of the blue top. It should be centered on your sternum, not overlapping onto the white t-shirt portion. Glue, sew, or iron-on the star to the blue shirt or blue chest pad.

, The blues need to match or be very close to matching; if not, the costume will look disjointed. You could use blue football pants, but if you cannot find these, use sweatpants (tight sweatpants) or leggings.


If you can't find a pair that match, look into dyes. They're widely available at fabric or craft supply stores and aren't very expensive.

And if you can pull off spandex, by all means.



, A plain brown or black leather belt will work, or you could find a combat-style belt with various pouches hanging off of it. Either way, a belt is necessary to complete the outfit and to cover up the elastic band of your pants.


Captain America only sometimes wears the pouches on his belt. That being said, it will cover up where the two pieces of your outfit meet -- typically the hardest area to make look professional.

, While the old Captain America from the comic books had a face mask, the newer version of the costume uses an actual helmet. A simple army-style helmet will work best, but if you want to get picky, look for one that is specifically in the style of a 1940s M-1 fixed bale helmet. Spray paint the helmet the same shade of blue as your chest pad or t-shirt.


If it's near Halloween, you're in luck. If it's not, find an army supply store or a vintage reproduction shop. But the easiest option is definitely online.

, Captain America's outfit includes a face mask as well as a helmet. Select a short mask that only covers the eyes and spray paint it the same shade of blue as the helmet. This could be as simple as a sleep mask or a sash of fabric. Nothing fancy is needed.


Alternatively, use a blue ski mask or blue swim cap. For a simplified, cheaper version of the mask, a blue ski mask that stops above the nose will also work and does not require the addition of a separate eye mask. You could also use a blue swim cap paired with swimming goggles.

, You could cut an ""A"" out of felt or make one out of silver or white duct tape. You might also be able to find a pre-made ""A"" as an iron-on patch or sticker. Adhere the ""A"" using glue or a needle and thread to the front center of your helmet, ski mask, or swim cap.


The ""A"" should be rather geometric-looking; no soft curves and curly-cues. It should resemble an 8 on a digital clock, but with a wider base.

, The gloves can be standard rubber kitchen gloves, or you can get use leather gloves for an ""updated"" or well-polished look. Either way, they should extend somewhere between your mid-forearm and elbow.

, If you went with leather gloves, leather combat boots are in order. If you went with rubber gloves, red rain boots or red sneakers paired with tall red socks might work better.


Whatever the overall look of your Captain America, keep it coordinated. If he's more like Captain America's poorer, shabbier-looking twin, make it work. As long as every piece is on the same level, your costume will look as one.

, For ease, consider a round saucer sled, large stockpot lid, or round metal garbage can lid. If none of these are available, you could also cut out a large circle from a thick piece of cardboard., Start by spray painting the shield white. The white paint acts as a primer and can also be used for the white stripe on the shield.


Paint the center blue. At the center of the shield, there should be a medium blue circle. The circle should take up about 1/3 of the total diameter of the shield.
Add two red stripes. Each one should be about 2 inches (5 cm) wide. The first stripe should encircle the center blue circle. The second stripe should border the edge of the shield. A large white stripe should be in between them both, but you may need to widen the red stripes if the white stripe is twice the size as either red stripe or larger. The red stripes can be created with paint or with colored duct tape (but tape is harder to make circular).

, The star should cover the entire area of the center blue circle but should not extend past the blue circle and into the red. It can be created with paint, decals, or white duct tape. Use whatever medium you've been using or match the star that's on your sternum.

, For the shorts there are two options. You can either wear plain dark blue high-waisted shorts or you can wear white high-waisted shorts.

Wear some sort of tiger costume.,
Try to act like a cat in general.,
Adopt Hobbes' mannerisms.",How to Dress Up As Hobbes from Calvin and Hobbes," A homemade one could consist of:

A long sleeved orange shirt and pants with black stripes drawn on.



 


White gloves and shoes for paws.






A headband with black cat ears on it.






Orange cloth to use as a tail.







Face paint: Paint your face white and your nose black (whiskers are optional).





;
, Hobbes was inspired by a house cat named Sprite, so he's really a tiger/cat mix. Here are few specific characteristics to imitate:
Pretend that tuna is your favorite food. Hobbes tends to prowl the house at night trying to find cans of tuna.






Lurk behind corners or doors waiting to pounce on people. Act like you are overjoyed to see them. Hobbes enjoys tackling Calvin when he gets home from school.







Nap often. Hobbes enjoys sleeping in and reading Calvin's comics while he is at school.







, Although Hobbes is an animal he has a lot of human qualities and habits as well.


Have lots of common sense. Hobbes refuses to cooperate when Calvin suggests something dangerous or daft.
Do not interfere with trouble-making beyond a few oblique warnings. After all you won't get in trouble, will you?
Insist that tigers are superior to humans. If someone asks you why humans exist, answer ""tiger food"" and grin evilly. Brag about tigers and your abilities constantly.
Be susceptible to girls, and mention ""smoochies"" often.
Be an intellectual. Be a great artist and help others with their homework. Hobbes often ends up doing Calvin's projects or reading his books.
Act kindly towards people and smile a lot. Hobbes is almost always polite.

Get a box.,
Remove the bottom of a large cardboard box.Use a box cutter or sharp pair of scissors to cut the cardboard away in a smooth, even line.,
Cut holes for the arms and head.,
Paint a white undercoat.,
Paint a color overcoat.,
Cut out circles of painted cardboard.You will need six even circles, each with a diameter that measures about 1/8 of the box height.,
Attach the circles to the box.,
Wear a matching color beneath the box.",How to Make a LEGO Costume1," The box must be tall enough to cover the entire torso of the intended wearer and about shoulder-wide.

Do not get a box that extends below the knees or past the elbows, as either trait will make it impossible to move around in. Ideally, the box will end just above the hips and at the shoulder line so that the wearer will still have no difficulties moving around.
The depth of the box should be no larger than the width, but you may opt for a box with a more shallow depth to make it easier to move around in. At a minimum, the box only needs to be deep enough for the intended wearer to fit into.;
,



 


Tape up the other sides of the box to prevent the cardboard flaps from coming loose.







, The hole for the head will need to be in the center of the top while the holes for the arms will need to be along the sides and toward the top.

Use a box cutter or sharp pair of scissors to cut circles out for the arms and head.






Begin with the head. Either gauge the space needed for the head or measure the diameter of the wearer's head with a ruler or tape measure. Cut the hole for the head as near to the middle of the top as possible.






Slip the box over the wearer before cutting out the arm holes. The exact distance from the top of the box to the top of the arm holes may vary depending on the individual wearing the costume, and so gauging it with the eye after slipping the box on is the best way to determine where the arm holes should go. Usually, this will be about 2-3 inches (5-7.6 cm) below the top of the box, along the sides. Each hole needs to be at least as wide as the widest part of the wearer's arm.







, Cover the top and all sides of the box with white spray paint or white acrylic craft paint.


The white paint creates a ""blank slate"" of sorts, making it easier for the final color to show accurately without being tinted by the color of the cardboard.






Use a non-glossy, matte paint. You need to use a type of paint that other paint will stick to, making matte paint a far better choice than glossy paint.







, Use spray paint or craft paint to cover the box with a primary color.

Red is the most classic color for a LEGO brick, but you could also paint the box blue or yellow. Multiple colors are an especially good idea if you have multiple people attending the same function as LEGO bricks. Opt for bright, solid shades, like ""fire engine"" red.






Both glossy and matte finishes work for this layer of paint, but spray paint is preferable to acrylic craft paint since paint applied by spray tends to be smoother than paint applied with brushes.






You may need multiple coats of paint, but applying the white layer before the color layer should reduce the total number of color coats.






Don't worry about getting paint on the inside of the box as you work. It makes no difference whether the inside of the box remains clean or gets accidentally coated in paint.







,

The circles should be primed with white paint and painted with the same color as the rest of the box.






A good idea is to save the cardboard bottom you cut out from the box, cut out your circles from that, and paint the circles using the same paint used on the rest of the costume. Additional cardboard may still be needed, though.
Use a stencil, cookie cutter, or compass to draw and cut out perfectly round circles.






Instead of using cardboard, you could also use round, shallow food tubs, like the kind holding ice cream or margarine. Paint these using spray paint or craft paint approved for use with plastic.







, Use a hot glue gun to secure the cardboard circles onto the front of the box in two columns with three rows each.

The columns and rows should all be evenly aligned, with even spacing between each one.






You may need to use a ruler or tape measure to mark out the two even columns and three even rows. Do this by dividing the width of the box into three even sections and the height into four even sections. Draw light pencil lines marking off each section, and place the center of one circle over each intersection of lines. Erase the lines when done.







, Before putting on the LEGO costume, the wearer should slip on a long-sleeve shirt and long pants that closely match the color of the box.


The shades do not need to be the exact same, but they should be similar. For instance, if you painted a bright red LEGO, wear clothes in other bright shades of red.

"
"
Create a LEGO brick body.,
Alter sonotube to create a head.Cut the sonotube so that the height is roughly 4 inches (10 cm) taller than the length between the base of the wearer's neck and the top of the wearer's head.,
Attach a small circle onto the top of the painted sonotube.,
Paint and divide two leg-length boxes.Spray paint two length-length boxes black or dark blue.,
Wear yellow mittens and black shoes.",How to Make a LEGO Costume2," The body of the LEGO man should be a basic LEGO brick without the circles or connecting links pasted on.


Remove the bottom from a torso-length and shoulder-width cardboard box. Cut holes out for the head and arms, and paint the box red.






If you feel a little more daring, you could try creating a shirt pattern on the front of the box. Spray paint the box white and draw a collar and two pockets on the front. Outline these features with black paint, and use a pencil and paintbrush to paint a red tie on the front.






Underneath the box, wear a long-sleeve shirt that matches the color of the cardboard torso.







, Cover the top of the sonotube with a cardboard circle and cut out two holes for the eyes.

Sonotube is a type of thick cardboard cylinder usually used for forming round concrete columns. You can use any cardboard or styrofoam cylinder large enough to fit over your head, however.






Place the sonotube over a flat piece of cardboard and trace a circle that perfectly matches the diameter of the tube. Cut this circle out with scissors or a box cutter and glue it to the sonotube with craft glue or hot glue.






Gauge where the eye holes need to be by holding the sonotube next to the wearer's head. Use a pencil to mark off where they eye level of the LEGO head needs to be. Draw and cut out your eye holes at this level.






Spray paint the entire cylinder yellow. Draw a smile beneath the eye holes using black paint and a paintbrush.







, Paint a small, thin, round container or circular piece of cardboard yellow and glue it to the top of the sonotube.

The circle should be half the diameter of the sonotube.






Use craft glue or hot glue to attach the circle to the sonotube. The two centers should be aligned.







, Cut the boxes in half at knee-height and fix them together with heavy-duty craft wire.

The boxes should be just wide enough for the wearer's legs to fit through and just long enough to reach from the top of the leg to the top of the foot. Make sure that the boxes are snug on the wearer's legs to help keep them in place.






Cutting the box in half at the knee allows the wearer to bend at the knee. Punch even holes in the top and bottom of each half and thread wire through the holes to connect the two halves together. The wire will keep the leg halves together while allowing the wearer to continue bending the knee.






Also connect the legs to the torso box using the same heavy-duty craft wire. Punch a hole in the bottom of the torso box on each side and another hole in the tops of each top leg halves.







, Use thin yellow mittens to mimic the appearance of LEGO man hands. Wear shoes that match the color of your LEGO man pants, whether those are black or blue.

Make sure to wear mittens, not gloves. You should not wear anything that has separate fingers.

You can also go for gowns in luxurious looking fabrics like satin, lace, and chiffon.If you still want to appear dramatic and glamorous like Barbie, but you aren’t comfortable in long gowns, you can still wear shorter dresses that sit just below your knees.

Compliment your night out look with a small pink sparkly clutch or a small shoulder purse.You can give your purse an extra element of Barbie by including a keychain on it that says Barbie or a fuzzy pink keychain to symbolize Barbie.

, Accessorize your Barbie look with sparkly jewellery or possibly real diamonds. A gemstone or diamond necklace, as well as diamond earrings, can really add some Barbie glamour to your look.

, Barbie is all about fun and bold statement pieces, like a faux fur stole to compliment her dress or a faux fur jacket in a bold pink shade. Cap off your night out look with a unique and interesting statement piece to really rock the Barbie style., If you do not have blonde hair but are looking for the classic Barbie look, you may consider buying a blonde wig to look even more like Barbie.

Do a center part so your hair more closely resembles Barbie and use hairspray to remove any fly aways or frizzy hairs. You want to achieve a very clean and perfect hair look.To change up your Barbie hair look, you may want to curl the ends of your hair with a curling iron.

A few popular—and free—patterns can be found here:

Creeper head: http://stlmotherhood.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/CREEPER-Mask-and-sides.pdf

Enderman head: http://pixelpapercraft.com/papercraft/50904699f7e521e71f00003c/life-size-enderman-head



Alternatively, you can use any high-resolution image of the desired character's head and enlarge all five sides to a size of 11-inches by 11-inches (28-cm by 28-cm).;
, Take the saved pattern to copy shop and print off all five sides of the head.


If you have a large printer with plenty of ink at home, you might be able print the pattern yourself. For most people, however, your local copy shop is a better option.
Print the patterns in poster setting with a tile scale of 100% and an overlap of 0.005 inches (0.0127 mm). The pattern will need to be printed on 11-inch by 17-inch (28-cm by 43-cm) paper., You'll need a cardboard box shaped as an 11-inch (28-cm) cube.


You can either buy an 11-inch (28-cm) cubical box or trim down a larger box so until all three dimensions (length, width, height) are 11 inches (28 cm) long.
Tape the bottom of the box closed, if necessary.
Fold the flaps on the top side into the box to create an opening. If the flaps threaten to fall back down when the box is inverted, tape them to the inside of the box.

, Turn the box upside-down so that the closed bottom is now the top. Coat the new top with spray adhesive or glue from a standard glue stick, then carefully press the hair portion of the pattern onto the box.


Note that you will need to trim off any excess white paper from the pattern image before adhering the image to the box.
There will probably be some overlap onto the sides of the box. You can hold this overlap down with additional glue or clear tape.

, Work around all four sides of the box, gluing the rest of the head portion on one side at a time.


As with the hair, you will need to trim away any excess white paper before gluing the pattern images to the side of the box.
Use spray adhesive or a standard glue stick to adhere the pattern pieces to the box.
Make sure that the pattern pieces match up appropriately. In other words, the back image of the head should lie on the opposite side of the box as the face image, the left side image should be to the left of the face, and the right side image should be to the right of the face.

, Use a box cutter or utility knife to cut out the two square eyes at the front of the face image. This will create eye holes for the wearer to see through.


At this point, the head portion of the costume should be finished and read to wear.

, Minecraft Steve wears an aqua t-shirt and standard blue jeans.A light blue t-shirt could also work if you are unable to find an aqua shirt.
Tuck the shirt into the jeans around the right front side. Leave it un-tucked on the left side and in the back.

, The game character wears dark gray shoes, so if you have gray or black sneakers, those would be your best choice for this costume.

, Use scissors to cut out enough squares to cover the arms, legs, and torso of the costume wearer's body.s


You'll need to use four to five different shades of green.
The exact number of felt squares you'll need will vary depending on the size of the wearer. For a small boy's costume, you will need approximately 30 sheets of 8-inch by 11-inch (20-cm by 28-cm) felt.
Try to keep the consistently sized. Cut them out so that they are approximately 3 inches (7.6 cm) to 4 inches (10 cm) in length/width.

, Glue the squares of green felt onto a green sweatshirt and green sweatpants. Use a hot glue gun for best results.


If you are unable to find a green sweat suit, opt for a gray or black one.
Arrange the squares side by side and randomize the pattern as well as possible.
Only apply a small dab of glue to all four corners of each square before sticking it to the material.

, Green sneakers are hard to come by, but gray or black shoes will work adequately well for this costume.

, Endermen are entirely black, so the body of the costume should consist of a long-sleeve black t-shirt, black pants, and black shoes.


Endermen also have notable long arms, so you could mimic this effect by wearing an oversized long-sleeve shirt with arms that extend well below your waist.

, Endermen are often seen carrying blocks in the game, so you can enhance the costume by carrying around a small cubical box or block.


Consider painting the block to look like dirt, grass, gravel, sand, or TNT.
Alternatively, you can carry around a fake flower. Endermen can carry tulips, orchids, dandelions, poppies, and other flowers in the game, making this another worthwhile accessory for your costume.

, You should be able to find free patterns for the player's diamond sword and diamond pickaxe online, but you may also be able to create them on your computer. Save the pattern to a thumb drive once you find the right one.


Go to your favorite search engine and try searching along the lines of ""free Minecraft pickaxe pattern"" or ""diamond sword costume printable.""
You can find free printable patterns here:

Diamond Pickaxe: http://kerryannmorgan.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Minecraft-pickaxe-template-pdf.pdf

Diamond sword blade: http://kerryannmorgan.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/diamond-sword-template-1-pdf.pdf

Diamond sword handle: http://kerryannmorgan.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/minecraft-diamond-sword-2-pdf.pdf



Another option is to find high-resolution images of the diamond pickaxe and/or diamond sword and enlarge them on your computer until they are roughly 11 inches (28 cm) wide by 17 inches (43 cm) long.

, Print the patterns onto 11-inch by 17-inch (28-cm by 43-cm) paper.If your home printer is capable of printing onto paper that large, you can print the patterns out at home. Consider using heavy cardstock or photograph paper to maximize the image quality.
Another option would be to take the files to your local copy shop and print them out there. The image quality will be better, and if you're already going there to print out the patterns for the costume head, you can get these patterns printed out during the same trip.

, Use scissors to cut around the images in the pattern.


Trim off as much excess blank space as possible.
You should cut around the images, but you do not need to worry about cutting around every block during this step. The only place you need to be precise at are the edges where separate pieces (the blade image and the handle image) will join together. Open edges can be roughly cut.

, Lightly coat the back of each pattern image with spray adhesive, then firmly press the image onto foam core board. Allow the glue to dry.


A standard glue stick can be used instead of spray adhesive if desired.
Use foam core board instead of using craft foam board. Foam core board is stiffer and more durable, making it ideal for use with costume accessories.
Arrange the separate pieces of each tool onto the foam board in the proper order. In other words, the handle of each tool must be centered and connected to the blade of the corresponding tool. If necessary, use a metal L-ruler to match the angle of the handle to the angle of the blade.

, Use a utility knife to cut round the entire perimeter of each tool. Once the tool is cut, it should be ready to use for your costume.


During this step, you will need to make precise cuts around each block of the perimeter.
Place the foam onto a hard garage floor or cutting board before cutting out the pieces. You will need to apply enough pressure for the knife to cut cleanly through both the paper and foam.

Find and paint a yellow shirt with brown stripes.,
Find or buy a pair of yellow pants.,
Add some shoes.,
Prepare the ears.,
Make a tail.,
Paint your face.,
Add a few extras.",How to Dress Up as Pikachu from Pokemon," If you don’t have a yellow t-shirt on hand, you can either purchase one from a clothing store or dye a white t-shirt/long sleeve shirt with yellow fabric dye. You want to make sure that you find a shade that closely matches the color of Pikachu’s fur, which is a bright school bus yellow. After this, paint three brown stripes on the back.These stripes should be horizontal and 2-3 inches thick. You also want to make sure they go from one side of your back to the other in a semi-oval shape.
If you don’t have brown paint, you can also use black.;
, You can choose either jeans, leggings, or sweatpants. However, you want to make sure that you are matching the shade of yellow to the color of your shirt. If you can’t find the exact shade, just try to get it as close as you can. You also want to use a pair you don’t mind ruining with glue and paint as you’ll be attaching a tail to them later.

, Any type of shoe works, though yellow flats or slippers work best as they somewhat resemble Pikachu's feet. If you don't have yellow flats or slippers, just go for any kind of yellow shoe or sneaker. Try to avoid sandals, though - Pikachu doesn't have human toes and you shouldn't show yours off!


Cheap tennis/canvas shoes are really easy to color yellow with markers, or dye.

, If you can’t or don’t want to buy Pikachu ears, feel free to make your own. A yellow headband and cardboard works – just color the cardboard yellow and the tips black and fold it into a cone-like shape, then glue it onto the headband.


You can also use felt and black paint. Simply cut the felt into the shape of Pikachu’s ears, making sure you have four pieces - two for each ear. Then hot glue the sides together and stuff them with cotton or crumpled paper., The simplest way to do this is with cardboard. Simply cut a large piece into a lightning bolt shape and then color most of it yellow except for the very bottom. You want the part that attaches to your pants to be brown. Once you’ve finished, you can either stick the tail in a back pocket, tape/staple it, or hot glue it on.


Similar to the ears, you can also use felt to make the tail. For example, take a large yellow piece of felt and cut two mirror lightning bolt shapes. Then, hot glue the edges together and stuff it with cotton and crumpled paper. Since this tail will be heavier, you may want to hot glue the tail to your pants in multiple places., You should be able to find a makeup or face paint kit in any craft store like JoAnn Fabrics or Michael’s. You can also find them on Amazon for around $10-$15. Once you match a yellow to the rest of your outfit, paint the entirety of your face with it - avoiding your eyes. Then, use red paint or blush to paint your cheeks. Since you want the color on your cheeks to be a perfect circle, try tracing the bottom of a glass or similar round object before you paint it in with red. Once you’ve finished your cheeks, paint the tip of your nose black.


If you don’t feel comfortable painting your whole face, feel free to only paint your cheeks and nose.
Whichever face paint you use, make sure you aren’t allergic to any of the ingredients first.

, If you really want to push it, (say you're going to a Halloween party), get some yellow gloves and paint whatever part of your body isn't covered yellow. Or, get a long-sleeved shirt and long pants to be completely covered.

Tuck the tip of the bandana or handkerchief into the shirt.,
Put the hoodie on over the button-down shirt.,
Wrap a sash around your waist.,
Wear several belts.",How to Make an Assassin's Creed Costume1," If you want to dress like a traditional assassin, you should cut the sleeves off of a white hooded sweatshirt. The ""hoodie"" will be worn over a button-down shirt to create the Assassin's Creed hood and tunic.


You can also decorate the hoodie using brass studs, patches, or any bits of ""assassin"" flare that you may have around the house.;
, Put the shirt on as you normally would, but do not button it all the way to the top. Instead, leave the top two or three buttons undone.

, Fold the bandana or handkerchief in half diagonally and wrap it loosely around your neck. When the bandana or handkerchief is tied, you want it to drape over your throat.


Red and white are the colors that are typically associated with the ""Assassin's Order,"" but that is not a rule.Feel free to use any color scheme that you like.

, The bandana or handkerchief should be tucked in so that it covers the area of the chest that has been left exposed by the shirt.

, Do not zip it all the way up, however. Instead, leave it partially open to expose the bandana and the collar of the button-down shirt that you are wearing underneath.

, Although this is not absolutely necessary, it will add to the overall aesthetic of your assassin costume. Wrap the sash around your body so that the loose ends come to drape freely to one side your body.


If you do not have a sash, you can use a bright colored t-shirt. Since you will not be able to wrap it around your waist, simply fold the t-shirt in half and tuck the the sleeve-end into one of your belts so that it drapes freely to one side of your body., Don't thread the belts through any belt loops. Instead, wrap the belts around the base of the hoodie and over the sash so that they are fully exposed. The more belts the better.


Assassin's are known for carrying an array of weapons and tools on them at all times.This, of course, required them to craft their own holsters, pouches, and pockets.
A small-sized hip or ""fanny"" pack would make the perfect accessory pouch for an assassin.

Download the pattern here: ""Connor's Hood Template,"" by ""Yulittle."", One will be used for the right side of the hood, and the other for the left., Using sharp scissors, cut the patterns out as neatly as you possibly can. The neater you can trim the patterns, the easier it will be to lineup the edges of the hood pieces.

, The more wrinkles that you can work out, the easier it will be to pin and trim your patterns.

, Carefully arrange the patterns on the fabric one at a time. Be sure that the patterns are laying perfectly flat on top of the fabric.

, Sewing pins (not needles) have a round ball at the end opposite the tip. This helps hold the pin in place and prevents it from sliding out of the fabric or pattern.

, Use tailor's chalk to make sure that you do not stain the fabric. Do your best to make clean lines.

, This margin will be your seem allowance, which has not been included in the pattern., The first section that should be sewn together is the back-right section of the hood. Start with the two straight and narrow pieces.


Be sure to lineup the outline marks that you made with the tailor's chalk to ensure that the pieces are properly aligned before they are sewn together.

, Sew on the third and final piece to finish constructing the back-right section of your hood.


Do not trim off any of the excess. These margins will continue to provide you with a seam allowance as you sew all the pieces of your hood together.

, Just as you did with the back-right side, sew together the three panels that will form the back-left portion of your hood.


Start with the two straight and narrow pieces.
You will be constructing five sections that will need to be sewn together to form the final hood.

, Each side section (left and right) of the hood will be composed of three pattern parts that will need to be sewn together.


Start with the bottom two pieces of the section.

, Sew on the final piece of the section to complete the section.

, Once you have completed constructing the other side of the hood, you will be ready to begin sewing together all of the sections.


You should now have four separate sections: left, back-left, right, and back-right.

, Start by sewing the right sections of the hood together. Be sure to align the adjoining edges up as best as you can to make sure that all of the pieces of the hood are aligned properly.

, Just as you did with the right, sew the left two sections of the hood together.

, You should now have a left and right side that is ready to be sewn together. As straight as you can, sew the left and right sides together beginning in the back of the hood. Stop just as the seam begins to deviate, forming a diamond cutaway.

, This diamond piece will form the pointed beak that has become the trademark of an assassin's hood.


If your sewing skills are up to it, try making a liner for the hood in a contrasting color.Traditionally, assassins wore pure white with crimson red highlights, but this was never a rule and was often deviated from.

Measure the size of your arm to determine the dimensions of your vambrace.,
Measure the diameter of your forearm at its widest point.Just as you did with the wrist, use a tape measure to measure the diameter of your forearm at its widest point.,
Measure the distance between your wrist and the widest point on your forearm.Measure the distance between your wrist and the exact same point where you took your first measurement.,
Begin drawing the vambrace pattern on the inside of the leather.,
Mark the centerline.,
Draw another line that is perpendicular to the center line.,
Make indicator dots for the connecting edges of the vambrace.,
Use a straight edge to connect the dots.,
Cut the pattern out.Using a rotary cutter and a straight edge, or a razor, cut the trapezoid pattern out.,
Create a guiding line for the eyelets.,
Use a leather punch tool to create eyelets along the guiding line.,
Lace up the vambrace.,
Decorate your vambrace with brass studs.,
Continue customizing your vambrace.",How to Make an Assassin's Creed Costume3," Begin by using a measuring tape to measure the diameter of your wrist.,


This should be just a few inches before the bend of your elbow.

, This measurement will determine the length of your vambrace.

, Using tailor's chalk, draw a straight line on the inside of your leather, synthetic leather, or suede.The length of the line should match the measurement that you took in step one. This line will be the wrist edge of your vambrace.


Real leather can be expensive if purchased in large quantities. It can, however, be purchased as sample sheets and scraps for significantly reduced prices.
Ostrich and alligator leather can also be purchased in samples and have very unique texture surfaces. Perfect for making your vambrace stand out.

, Starting in the exact center point of the line that you just made, draw a perpendicular line that matches the measurement that you took in step three. This is the centerline.


If the measurement you took in step three was nine-inches, then you want to make your perpendicular line nine-inches long as well.
You should have a ""T"" that appears to be on its side.

, This line should be drawn so that it matches the measurement that you took in step two; and so that it forms another sideways ""T"" intersection.


The distance between the two parallel lines should match the measurement that you took in step three. These will be the wrist and elbow edges of your vambrace.

, Do this by making small ticks or hashmarks that are a half-inch from the endpoints of the parallel lines. Each line has two endpoints, so you should make four ticks or hashmark.

, Draw a straight line to connect the dots that you made on each of the parallel lines. Once you are done, you should have a trapezoid shape that has been sized to the dimensions of your arm.

, Leather shears will work, but are not necessary for working with synthetics.

, Using a straight edge, draw a line that parallels the edge of your vambrace. Leave at least a quarter-inch gap between the edge of the vambrace and the guiding line. Do this on both edges, on both vambraces.

, Begin a half-inch from the wrist-edge of your vambrace and continue working your way up to the forearm, leaving approximately an inch between each eyelet.


The exact amount of eyelets in your vambrace and their spacing is entirely up to you.
Leather punch tools can be purchased relatively inexpensive online. Or, you can use a drill.
Avoid ""cutting"" the eyelets. Straight cuts will eventually tear, so be sure to use a leather punch to create circular openings in the leather., Just as you would a shoe, begin lacing up your vambrace with a leather shoestring. Begin at the wrist and work your way toward the forearm.


If the tip of the shoestring has been frayed, wrap it with some masking tape. This will make it easier to insert into the eyelets.

, Since vambraces and ""hidden blades"" are unique to each assassin, the exact number of studs and their placement is entirely up to you.


Brass studs come in a variety of shapes and sizes and can be purchased at your local craft store.
Some studs will need to be pushed into the leather, while others will need to be glued. Follow the instructions that come with your studs to be sure that they are properly installed.

, Depending on the type of leather you choose, you may want to decorate your vambrace to make it stand out. This means you can decorate your vambrace to represent any time period or civilization that you choose.Remember, each assassin is unique.


Try embossing or stamping patterns and designs into the leather.
Try adding a leather strap and buckle to your vambrace.

Choose your Zelda.,
Find game-specific character art for the Zelda you wish to cosplay.",How to Dress As Princess Zelda from the Legend of Zelda1," Generally Zelda is depicted as a blue-eyed, blonde young woman wearing an ankle-length pink or white dress. She has a jeweled diadem, wears golden pauldrons (shoulder armor) with a gold chain suspended between them like a necklace, and has a banner with the Triforce falling from her hips held up by a golden belt. She may also wear gold Triforce earrings.;
, This will provide detailed front, back and side character and costume sketches. Below are the important main details of each Zelda.


The Legend of Zelda and Zelda II Zeldas only appear briefly. Atop their permed blonde hair is a simple gold chain with a suspended red jewel that lies directly over the forehead. They also wear a red bead necklace, and a pink dress with long sleeves and puffed shoulders. Zelda II's Zelda has a white ribbon and bow trim along the hem of the dress.

Link to the Past Zelda wears a red beaded necklace, spiked golden diadem and Triforce earrings. Her white dress has short sleeves striped with two thin teal lines, a pink torso and a single thick teal stripe near the hem of her dress. She also has a pink apron like-garment that overlaps her skirt. The apron is pink, bordered in orange, and features a red Triforce design. This Zelda wears small golden pauldrons linked by a chain that runs across her collarbone, and extended gold cuffs that cover her arm from wrist to mid-forearm. Her red and gold belt is thick, and has two crests with golden tassels on her left and right hip. Her blonde hair falls freely, except for two pieces that lie in front of her ears.
Zelda from the Ocarina of Time has two versions: a young version and an older version. Young Zelda wears a white dress with sky-blue long sleeves, puffed to the elbow, and has a pink sleeveless over-tunic that bears the Triforce. A golden chain belts her waist, while simple gold bangles adorn both arms. She also wears a gold necklace with a red jewel in the center, and a simple white and pink head cloth with a Triforce medallion on her upper forehead. Her hair is completely tucked under this head cloth. Older Zelda wears a sleeveless dress with a two pink stripes, one thick and the other thin, near the hemline. Her pink over-tunic no longer extends past her waist; the familiar Triforce banner hangs from the gold chain instead. She also now wears opera-length gloves and linked pauldrons, and her strawberry blonde hair resembles that of Link to the Past Zelda.

Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons Zelda wears a sleeveless, Mandarin-collared pale pink dress. The upper portion (torso) is a darker lilac color that dips in the back like a shirt-tail hem tunic. Her dress has a lilac stripe border near the hem, and she wears a white cape. Her accessories are similar to previous Zeldas: Triforce apron (in red, blue and gold), opera-length pink gloves, golden diadem, gold pauldrons with chain, golden belt and Triforce earrings. Her hair is the same as previous Zeldas.

Four Swords Zelda is very similar to the Oracle Zelda, except for her hairstyle and pauldrons. She has a ponytail with a small gold comb at the base, along with two red bat-ear like additions flaring from the comb. The pauldrons are absent, however, the golden chain still remains as an adornment for the neckline of her dress.

The Wind Waker, Minish Cap and Spirit Tracks Zeldas all share a similar design. Their dress is dark pink on the torso portion, has a lilac skirt, and is sleeveless. A hint of a white undershirt shows at the sides of the dress near the underarms, and a jagged dark purple stripe runs near the hem of the dress. The Triforce hangs from a chunky golden belt, and while the pauldrons are absent the collarbone-skimming golden chain is present and anchors a lilac cowl. Opera-length white gloves, two triangular hair ornaments evoking the wind behind each ear, a thick red beaded necklace, and a red-jeweled diadem are the main accessories. These Zeldas' blonde hair flows freely, and also has two frontal sections lying over each ear.

Twilight Princess and Super Smash Bros Zeldas are blueish grey-eyed brunettes with white ribbon-wrapped front hair and a partial French braid. They wear a sleeveless white dress embroidered along the bottom with the royal crest and hemmed with gold. Like many other Zeldas a purple tunic-like garment covers their torso, and a Triforce banner hangs from their hips by a gold belt. The accessories are also similar to past Zeldas but more ornate in detail: opera-length gloves (with subtle embroidery details on the back of the hand and cuffs), jeweled golden pauldrons with chain, and a jeweled belt and diadem. The earrings appear to be thick iron rings, with a small gold triangle on the bottom. They are commonly pictured holding a sword.

Skyward Sword Zelda, unlike previous games, is not a princess. She is pictured wearing a pink long sleeve dress that hits below the knee, topped with a white shawl. The dress has a rectangular yellow border along the hem and sleeves, and the neckline has yellow polygon-like details. In the center of her dress' bust is a blue diamond. She wears a gold medallion chain and brown wrap belt around her waist, and a blue Triforce banner edged with a sky blue border sits on her right hip. This Zelda wears practical knee-high brown boots with a fold-over top, and gold bangles on both arms. Her hair is blonde, with the two front sections and the low ponytail part wrapped in blue ribbons.

Be detail-oriented.,
Volunteer at a museum or similar institution.,
Get your undergraduate degree.,
Get your graduate degree.,
Adopt a research project and publish it.,
Be willing to work your way up.,
Consider getting your PhD.",How to Become a Museum Curator," While curators at smaller museums are jacks-of-all-trades, most museum curators are experts in a particular area of the arts, sciences or history. Your particular area of interest may stem from childhood, or you may acquire it as you begin your formal studies.


If you have several related areas of interest, you may want to investigate several of them further. This will help you broaden your eventual job search to both smaller, local and larger, national museums.;
, Coupled with the ability to serve as an expert or handle a wide range of duties is the ability to pay attention to small details. Being detail-oriented will serve you in handling such duties as figuring out the best way to preserve a waterlogged wooden artifact, tracking inventory and submitting an object to radioactive dating or X-ray analysis to find out where and when it was created.

, In addition to stimulating your interest in your planned area of expertise, you'll gain an inside understanding of how the kind of institution you want to work for works. You'll definitely want to intern at a museum while in college, but you may also want to look at opportunities to be a docent while still in high school to whet your interest and wet your feet.

, To become a museum curator, you'll most likely want to major in history or art history for your bachelor's degree. In addition to museum studies, you'll also want skills in chemistry and physics, design, business administration, human resources, marketing and public relations. You'll need to sharpen your writing skills for publication in scholarly journals, for writing texts or audio tracks to accompany public displays and to request grants to fund research projects. You may also want to learn one or more foreign languages.

, In addition to history or art history, areas you may wish to get your master's degree in include curatorship, restoration science and chemistry. With the right undergraduate background, an MBA is also a valid graduate degree when seeking to become a museum curator.


You may want to have more than one master's, each in a separate specialization, to increase your marketability as a museum curator.

, Publication credits are important in getting recognition as an expert in your field, which in turn can lead to becoming a curator.

, Just as many businesses promote from within, so do many museums. You may work your way up from cataloger or restorer to curatorial assistant to curator.

, If you plan to become the curator of a national museum or deal in more science-related fields of study, your opportunities will be better if you get a PhD. For other museum curator positions, it isn't as necessary.

Visit the galleries more than once.,
Familiarize yourself with the dealers.,
Develop a relationship with trusted dealers.,
Negotiate the purchase price.,
Know about your payment options.",How to Buy Art," If you begin at art fairs, you will learn to what you are drawn and the galleries that carry those artists. Art fairs will give you a starting point so that you can narrow your gallery search down and save a lot of time visiting ones that don't feature what you want;
, Shopping for art can be compared to shopping for any other large purchase. Go back to the galleries that have the pieces that interest you and take note of the prices they want because, if you are visiting local art galleries, they will most likely carry the similar pieces by the same artist and you can get the best deal.

, Once you've pared the list of galleries down to a few ones that you like, don't be afraid to talk to the dealers and ask others about them. This will give you an idea of who you like and who is most trusted by getting opinions and learning of past experiences.

, There is immense value in being a valued customer. When shopping for art, nurse a rapport with gallery owners so that they will make you aware of the best values and the newest pieces coming into the gallery before other buyers.

, Artwork can be expensive, and the prices are very often negotiable. After you have compared values at a few art galleries, you will have a good idea what a piece is worth and can make an offer that you and the dealer will both feel is fair.

, Inexperienced buyers often believe that they have to walk in and pay for the piece in full, up front. This isn't the case, and you should find out what your payment options are as well as the dealer's return and exchange policies.

, Modern furniture involving only minimal wood can be a base to go for frame-less canvas prints or gallery wrap paintings. For a room with minimalist furniture, go for something bright.

Offer light refreshments.",How to Set Up an Art Exhibition," A good art exhibition should be characterized by a prominent theme that ties the different pieces together and makes them feel like part of a larger whole. Think carefully about the message you want your exhibition to convey. It could be an image or phenomenon, a feeling or a certain visual technique.The more specific your theme, the better. For instance, “Black and White” is too general to make much of an impact, whereas “Isolation and Womanhood” explores a far more interesting pairing of ideas.
Consider giving your exhibition a name. A catchy title like “Neon Daydreams” will help generate attention and point more clearly to the theme being presented.;
, Pick out a few of your best or most recent pieces to put on display. If you’re holding a solo exhibit meant to highlight your own work, you’ll need to have anywhere from 10-30 individual pieces to show. The theme of the exhibition should be represented in each production.Spend the months leading up to the exhibition creating original pieces that you can unveil for the first time on opening night.Plan on exhibiting more pieces if the work you do tends to be on the small side.

, Do some research into other artists in your area and see whether they would be interested in taking part in your exhibition. Collaborative efforts can be a great opportunity for many different artists to showcase their art at the same event, resulting in a more diverse and well-rounded display.Narrow your focus to artists who have a similar style or tend to produce works related to the theme you’re presenting.
Holding an exhibition in conjunction with other artists will also allow you to split the cost of the venue, licensing expenses, framing and promotional materials.Be sure to give other artists proper credit for the works they've contributed.

, Your exhibition doesn’t have to exclusively feature paintings or sketches. Feel free to solicit works from photographers, sculptors, and other types of visual artists. A wide-ranging selection of works will lend collaborations a dynamic atmosphere and give your patrons more to enjoy.


In general, it’s best to stick with art you can frame, hang and sell. However, you might also consider inviting poets or musicians to perform at the event, especially if their work complements the exhibition’s theme.

, Organizing an art exhibition requires an exhaustive amount of coordination, so be realistic about the timeframe you impose on yourself. You’ll want to start planning your event at least 2-3 months in advance to give yourself plenty of time to get prepared. If possible, choose a date near the weekend when more people will be off from work and looking for things to do around town.Avoid scheduling your exhibition on or around holidays that might force you to compete for the attention of the public.You’ll need to have a clear date worked out before you can move on to other phases of planning, such as reserving a venue and advertising.

, Begin searching for a suitable location to hold your exhibition. One obvious option is to rent out studio or gallery space, but keep in mind that you’re not limited to traditional art venues—you can also ask around at restaurants, cafes, community centers, churches and area business and see if they’d be willing to help host your event.Holding your first exhibition in a more casual setting, like a restaurant or coffee house, can help you get over your jitters.Make sure the location you choose is clean, well-lit and large enough to comfortably hold all the art you plan to display.

, The goal of an exhibition is not just to showcase an artist’s work but to sell it. Once you have pieces to put on display, you can think about how much you want to charge for them. Try to set prices that are fair to both you and the buyer, taking into consideration factors like the medium, technical complexity and the labor that went into producing the piece.If you’re collaborating with other artists, you’ll have to work with them to come up with prices for the pieces they’ve contributed.
Not everyone will be able to afford a full-sized painting or original photograph. That’s why it’s a good idea to keep less expensive items on hand, such as smaller works, sketches and print reproductions that you can sell for a lower price., Print posters, flyers, pamphlets and one-page informational ads that briefly describe the nature of the exhibition and the kind of artwork that can be seen there. Be sure to include key details like the time and date, venue, dress code and entrance cost (if applicable). If your exhibition is going to be a high-profile event, you might even consider doing a press release or interview with your local news network.Post your advertisements in public places like the local university or art school, coffee shops, clubs or even the community bulletin board at the supermarket.
Mail out photo cards with the artists’ bios and samples of their work as personalized invitations., Let the people around you know that you have an exhibition in the works. This might involve making an announcement in person or posting the event info on your social media accounts. In some cases, you may even be able to collaborate with the venue to reach a larger audience through their website, press releases or official advertisements.Use media sharing apps like Instagram, Snapchat and Tumblr to preview works from your upcoming show.You can also have your friends, family, classmates or coworkers help spread the news about your exhibition by word of mouth.

, Enlist the aid of volunteers, along with professionals like movers, framers and lighting experts. Together, you’ll have an easier time coordinating art dropoffs and pickups, getting the necessary equipment and displays into place and keeping an eye on the artwork to keep it from being damaged or stolen. A dedicated crew can ease the burden of trying to do everything yourself and ensure that the event goes off without a hitch.In addition to movers, it may also be a good idea to hire a photographer or videographer to capture the event on film, and a band or DJ to provide subtle musical accompaniment.
Delegate odd tasks and responsibilities to your team of volunteers to take care of any last-minute preparations.

, Your first order of business will be getting the artwork mounted and situated properly. From there, you can fine-tune the lighting to make sure that each piece is well-lit and plainly visible. Envision how you want your visitors to view and interact with the room, then construct a final layout that fulfills this purpose.The theme of your exhibition should be reflected in the floorplan. For an installation on institutional oppression, for example, you might put up signs or ropes to restrict and control your guests’ movement.Don’t forget to designate space for a meet-and-greet area, merchandise tables or any other resources you think you’ll need., As visitors begin arriving, make yourself available to answer questions and describe the artwork that awaits them. This is often the most exciting part of the exhibition for most artists, as it will give you the opportunity to meet the people who will be buying and critiquing your artwork, discuss the finer points of your style and shed some light on your creative process.If you have pieces on display yourself, be sure to stay close so that you can be easily identified as the artist.
Art exhibitions are social events at their core, so don’t be afraid to socialize and have a good time., Provide a few foods and beverages for your guests to enjoy as they take in the exhibition. Simple offerings like cheese, fruit, finger sandwiches and wine will be enough in most cases. If you’re expecting a large crowd, you might spring for cocktail shrimp, miniature quiches, hummus and other more substantial crowd-pleasers.Like the rest of the exhibition, your menu should be planned with your venue in mind, as well as the mood you’re attempting to set (casual or formal) and the expected turnout.
More established art galleries will sometimes cover the cost of catering big events.

Choose the design you want to use.,

Sketch the design outline on paper.,
Draw your design outline in chalk on the floor.,
Thicken the outline of your design with white chalk.,
Create an adhesive surface if you are using black paper.,
Give dimension to your outline with a white, textured material.,
Choose the materials you will use to fill in your design.,
Fill the inside of your Rangoli with your chosen materials.,
Mix different textures and colors in your design.,
Add the final touches.",How to Make Rangoli," Rangoli can be made in any number of designs, but whether you choose a simple or complex design, most are symmetrical. You can use a plant or animal for inspiration, or you can create your own geometric design.


Depending on your skill level as an artist, you can choose small, basic geometric or floral designs, or venture into designing larger, more complex animals, gods, or goddesses (like the Hindu goddess Lakshmi, who is traditionally honored during Diwali).Flowers such as the lotus are very popular for Rangoli. Some other traditional designs are fish, snakes, tridents, and the peacock - India’s national bird.;
, You can draw it on a flat, dry floor inside or outside of your home, or you can draw it on paper to display anywhere.


The earliest Rangoli were created in small 2x2 patterns, but can now be any size, even covering entire floors. The size of your design can help determine where you should draw your Rangoli.If you’re just starting out, it is best to create your Rangoli on black paper, since there is more room for error on an erasable surface. The bright colors of your design will stand out beautifully against the black background. If you go this route, glue the paper to a piece of cardboard to give it some backing and structure.
If you decide to make your Rangoli on the floor, be sure to do it in a place that won’t disturb normal walking routes.

, Use a pencil and eraser to practice drawing the outline of your Rangoli on black or white paper. Keep practicing until you are happy with your design.


If you are creating the Rangoli on black paper, feel free to practice the design on the black paper you’re using for the finished piece. Just make sure to sketch lightly so you can easily erase any lines if needed.

, If you are not making your Rangoli on black paper, you will need to draw a basic outline on the floor, or wherever you are creating your Rangoli. Draw the outline in thin, light chalk lines.


Draw the chalk outline lightly just in case you need to erase any mistakes.

, This is good for beginners, as the white chalk helps cleanly and clearly define the borders of the design. Experienced Rangoli artists can skip this step.


If you’ve already drawn a thin outline on the ground, darken it with one more layer of chalk.
Using white for the outline is traditional in India. White is a sign of peace and purity, and it will also make the finished Rangoli look brighter and more polished.

, If you’re creating a Rangoli on black paper, you’ll need a surface that the textured materials can stick to. Add a small amount of any cooking oil to your entire design to help the materials stick.Don’t douse the paper in cooking oil. Just apply a little oil to the tip of a finger and follow the chalk outlines of your design. Then, use the same method to apply a little more oil to the inside of your chalk outline.

, It is customary to use natural substances like semolina, rice, or sand.


To easily and cleanly pour the textured material onto your chalk outline, roll a piece of newspaper into a cone, snip a hole in the narrow end, and fill the hole with the material. Using your finger as a stopper with which to control the flow, follow the borders you’ve drawn to outline your design.
Experts can add dimension by hand, rubbing the material between the thumb and forefingers and following the lines of the design., Rangoli can be filled in with any number of colorful household materials like spices and grains, or with store-bought materials like pre-colored Rangoli powder.


It is traditional to use colorful, natural items like turmeric, chiles, grains, and even pasta.
You can also use natural materials found outside, like flower petals and dried leaves.Another option is to use ground up chalk, or even colorful powders specifically designed for making Rangoli.

, Use the paper cone or your fingers to completely fill your Rangoli with the chosen materials. This is the most interesting step, and usually the most fun.


To fill in your Rangoli, you may utilize the same paper cone you used to add texture to your outline, or you can use the thumb and forefinger to manually add the materials.
In Indian culture, it is important to completely fill in your Rangoli, leaving no open spaces.

, Using a variety of colors and dimensions will enhance the artistic nature of the final design. The variety is what gives the Rangoli its wow factor.


This is where you can get really creative with your Rangoli design. Mix and match different materials until your Rangoli is full and you are pleased with the colors in your design.

, Place some candles and clay pot-lanterns around your finished Rangoli to light up your design.


If you’ve created your Rangoli on black paper, move it outside or to the desired display area. Then you can surround it with any candles or final touches.
Use chalk to write in a few wishes if you want to make your Rangoli extra special.

Break down your chosen art form into the essential components or skills.,
Practice your art every single day, making it a daily habit.,
Take an honest appraisal of your artistic weakness, to practice with mindfulness.,
Take on smaller projects, or ""studies"" to help you ramp up to your big projects.,
When in doubt, practice realism, even if it isn't your artistic form of choice.Say you love to make impressionist, brightly-colored portraits in the style of Vincent Van Gogh, or abstract, cubist paintings like Picasso.",How to Be a Good Artist1," Saying, ""I want to be a masterful painter,"" is a noble goal, but it is so broad it is hard to know where to start. Successful practice in any art form requires mastery of the smaller skills, almost all of which can be practiced independently of each other:



Painters must master drawing and sketching, color blending, shading, brush techniques, and composition.

Drawers and Illustrators need to draw, shade, color, and compose, and may want to learn the basics of digital illustration and animation.

Sculptors: Often learn a wide variety of techniques and materials, from ceramic to metal working, and must be able to sketch and draft ideas on paper. Advanced study in your material and tools of choice, including more scientific research, is highly recommended.

Video Artists: Need to be fluent across the set, from lighting, audio, camera operation, and editing. Skill drawing (for storyboards) and animating are a big plus.;
, Humans improve much faster through daily effort, and even 10 minutes a day can be better than 2 hours once a week.Find a way to make art part of your everyday routine, prioritizing it highly on your schedule. If you can't find time to make art every day, being a good artist will be exponentially harder.


Give yourself a cue each day to make things easier -- first thing in the morning, after dinner, before you exercise, etc. Coupling habits together makes them much easier to stick to.
Reward yourself slightly after each session -- maybe you don't eat dessert until done, or go for a run once the page is finished. Tie a good feeling to your daily art practice.
Missing days is okay -- it happens. Instead of beating yourself up or punishing yourself with more work the next day, just get back on track. Art should be fun, not punishment!, Not all practice sessions are equally beneficial. Every artist has areas and skills that they aren't very good at, and the best artists run to these areas in practice. Remember, this isn't always about making a publishable piece. Once you give yourself the freedom to practice things you're bad at, you'll notice yourself making much faster improvements in all areas of your art.Mindful practice is about finding mistakes and fixing them in order to improve. If you don't let yourself make mistakes, how could you ever improve.
There is a difference between ""practice"" and ""performance."" Once you realize that your sketchbooks and studies are there to help you get better, not to share with others, you can use them practice making your next ""real"" piece of art even better., A study is simply a test run of some aspect of your piece. For example, a sculptor doing a full length human body likely wouldn't launch into the replica without knowing her materials, style, and logistical concerns beforehand. To prepare, she might start studies in the following areas. Note that, though sculpture is the example, all good artists test before beginning:



Difficult or unusual sections: Hands are complex organs with many moving joints and bones. Practicing a few hands and figuring out how they will be held, is best done before adding them to the final sculpture

Logistic/Technical concerns: How is the sculpture going to stand up without falling? What base is being used, and how is the sculpture attached?

Stylistic Elements: If it is a melancholic or sad sculpture, how do you plan to capture that sadness? Smaller sculptures and sketching facial expressions will help figure it out. You could also try to replicate similar pieces or emotions., While neither of them look like anything you could ever see in real life, both men are masters of realistic portraiture. You need to know the rules before you can break them, and the ability to perfectly replicate what you see in front of you is the best technical exercise you can perform. Try out:


Sketching or drawing still landscapes
Capturing the human body realistically, both still and in motion.
Replicating your favorite paintings or works of art, teaching yourself the techniques of the masters."
"
Trust your gut when choosing projects.,
Experiment in a wide variety of styles and disciplines.,
Draw influence from your entire life, not just your artistic pursuits.,
Show your work to others for thoughts and feedback.,
Accept constructive criticism.",How to Be a Good Artist2," If an idea captures your and won't let go you've got to pursue it. Great artists don't worry if it will sell, if it fits current artistic trends, or will take a long time to make. Great artists jump into their passions with open arms, trusting themselves to make it work. If you want a unique, refreshing artistic voice, then you need to trust your voice.


It can be hard to embark on a project that feels weird, new, and experimental. But remember -- if you can't get passionate about the project, how can you expect your audience to feel passionately about it?, There is a reason burgeoning painters spend time sculpting, and vice versa. All forms of art are intrinsically linked, and they share similar vocabulary and skills (color, shading, composition, etc.). By pushing yourself to approach art differently, you open yourself up to a wealth of new influences, techniques, and styles.


Push yourself to get out of your comfort zone -- this is often where you make the biggest breakthroughs and personal discoveries.
This includes other forms of art, such as writing and music. Creative expression, whether with a paintbrush or a piccolo, is about getting your ideas out of your head and into the audiences. The medium you use to do that doesn't matter., Great artists are often great readers, using books and literature to push themselves to new ideas and philosophies. They are unashamed of their past, no matter what it is, and are confident using it for motivation and inspiration. Furthermore, great artists rarely say ""no."" They keep their minds open to everything, becoming a sponge of influences that come together to make something incredibly unique, and incredibly you.

, For most artists, art is a form of communication. You create art because you want to share it with other people. Otherwise, you could just leave the ideas in your head. Exactly how you want to show your work and to who is your choice. You could try to get your work shown in galleries and put up for sale. You could try getting published. You might be more comfortable putting your work online and possibly selling prints of it. Or maybe you would rather just frame some of your best work and hang it up in your home for your family and friends to enjoy.


Ask for honest critiques, and try to accept them with grace. You will never catch everything, and your audience's opinion will help find areas to improve in.
Ask people what they think about the art, and what it might mean. Does it match up with your own thoughts and ideas?
Did you accomplish your goals with the piece? Could you better communicate them your goals, or are you happy with ambiguity and differing opinions?

, Constructive criticism is designed to help you improve your artwork, either the piece you're working on now or your future works. A person giving constructive criticism will usually point out both the flaws and the strengths in your piece and make suggestions on how you could fix the flaws. While it isn't always fun to hear, criticism is something you're going to have to deal with as an artist. Learn to identify when a criticism of your work is valid and use that information to focus on correcting your mistakes.

Put together an online portfolio to showcase your work and talent.,
Host shows to get your work out there.,
Take classes to grow skill and make contacts.,
Devote time every day to self-promotion and social media.,
Get involved in your local art scene.,
Provide yourself a lifestyle that allows you to make daily art.",How to Be a Good Artist3," Every artist needs a portfolio -- the place where potential buyers or clients can see you work. Luckily, the internet is making it easy as website design spaces like Wix.com, SquareSpace, and Wordpress all have templates designed for artists portfolios. All you have to do is customize the name, color, and bio, then import images or videos of your art.


Purchase a custom domain name if you are looking for professional clients. A site like www.MyPortfolio.wordpress.com looks much less professional than www.MyPortfolio.com.
When done, attach this portfolio to all your social media accounts to make it easy to find.
Consider printing (or drawing/designing, for memorable flair) some business cards to get the word around., Contact small galleries near you to see if you can put some work up. Look into that restaurant or coffee shop that puts work on the walls. And, if all else fails, throw your own art show. All you need is a space to hang everything, some refreshments, and friends willing to come and support you.


Try to host shows with multiple artists when possible. That way, everyone brings their own friend groups so each artist can meet new fans.
You never know if you can display your work unless you ask. Don't be intimidated -- they absolute worst thing that happens is the word, ""no.""
Consider hosting ""open studio"" session once a month, where friends and curious spectators can watch you work and talk about your process., Few, if any, artists are so skilled that they can't benefit from some kind of formal instruction. Art classes can help you get past problems with your work that you haven't been able to solve on your own, identify areas in which you could improve, or just give you some direction and a regular time to devote to working on art. There are courses available for all skill levels at colleges, community centers, local arts centers, and numerous other places.


Your teacher and fellow students are essential contacts as you build your career. They can point to new opportunities, team up with you for shows, and support your work in the difficult early years when you're still unknown.
Never discount a connection or friend. In the word-of-mouth driven art scene, a wide, strong social network is king., It isn't always a ton of fun, but it is absolutely essential if you intend to be a professional. No one wants to champion your art but you. And, in it's own way, this is a good thing-- you no longer have to hope the ""right"" person shows up in your gallery. Instead, hard work online can get your work into many corners of the internet, and even make some money.


If you make smaller, sellable art pieces, consider a shop on Etsy or eBay.
Instagram, Tumblr, and Pinterest, with their large pictures and big art networks, are great places to share and see work.
Pick 1-2 social media accounts to run and stick with those. Trying to work on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, etc. all at once is impossible to do well without spending all day on the internet., Artist need to stick together, and many of the greats have come from collectives and groups. It is no mistake that many famous artists knew each other before striking it big, and some of the greatest moments in art (Paris in the 40's, NY in the 80's) come from shared creative communities. So go to local shows, enroll in classes, and collaborate with other artists. A rising tide carries all boats, so get out there and make some waves.


If you're struggling to find a community, look online. There are tones of forums, sites, and communities (like the famous DeviantArt) that allow you to showcase work.Pay attention to your contemporaries, supporting their own shows and work. When you are first starting out, your best network will be artists in the same situation.

, If you don't make art a daily priority, then it's going to be really hard to be a good artist. That is just the reality of practice-- all the talent in the world doesn't help if you don't sit down and make art. Honestly, this may require some sacrifices in terms of work hours, salary, and living situation. But if you want to be a professional artist, none of this should matter. You get to make art every single day!


Always remember, especially in the early yeas of practice, that all of your favorite artists went through the same process."

, Give the kids monopoly money in exchange for their chores or their help setting up the room. Then have them ""buy"" movie treats with the money they just earned. Or if they earn a weekly allowance, use this as an opportunity to have them pay you back.

, If you want to truly take the experience up a notch, find some theater-style vendors. Talk your local dollar theaters, vending machine vendors, etc. They typically have connections to get you the same products sold in theaters, not the grocery store equivalent - whether that's the right-flavored popcorn topping, or the boxed candy that you can't get elsewhere.

, Pause the movie for bathroom breaks and another trip to concessions. This is especially great for long movies like Lord of the Rings. Flicker the lights when intermission is ending.

, Hankering to buy a new release? Offset the cost by selling $1 tickets and cheap concessions to your friends/neighbors. Go the full mile and offer discounts/free tickets for people that dress in costume like at a real midnight movie release.


If this gains momentum, you could even use the earned money to buy popcorn machines or upgrade your movie equipment.

, Schedule these in advance for certain days on the calendar. Then go nuts on costumes, decorations, and treats.


Why not celebrate July 4th with a viewing of Will Smith's Independence Day where you serve up slushies (alien slime) and dots (some other alien slime)? Or you can put on a viewing of Elf during the 12 days of Christmas, matched up with hot chocolate and Snowballs, or spaghetti and syrup. For a western movie, put out a nacho/taco bar and offer bottled sarsaparilla, root beer, or apple beer.

, Stream a YouTube no cell phone advertisement before the movie, post signs for a designated lobby area, place a cellphone basket in a secure area, etc. Do whatever it takes to make your movie uninterrupted, just like a real theater experience.


If you have a bigger viewing area, consider setting up designated aisles and a cheep glow-in-the-dark marker exit sign.

, If you've gone a bit higher-end with you home system, try these ideas:


If your kids have gaming chairs, wire them up with your home theater for a more connected feel.
Most home theater systems have tools to optimize or customize the setups. Run regular system tools or move home theater speakers around the room for a closer, surround-sound feel.
Place the sub-woofer behind or under your couch/seats to increase the rumble.
For movies in your backyard, put together a cart for your projector. Create a simple setup on one base that you can wheel out to the middle of the yard. Then unroll the speakers into the yard, and voila - a 5 second surround sound experience!
Build a raised platform and put your back row of chairs on it, for stadium-style seating. Alternatively, cut legs shorter on older chairs, for the front row.

, With this option, you're not really watching the movie, because you'll be involved with props and watching for cues in the storyline. Add some sensory engagement to the experience so your audience can truly ""feel"" the movie. Throw things into your audience or powder them from above.


If it's a snowy movie, you could sprinkle potato flakes or confetti at them. For a horror movie, use plastic spiders. For a rainstorm (if you're outside), use a squirt gun!

Know that you can only add subtitles to movies on your computer.,
Find the movie you want to subtitle on your computer and put it in a separate file.,
Search online for ""Your Movie + Language + Subtitles"" to find the right file.,
Find the subtitles you want and download the .SRT file.,
Rename the subtitle file to match your movie file.,
Put the .SRT file in the folder of the movie.,
Add .SRT files to YouTube movies you are posting by clicking ""Captions"" while you upload.",How to Add Subtitles to a Movie1," If you current DVD does not have certain subtitles, found under the ""Settings"" or ""Language"" headers on the DVD menu, you will not be able to add them without advanced software and equipment. DVD's are protected and cannot be re-written, and your DVD player will not be able to add new languages. Your computer, however, is a different beast entirely, and you can add any new subtitles you can find to a movie watched on your computer.


If you're watching on a DVD players, try the ""titles"" or ""subtitle"" button on your DVD player's remote.;
, Find the folder or movie file in Finder or Windows Explorer. More likely than not it will be a .mov, .avi, or .mp4 file. Luckily, you do not need to adjust the movie file at all, however, you will need to find it and link it to a new subtitle file. Subtitle files will usually end in the extension .SRT, and are simply the words and the times that each title needs to play during the movie.


You need the movie in it's own file, with the .SRT file, for it to read the subtitles.
Some older subtitle files might end in the extension .SUB., Go on your favorite search engine and search for the subtitles in your language. If, for example, you want Indonesian subtitles for X-Men: First Class, you might search for ""X-Men: First Class Indonesian Subtitles."" The first site you find is likely good enough, as these files are small and not likely to contain viruses., Download an SRT. file from a website such as Subscene, MovieSubtitles, or YiFiSubtitles. Make sure you avoid any pop-ups and only download .SRT or .SUB files. If you feel unsafe on a site, leave and find another.

, If the movie is BestMovieEver.AVI, your subtitle needs to be written as BestMovieEver.SRT. Find you newly downloaded file wherever you put it (often in the ""Downloads"" folder) and make sure you rename appropriately. The .SRT file name must be the same name as the movie., Make a new, dedicated folder for you movie if there isn't one already. Place the .SRT file in the same folder as your movie. This will automatically link them in most video players.


The easiest video player to use is the free VLC player, which handles most file formats.

, After clicking Captions, click on ""Add a Caption Track"" and find your .SRT file. Make sure that you have ""Caption Track"" enabled and not ""Transcript Track."" Click the ""CC"" button when watching your video to enable captions.

Understand the goals of subtitling.,
Use a subtitle creation website to efficiently add subtitles to any movie file.,
Create own subtitles by hand using Notepad.,
Create subtitles in your favorite movie editor to avoid dealing with .SRT files.",How to Add Subtitles to a Movie2," Subtitles are translations, and as anyone who has ever used Google Translate can tell you, translations are as much an art form as a science. If you're subtitling the scene itself, there are several considerations you need to come up with for each line:


What is the goal of the dialog? Regardless of the words they use, what feeling is the character trying to get across? This is your guiding principle when translating.
How can you fit the subtitled words within the time the character is speaking? Some writers will display a few lines of dialogue at once, starting a little early and ending late to give viewers a chance to read everything.
How do you handle slang and figures of speech? They often do not translate well, so you'll have to substitute slang or figurative language from your native language. This, however, requires you to look up the meaning of foreign expressions and slang., Sites like DotSub, Amara, and Universal Subtitler let you see the movie while you write out the subtitles, eventually spitting out an .SRT file that fits with your movie. While all subtitling sites work differently, they all follow a similar format:


Choose when the title starts.
Write the title out.
Choose when the title disappears.
Repeat across the movie, marking ""Complete"" when finished.
Download the .SRT file and place it in the same folder as your movie., You can write out subtitles by hand if you want though the process is greatly expedited by a program. To do so, open up a Text editor like Window's Notepad or Apple's TextEdit (both free and pre-installed), and make sure you know the proper format for a subtitle. Before beginning, click ""Save As"" and title it after ""YourMovie.SRT."" Then set the encoding to ""ANSI"" for English subtitles and ""UTF-8"" for Non-English.Then write out your titles. Each of the following parts goes on its own line, so hit ""enter"" after each one:



The number of a subtitle. 1 would be the first title, 2 the second, etc.

The duration of the subtitle. This is written in the format hours:minutes:seconds:milliseconds --> hours:minutes:seconds:milliseconds

Example: 00:01:20:003 --> 00:01:27:592




The text of the subtitle: This is simply what the title will say.

A blank line. Leave one blank line before the number of the next title., This method lets you see the titles as you add them and adjust their placement, color, and style by hand. Open your movie file in your favorite film editor, such as Premier, iMovie, or Windows Movie Maker, and pull the film into your timeline (the work section). From here, click on your programs ""Titles"" menu and choose a style you like. Write out your title, drag it on top of the appropriate section of the film, and repeat.


You can right-click on a title and copy and paste it to keep your same settings on every title, saving you tons of time.
The only drawback to this format is that the movie will need to be saved as a separate file. You will not be able to turn the titles off, as they will now be part of the movie.

Leave when you see them getting tired.",How to Enjoy a Museum," There are museums for art, information, history, military and war, transportation, science, animals, theater, and more. Make a list of subjects that interest you or that you enjoyed when you were in school. Then look up where to find a museum about that subject in a city near you. Picking a museum that covers that topic will naturally get you excited about the visit.


For example, if you love to draw, visit an art museum. If airplanes fascinate you, visit an Air Force museum.
If you’re making a trip as a family or with friends, and everyone likes different things, you’ll need to compromise. Find a large museum that covers a variety of subjects. The Field Museum in Chicago has permanent exhibits about science, animals, and dinosaurs in addition to their temporary exhibits about various world cultures.;
, Most museums now have online portals which allow you to explore the museum virtually. When looking up your chosen museum, find out what special exhibits are currently there and what activities (talks, displays, or tours) will be happening on the day you visit., Note what time the museum opens and closes. It will typically be less crowded at the beginning and end of the day, but if you wait to go until right before closing, you risk feeling rushed and not seeing everything you wanted to.Also note whether the museum is closed on national holidays or certain days of the week.

, There will usually be prices posted on their website for adults and children, so calculate how much entry will cost you. If a museum doesn’t accept credit cards, it will likely state that on the site, so read carefully to see if you need to bring cash.

Look for any information regarding free days or discount days. Some museums occasionally offer free or discounted entry on a certain weekday or during a slow period to try to attract more visitors. This may be worth adjusting your visit date for if you want to save money.Also look into fees for storage. The museum may charge to check your coat or bag, and they may demand you check your bag if it’s over a certain size. Find out what this size is (typically a backpack or larger) so you can bring a smaller bag to keep on you during your visit., In major cities, driving to a museum means steep parking fees. Try to take public transportation like trains or buses if possible. Limit the amount of walking you do ahead of time since you’ll be walking a lot at the museum., Do not attempt to see everything unless it’s a very small museum with just a few rooms. You’ll easily become overwhelmed both physically and mentally. Make a list of the things you’d like to see and prioritize what’s most meaningful to you.For example, if you're visiting the Louvre in Paris, is the Mona Lisa a must-see for you? If so, make that number one on the list, and then add a few more things you simply can't leave without seeing. After that, write down some things that you'd like to see but wouldn't devastate you if you missed them.
Visit the museum’s website to see what’s new or what’s most popular. Or ask friends and family who’ve been there before what they recommend checking out.
Pick 1-2 exhibits that interest you, or about 20 pieces of art, sculptures, or other items of interest to look at in depth., Beyond that, you risk becoming tired and losing track of the things you’ve enjoyed most about the museum. If you have children with you, you may need to make it even shorter than this. Planning your visits on free or discounted days can help you feel like you’re not wasting money by staying so briefly., Eat a sizeable meal before you arrive so that you’re not distracted by hunger. And dress in comfortable clothing, especially when it comes to shoes. Wear something with good arch support or insoles since you’ll be on your feet for most of the museum visit., Most museums have a plaque or sign associated with every single item on display. But you likely won’t have time to read them all (and you probably won’t want to). Stick to reading the information associated with the items you’ve prioritized, and then if you have extra time, you can read about other attractions that have caught your eye., When you purchase entry tickets, ask if they offer pre-recorded audio tours. Many museums offer these electronic devices that you can carry with you for a small rental fee. This can help you get an in-depth lesson on what you’re looking at without needing to read every little plaque on the wall., Some museums offer free tours that start at the same time every day. Usually you can just show up at the meeting place and join the group without any sort of fee or registration, but not always. Check the museum’s website or ask an employee when you arrive when and where a tour is gathering and whether there’s a fee., Open a dialogue with a friend or family member who’s accompanying you. Ask them which painting or fossil was their favorite and why. Discuss something you learned that surprised you. This is a good way to connect with your companions as well as get a better sense of the exhibit you saw., If there are benches or chairs offered for museum patrons to use, take advantage of them. Sit for a few minutes whenever you feel yourself getting fatigued. If there’s a museum cafeteria, grab a drink and sit and chat with your friends or family for a little while before continuing.

, Many museums have dedicated kids' sections, but some, like small niche museums, probably won't have much to entertain them. Look for dedicated children's museums, aquariums, science museums, and planetariums. Avoid military and war museums unless your child is old enough to understand the complexities of this information., Explain to them some of the basic rules about museums: no yelling, no touching, no running, etc. Tell them you understand the no touching rule is hard, but if all the millions of visitors got to touch a painting, it would probably get destroyed. Get them excited about any interactive exhibits where they do get to touch, such as a display at an aquarium where they can pet a live starfish., Go online and point out certain works of art or fossils that they’ll be seeing during their visit. Then make a checklist or even a treasure map so that they can be on the hunt for those objects., Encourage them to draw pictures of what they see. If you’re at an art museum, have a drawing contest to see who can do the best reproduction of one of the paintings. Or have them draw or write down how an exhibit makes them feel., You can spend some time showing artwork or antique artillery to your kids, but what they’re really going to enjoy are features that they can participate in. Spend a good portion of the visit in areas where they can touch, feel, climb, get wet, and explore. Use this as a reward for all the “no touching” that they have to respect elsewhere in the museum., Most museums probably won’t allow you to eat inside the exhibits, but if your child gets hungry, they won’t be able to focus on anything else. Pack a granola bar, fruit snacks, or a banana and have them eat it in the lobby or in a hallway between exhibits where you’re unlikely to get in trouble for bringing in your own food.

Consider limiting your museum visits to those that are kid-friendly and allow outside food and drink. This information can often be found on an FAQ page of the museum’s website.If budget isn’t a concern, visit the museum cafeteria to buy a snack and drink for your child.

, As a parent or caregiver, you have to recognize when enough is enough. Even if you want to stay longer, if you see your children getting tired, begin to wrap up the visit. Letting it go on too long could result in a tantrum, and then no one will enjoy the museum visit. As they get older, their stamina will increase, so just see this as training."

Have fun with this.",How to Find Mistakes in Movies," Older films are usually filled with bloopers and mistakes, so selecting an older movie may prove to be fruitful and is definitely good practice because you can check your powers of observation against lists people have made for older movies online. Looking for bloopers while watching a film in a theater is probably not the best place while you're a novice, although if you're really detailed minded and analytical, you may find that you find mistakes innately. As you find you're better at spotting the errors, move on to newer movies.;
, Be sure to notice everything and don't be surprised if you have to play a scene again to confirm a suspected blooper.

, Whether it's someone calling a character by the actor's real name, a door sitting ajar in one scene, but closed in the next or a microphone falling or dipping into the screen, there's bound to be a mistake somewhere in the film. Be observant and be aware the more rewarding mistakes are often harder to find. The types of mistakes to look for include:


A lack of consistency and/or plot holes. Bad timelines, omissions that are needed to establish whereabouts or current events, forgetfulness about a character's background, things happening without reason, etc., are a common film error but most people don't think too hard about them. However, once you focus on them, this can really throw the film's credibility for you! A lack of consistency can apply to a person's age, character (unless intentional), and historical aspects of the situation.
Continuity problems. These are a big part of movie mistakes, found both within and between scenes. They may indicate scene cuts, fierce editing, or just a lack of noticing by anyone. For example, a spilled item may have mysteriously moved to somewhere else during a movie, or disappearing and reappearing parts of costumes and changes in position of characters occur. Other lacks of continuity can include makeup that hasn't been applied accurately to represent an injury, scar, particular feature of a character etc., height changes, scenery stuff-ups, doors opening the opposite way, glasses refilling, cigarettes suddenly alight again, etc.
Slip-ups: These are outright errors, like real hair showing from under the wig, clothes not getting dirtied by falling into mud, etc., using the actor's real name and not the character's, an object actually hits a person or bounces in the wrong direction when it isn't meant to, a prop is shorter or taller than it is supposed to be, a personal item of jewelry or a watch can be seen when it doesn't belong (also anachronistic, see below), car number plates that belong to the wrong state or even country, etc. (and changing ones on supposedly the same car, also continuity), and so forth. For the grammatically inclined, look at written parts of the film to spot spelling and grammatical errors; they do happen!

Anachronisms. These are things that simply couldn't have existed at the time the story is set. To spot these, you're might have to be either a very good history buff or very knowledgeable about the topic in question but basically you're looking for things that couldn't have existed at the time the movie was said to be set in. Look for objects, dates, names of companies/countries/products, etc., that didn't exist in the time the move is set. For example, in Titanic, Jack tells Rose that he went ice fishing in a lake that was man-made 6 years after the Titanic sank!Specific errors relating to a profession or trade. There are many errors of a specific subject-matter nature that you can spot if you're knowledgeable of the area. For example, there are many online lists of science, technology, medical, aircraft, and legal errors in films (and many other subjects). Whatever your profession, training, or background, it's likely you can spot things that would never been done at your place of work, hobby, or research! For example, most movie scenes featuring medical elements show CPR being performed too slowly, with an incorrect ratio between chest compression and ventilation, using a defibrillator when it is not going to work, and declaring the patient dead before reanimation would be given up as no good in real life.""As if"" moments. These aren't so much mistakes or bloopers as unrealistic character actions or assumptions. They can be fun if you're a good student of human nature. These link back to inconsistencies or plot holes.

, This will prove a lot easier if you have a video or DVD player, as it's likely you'll want to go back over the scene in question to double and triple check you're not missing anything.


If you're a screenwriter, director, or film editor, lists of mistakes and bloopers are something you should avidly read and learn from! There is a wealth of material you can learn from and it will all point to good research, being very careful, and concentrating on the small details.

, You may find that you've watched the whole movie and found no mistakes, so you can either move along to the next film or replay your current one.

, These sites have communities of people who place the mistakes they've found online to be read by all. Some are free, but others may require registration fees. And it's probably a good idea to check that your error spotting hasn't already been noted; if so, perhaps just join in with noting you've spotted the errors too!

, Spotting errors in movies is not supposed to be a perfectionist's opportunity to gloat; pride comes before a fall. Errors happen in all things, and movies aren't immune. Many people spend hours trying to ensure that the movie is good as a whole and too much analysis of the errors will ruin your enjoyment of the movie. Instead, treat movie error-spotting as a fun game to indulge in now and then, something for a good laugh, but not a reason to stop enjoying your movie-going experiences.

Introduction to Film Criticism
History through Film
Introduction to Filmmaking, Filmmakers use both static shots and dynamic shots. Static shots are camera shots where the camera remains stationary and does not alter its aim. Dynamic shots are shots where the camera is moving and changing its aim. Filmmakers use both types of shots to convey meaning and to emphasize elements of what they are filming.

With both types of shots, the angle, point of view, and scale may vary. Pay attention to these different elements when watching different films., Lighting is one of the most important parts of how filmmakers bring their stories to life. Filmmakers can use lighting to emphasize elements of what they’re shooting or to add mood to the story. There are several major types of lighting:

Back lighting. This is when lighting comes from behind the character or object. This can be used to make something look mysterious or ominous.
Key and fill lighting. This is lighting that is directed at a character or object.
Under-lighting. This comes from below the character or object.
Top lighting. This is where the lighting comes from above. It can be used to create a brighter, happier scene.
Side lighting. This is when lighting is directed at the object from the side., The sound of a film can alter your perception of visuals and visual affects tremendously. As a result, your pursuit of film appreciation should be paired with a study of how filmmakers integrate sound into their work. Some things to consider are:


The score
Sound effects
Lack of sound, Formalist film is when a filmmaker focuses on aesthetics – how things look – more than the content or subject matter. Formalist filmmakers will experiment with a wide variety of things, including lighting, special effects, editing, colors, hues, and more.Some formalist films include: ‘Trip to the Moon’, ‘Cabinet of Dr. Caligari’, ‘The Blue Angel’, or ‘Golddiggers of 1933’

, Realist film is when a filmmaker tries to recreate reality. Realist films will focus on set, location, and details. Realism does not lend itself to distortion or creative camera work. Realist films will often have a candid or natural appearance.Some realist films include: ‘Arrival of a Train’, ‘The Bicycle Thief’, ‘Breaking the Waves’, or the ‘Blair Witch Project’.

, People on film crews sometimes have varied backgrounds, such as in writing, theatre, or art. Consider taking classes in these subjects to broaden your knowledge and prepare you for becoming a filmmaker.

, You should watch a variety of movies to get ideas and tips for your own film. Choose movies from different genres and different eras. Pay attention to details such as:What do you like about a film?
What makes a movie believable?
What makes a strong character?
How are props used successfully?
How does the location impact or enhance the film?

, It is important to keep your knowledge current regarding the market. Find out news and trends about the film industry so that you know what you’re up against., Meeting other people in the industry can help you out tremendously. Follow leaders in the filmmaking biz on social media, and attend filmmaking and movie events as often as you can., Speak to someone who has experience with filmmaking.

Ask to tag along when they shoot one of their own movies so you can see firsthand what works and what doesn’t.You may be able to find a mentor in film school. Ask a classmate who has experience or one of your professors to mentor you. Alternatively, once you gain experience on a film crew, you may be able to find a mentor through your work.

, In order to gain experience in the industry, you should work on a film crew. Search online for job openings near you, and ask your classmates and professors if they know of any crews seeking help.

, The producer can help choose other members for the film crew as well as cast the roles for the movie. This person manages the production from start to finish. They are the group leader and the one who develops the project. You will likely need education as well as experience to qualify for a producer role, but as a beginner you can likely be a production assistant., The director is responsible for overseeing the the shooting and assembly of the film. They work closely with all the other members of the team to ensure everyone is on track., This team writes the script for the film.

, Actors star in the film, so you should have acting experience for this job. It is important that actors are able to become the person they are portraying, no matter how different the character is from the actor's personality., Technical producers work hard after the filming is completed. They are in charge of choosing which shots to use, editing the film for content, as well as adding special effects and music when necessary., At the very least, you will need a camera. Don’t worry about purchasing one that is top of the line, but instead choose something of good quality at an affordable price. You’ll have plenty of time to upgrade in the future.


If your camera doesn’t have a good microphone, you may also want to purchase boom mics so that the actors’ voices come through loud and clear.

, Choose an idea for your first film based on something you are both passionate and knowledgeable about. Get inspiration from the real world, even if your film will be sci-fi or fantasy. The audience should still be able to relate to the issues and connect to the characters.


Focus on content. What’s in your film is more important than the equipment you shoot your film with. Remember to keep your focus on the content of the film and create a story that other people want to see and can identify with., Making a film takes an entire crew to keep things running smoothly. Select people to fill the roles that you cannot, such as producer, director, scriptwriter, camera operator, gaffer, boom operator, costume coordinator, art director, technical producer, and actors.


If you’ve taken film classes, see if any of your classmates are interested in joining your film crew. You can also post notices at school or online to find people willing to become part of the crew.

, Pick a nice day when your crew can arrive at the set location. Spend time working with your actors to ensure they deliver their lines correctly and show appropriate emotion.Take your time; your film will be stronger if you aren’t rushing. You may need to film a scene several times to get it right.

, Go through each scene to find the best shots. Add music and sound effects to the film. Pay close attention to the details to ensure the film is the best it can be. Make sure transitions are seamless and that there are no errors in your film, such as an actor drinking lemonade for part of one scene and Kool-Aid for another part of the same scene.

, This is the most important step because if you do not have fun, it will come across in your film. Laugh at your bloopers, and take breaks if you need them. Remember why you are filming in the first place: you love making movies. Do it for the fun, not the fame.

, Distribute your film in every way you can. Post it online, to your social media accounts, YouTube, and Vimeo. You should also try to show your film to people in person. Sign up for screening contests or set up a showing of your film in your hometown.

Learn the different jobs related to camera work.,
Take film and cinematography classes.,
Practice filming.,
Always be learning.,
Watch movies.",How to Become a Cinematographer1," If you want to be successful in the film industry, no matter what position you want, you need to know exactly where your job ends and where someone else’s begins. Learn what the roles of a cinematographer are. There are many different job functions behind the camera. As a cinematographer, your job is to be in charge of the actual shooting of the film. Shot by shot.
The cinematographer is also often referred to as the director of photography (DP). You’re in charge of how the camera moves. How the lighting is set up. What angles are used, and more.
Your job is not to direct actors, get in the way of camera operators who are not you, tell the sound department how to set up sound, etc.
If you want to be successful as a cinematographer, you’ll need to learn the ins and outs of filming and where you belong.;
, In the film business, a fancy diploma isn’t always needed. But learning from professionals is the best way to get your foot in the door and learn invaluable skills.


Getting a proper education in film and cinematography will give you the tools and training to become successful. You will get to watch amazing films and shots and learn the techniques and terminology behind each move and element.
Taking classes will also give you the knowledge on what your job is and what the different tools you will need are. You will learn how to identify what different cameras and lenses to use. How to get difficult shots. When to use a steady cam versus a camera on a dolly.
Going to school for film is also rewarding. You will not only get to learn from professionals, but you will get to be graded on your work. You will learn when you aren’t doing something right and how to improve.
Schools also often have nice equipment that you otherwise wouldn’t have access to. You will get to make projects, build a portfolio, and network. You never when your professor might want to use you. Or your classmate who is now in Hollywood working on big budget films.

, In addition to going to school for film and working within an academic structure, you will also need to branch out on your own. School is invaluable. You will learn proper techniques and methods there. But practicing on your own will let you discover your own style.


Get a camera and start filming on your own. Take what you’ve learned from school and apply it to your outside work. Take what you like and what resonated with you. Learn to ignore what you don’t like.
The reason that filming outside of an institution will help you is because at school you will often be told there is a best way to shoot something. And in an academic sense, there is. But you should remember that you are an individual, and a storyteller. Your voice is through the lens of your camera and you should learn to speak it.

, Even if you’ve gone to film school for cinematography. A large part of your job is to always continue your education. The film industry is rapidly evolving and you need to not only keep up but stay ahead of it.


There are so many aspects to filming, and as the cinematographer, you’ll need to know most of those aspects better than anyone else on set.
Read forums, books, and articles on the subject. Stay up to date with new technology and filming techniques. Learn what cameras and lenses are good for certain lighting and shots and moods. New cameras are constantly coming out and changing how we think about film. Or, rather digital film.
You will be valued by your work. But also by your knowledge of your craft. If you’re the person who people come to with a camera or lighting question, you’re in a good place. You want to be the person that people know to come to with any questions. Whether it’s “What’s the newest camera out right now?” or “In that movie we just watched, how did the director get that awesome shot?”
Learn as much as you can. Magazines like the American Cinematographer Magazine and the American Society of Cinematographers are a great resource. You can stay up to date on news. Read and learn about iconic shots. And learn how J.J. Abrams and his cinematographer were able to do so many live actions in the latest Star Wars movie. , It almost sounds like an excuse to relax and watch your favorite movie. Except that to become a great cinematographer, you’ll have to watch movies differently than your average viewer.


Learn to look at films through the eye of the lens, not the eye of a viewer. Take notes whether on paper or mental. Watch for different shots, what makes these shots special or needed?
Your job is to be able to see a blank space and envision how you can tell a compelling story within a frame. Take notes on how the camera moves. How the lighting casts shadows to convey mood. How close the shot is to an actor and where on the actor the lens is. When and why the camera moves.
Watching movies with this kind of critical eye will help you to adjust your way of thinking about, and seeing film. You’ll be able to understand why a camera moves when it does and why it shows what it shows.

Start shooting.,
Take notes everywhere you go and storyboard shots of your surroundings.,
Make your own short films.,
Get on a set.",How to Become a Cinematographer2," You’ve probably already practiced filming on your own. Whether you’re in school or learning by yourself. But just like a sport or a muscle, you have to practice and exercise.


Invest in a camera and some equipment. Your smartphone isn’t the worst camera option you have anymore. Provided you have a relatively new smartphone. But it still won’t compare to even a DSLR camera. If you can, invest in a DSLR camera.
DSLR’s made in the last few years can usually shoot HD video. Additionally, these are cameras that are great for photography. And since you are a cinematographer, photography is one of your best friends.
Learning photography will be invaluable to you if you want to be successful as a cinematographer. You will learn framing, composition, exposure, texture, etc. All these elements that are crucial to getting a great photo also apply to getting a great shot. , Then film those shots. This will be really easy if you have a nice DSLR with you.


When you’re out and about during your day, take moments to look at a nearby landscape or city street. See how it looks to you. Imagine you are filming this location for a movie.
Take some photos of the area you are studying. Take notes on how it makes you feel, what’s happening in that moment. Maybe you’re on a busy street in a city right before it rains. Or you took the long way home and are standing by a field of tall grass as the sun sets. What emotions do these images conjure up in you? What kinds of scenes could be taking place here?
These are questions you should learn to ask yourself and answer at any given moment. Jot down the answers into a notebook and write the time and place. Snap a couple of photos or film a few seconds.

, If you want to be the director of photography, you need to learn to direct, both your camera and people.


Come up with an idea for a short film and make it. You can choose to take on all the roles or stick to a few. Get your friends to help you. This will be pretty easy if you are or were in film school. Just get out there and start making short movies. Try for three, or five, or ten minute films to start.
You don’t need to make the great indie masterpiece. The fact is, you probably won’t, at least not for a while. So don’t worry about getting everything right and perfect. Use what you have at your disposal and get out there. Actually shooting something will put you ahead of most of the people who dream of becoming a cinematographer but never take advantage of that dream.
You need to learn how to tell a story with your camera. The best way for you to do that is by trial and error. Yes, schooling and tutoring and studying will help you. But to really develop your talents, you’ll have to fail and make some mistakes before you realize how to best get what you want and need in your own way.

, Once you have a little bit of practice and work to show, it’s going to be time to get yourself on a professional set.


Have realistic expectations for getting on a set. No one is going to pull you out of the blue and hand you a camera. You’ll have to slowly work your way up. It doesn’t matter how you get on set. You may not even be able to get a job related to the camera work.
Apply for any set jobs that you are qualified for. You can be a production assistant, camera operator, lighting technician, craft service personnel, or even an extra. Your goal isn’t to get a shortcut to fame. It’s to get exposure and learn how a real professional set operates.
Get on set and take everything in. It will be eye opening. You will not only see how the filming happens but how people act and behave. You will come across extras who think this job is going to bring fame. Production assistants who are annoyed by the extras. Directors who act like tyrants. Camera operators who are quick and easily annoyed if anyone gets too close to any equipment.
Build relationships with gaffers, grips, production managers, producers, and directors.
If you get on set, let everything you experience soak in. Then stay out of the way until you’re needed. While there will be a lot happening, it will also give you the opportunity to see the magic happen. Pay attention to how the lighting is set up. How the crew moves props and materials around to get a tough shot. What lenses are used and why certain ones are used for certain shots. Learn from what people do right, and what people do wrong.

Join online groups.,
Build a reel of your best work.,
Make a website.,
Promote your films.,
Email contacts, professors, and anyone one else you’ve worked with.,
Get experience anywhere and anyway you can.",How to Become a Cinematographer3," Join social media groups to help you find resources and networking opportunities.


There are plenty of sites that can help you find jobs. Sign up and fill out your profile. The start searching and applying. Sites like Production Beast is an online resource for connecting people in the film industry. Likewise, Facebook has tons of film oriented groups which you can join to discuss, connect, and find work. Search for cinematography and filming groups in Facebook and ask to join any groups that stand out to you. Ask your friends for recommendations on any good groups.

, Once you’ve done some work of your own you’ll need to build a reel. Every position in the industry will require a different kind of reel to showcase. And within those different kinds of reels will be several methods for creating one.
For director of photography reels, there are a few things to note. Your reel should showcase your absolute best work. If it doesn’t look great and someone sees it, the viewer will think that this is the most you’re capable of.
Whether you take on other roles in your work isn’t important right now. Even if you’ve directed or edited, this reel is for cinematography. Only include work that showcases your talent as a cinematographer.
People want to see your talent in camera movement, lighting, composition, visual creativity, versatility, and, at least, one great moment.
That’s a lot to pack into no more than two minutes. You don’t have to get all those aspects in, especially in one clip. But you should try and show as much of those elements as possible. Your reel should be no longer than two minutes. And if you don’t have enough quality footage to even make it that long, then keep it shorter. Two great clips that culminate in forty-five seconds will serve you much better than two minutes of mediocre work.

, You’ve done a lot of work so far to become the amazing cinematographer you are. You’ve studied, you’ve shot your own projects, you’ve worked on sets, and you have photos and a reel to show off. Why not put it all on your own website.


These days, it’s not enough to just have a headshot, business card, resume, and a nice smile. With websites being extremely easy to make whether you can code or not, more and more industry people have one and expect you to as well.
Go to Squarespace, Wix, Cargocollective, or even Tumblr and make a site for yourself. You should pay for hosting and a customized domain name. The address to your site should be your name.
The reason you should pay to have your customized domain and other premium features is so that others can see you’re serious. If your site is clearly a stock template with no customization and your address is “‘Username’.tumblr.com,” someone might see it and not take you seriously. Put the same effort into your networking tools as you do your art.
Your website, especially as a cinematographer, should be beautiful and tell a story. You don’t have to make it super complicated. It should be simple and plainly showcase your work. But, it should in a way be a work of art in itself.

, Promote the films you’ve made or have been a part of. Upload these films online and host screenings.


Put your films up on your website, or, at least, trailers for the films. And upload the films to YouTube or Vimeo. Share links on your social pages. Host screenings and create events you can invite people to.
Submit your work for film festivals. Being a cinematographer isn’t an easy job, and getting noticed is harder. So why not do everything you can to get your name out there? Festivals are a great way to get exposure and network with other professionals and artists.

, Stay in contact with industry people you’ve met.


If you get someone’s contact information, store it somewhere you will remember. Get your own business cards to exchange and hand out. Business cards may seem old fashioned. But when someone hands you a business card and you have nothing to hand back, it sends a message and can feel weird.
Reach out to contacts. After you’ve met someone send an email or message and remind this person where you met and who you are. Explain that it was a pleasure to meet and that you'd love to work together or get advice.
Don’t be afraid to ask people for advice, invite people to screenings, and ask for feedback. You won’t always get it. But you never know when someone will help you out.
After you’ve had some experience, you can email contacts and professors and politely ask for any leads on potential jobs. Everyone in this industry is always looking for work. And people are often willing to help others out. You never know when someone will come to you for a job or advice. Or when someone who has had success will remember how great you were to work with and call you.

, Becoming a cinematographer is hard work and will take time to gain some traction and a reputation. That’s why, especially in the beginning, you should get experience however you can.


Ask your friends, colleagues, teachers, etc., for any help on getting work. Don’t expect to always get work in exactly the position you want. Take anything that gives you experience.
Continue learning and shooting things yourself. You should always be creating new work as your talent grows. Update your resume and reel frequently so that you are always ready to put your best self forward.
Experience comes in many forms. Whether it’s simply taking photos for practice, working on a set, or acting as the director of photography on a film.
Don’t get discouraged if you feel like you’re not getting the work or exposure you want. There are plenty of ways to create your own content. And in the film industry, you will go through cycles where you may be in high demand for a few months. Then the next several months are quiet. Learn to accept this flow and take down time to relax.

Enjoy your awesome job.",How to Be a Film Director," You have probably seen lots of films if you are interested in becoming a film director, but you can start to use your film viewing experiences as a way to learn about film making. Watch as many films as you can and pay attention to the details.


Try to count at least 15 mistakes in each film you watch. Look for acting errors, editing errors, storyline continuity errors, etc.
Develop your awareness of storytelling as you watch films. Try watching movies with the sound off and pay attention to how the story unfolds through images as well. Or, you can also listen to the dialogue, soundtrack, and other sounds in a film to see how the story unfolds through what characters say.;
, To become a director, it is important to get started right away and use any means necessary to make your own films. Get a camera if you don't already have one. Although a quality camera will help you to produce better quality films, start with any camera you can find.



Write your own screenplay or work with a friend who writes.
Get a group of friends together on the weekend and shoot scenes for a short film. Over time, you can edit the scenes together using a program like Adobe Premier.
Making short films will force you to start learning the technical aspects of directing. You'll need to know how to edit, write, and do everything else, too. Making your own short films will give you a chance to wear multiple hats and develop different skill sets.

, The best way to learn to direct actors is by getting experience acting, whether this is by acting in your own films or being part of a drama group. Learning more about acting and doing some acting yourself will give you a greater appreciation for the actors that you are working with and it may make it easier to communicate with them.Try to learn the lingo of actors. For example, you can learn about different acting strategies or techniques, such as classical acting and method acting.

, While you will probably start out writing your own scripts, you may need to work with other people’s scripts later on. Reading scripts that other people have written is a good way to practice bringing someone else’s story to life. When you read other people’s scripts, try to think about the details of how you would shoot each scene.For example, if two people are having an argument in a scene, how would you position them? What camera angles would you use? What kind of lighting would you use? What sounds would be in the background?

, Though it's totally not required, film school is great for three things: forced experience, access to crews, and networking. Plenty have made it who did not go to film school, but plenty more have made it who have. You'll have access to internships, workshops, and, most importantly, names, names, names. If you have a project, you can get a crew handed to you and you can network by helping others out, too.


Although highly competitive, NYU, USC, University of California at Los Angeles, AFI (Los Angeles), and California Institute of the Arts are some of the top schools. Several well-known directors have attended these schools, such as Spike Lee, Martin Scorsese, Oliver Stone, Ron Howard, George Lucas, John Singleton, Amy Heckerling, David Lynch, Terrence Malick, Francis Ford Coppola, and John Lasseter., Becoming a film director doesn't happen overnight. Most directors started out working as runners, camera operators, or performing other roles as part of a production crew. No job is too small. Whether it's filing paperwork, making sure the actors have their bagels, or watching over the camera equipment at night, it's a step in the right direction.


If you're in film school, look into internships. If you're not, check your local Craigslist, get in the know with the creative types in your area, and offer to be of service. If you're amicable and trustworthy, people will want to work with you again. And the gigs will get bigger and better each time.
A production company is more likely to give a chance to someone with five years of production assistant experience over some kid fresh out of film school. Try to find a production assistant job or another entry level production crew job and do your best.

, Long story short, you won't become a director without a reel. That is the most important thing to have. That being said, this is definitely an industry where it's a lot easier to show said reel if you have an in. To get an in, you need to start networking right away. The more people you know, the more opportunities you will have.


Attend industry events, such as mixers, conventions, parties, premiers, etc. Introduce yourself to people and try to develop good relationships with the people you meet. Offer to help out on future projects or invite others to work with you.

, On your path to become a film director, you will need to develop your resume with other types of directing jobs, like directing music videos, TV shows, and commercials. The paychecks you receive for these jobs won't be in the millions, but these jobs will help to fill out your resume with directing experience.


Some of these gigs will pay well and you may even enjoy the work, so don’t turn down a directing job just because it is for a commercial and not a feature length film.

, Making short films with friends you have made in the industry is the quickest way to bulk up your reel. Work with the friends you've made, and with others who are also trying to break into the industry. Sometimes the budget will come out of your own pocket, sometimes it won't, but it's a necessary step on the ladder to success.

, If you have a film you're particularly proud of, then you can enter it into a film festival. The great part about it is that you can enter a film festival anywhere. There are probably some film festivals in your state or region that you can participate in.


Sundance receives 12,000 submissions per year, so it is competitive. You may want to start smaller and work your way up.Just make sure you meet the deadline and formatting requirements!Quentin Tarantino's ""Reservoir Dogs"" was discovered at Sundance Film Festival and Steven Spielberg stumbled upon a then unheard of film called ""Paranormal Activity"" at a film festival.

, Your reel, or portfolio, is what you'll be submitting to any project that's looking for a director, so it is important to make sure that it is impressive.Models submit their modeling portfolios, actors submit their headshots and resumes, and directors submit their reels. Your reel should include information about your education, professional experience, and films. Here's what you'll need:


Information on your educational experience
An accompanying resume showing your experience to date
Your contact information
Clips that also show your skills in editing, writing, animation and cinematography
A list of film festivals participated in and awards won
Miscellaneous experience -- music videos, commercials, animated shorts, TV shows, etc.
Stills and storyboards showing your process

, Even after you become a director, you're not necessarily on the top of the totem pole. You'll have to work with lots of different people and sometimes people will clash with each other or with you. As the director, keeping everyone happy will often be your responsibility.Start working on your people skills early on so that you will be well-equipped to handle different problems and personalities later on.


Keep in mind that you may have to deal with some really frustrating situations. Imagine that your producer calls you and tells you he doesn't like the scene you filmed at 5 AM in the middle of Nowhere, Kansas to get the exact perfect shot at the golden hour. The actress changed a few of her lines to give her character more depth and the money's gone. You'll spend the entire night reworking the script to make room for something that can be filmed tomorrow at the studio.

, Once you have a decent reel, an agent may want to represent you. An agent can negotiate your contracts for you and help you to decide you what is and what is not in your best interest. However, you should never pay money up front to acquire an agent. An agent should only charge you if you make money as a result of his or her efforts.


A large part of an agent’s job will be to negotiate your ""gross points."" This is a fancy term for however much money the movie makes, you get X percent of it. When a movie makes $100, it's not that big of a deal. But imagine if your next movie rakes in $1 billion! Those gross points matter and they matter big time.

, Get ready to take none of the credit and all of the blame. When a movie does well, it's rare that the director gets seen as the reason why. But when a movie does poorly, it's always that the director gets blamed. If it's a flop, you'll be hard-pressed to get another parallel gig anytime soon. Even if a movie that you direct is successful, you may not get as much recognition as the actors in your film.


Maybe not for you, but for the average Joe on the street, directors aren't seen as the amazing film visionaries they are. It's the actors that make the movie. So when it comes to the public, you'll go unappreciated. And when it comes to your crew, it's no different. If your movie is bad, your producers will blame you. If the actor is upset about how their hair looks, they'll blame you. It's a cycle you'll, best case scenario, grow to tolerate.

, After you have had a few directing jobs, you can become a part of the Director's Guild of America (DAG) (provided you're US based, of course). By becoming a member of DAG, you're guaranteed a $160,000 salary for 10 weeks.


In most cases, you must be hired by a signatory company to be eligible. Or you make it big out of nowhere.The initial fee is a few thousand dollars and you pay minimal dues beyond that. It's completely worth it, especially if the projects are not constant.

, After you achieve your goal, make sure that you enjoy and appreciate your job. It will be stressful sometimes, but it should also be quite satisfying. You will always be doing something different depending on the stage of the film that you are working on.


In pre-production, you're translating the script into a movie. Something visual. You're figuring out all the logistics, the casting, and the real nuts and bolts of it all. This is arguably the most important.In production, you'll be doing what everyone pictures directors do. You'll let the actors know what you see for them and how you want the scene to play out. However, you'll also be on a massive time crunch to paint a masterpiece. It will be chaotic, but also thrilling.
In post-production, you'll sit down with editing team and piece it all together. Make sure that you develop good relationships with your editors to ensure that you are on the same page. In post-production, you'll also figure out the music and all the other finer points to draw it all together.

Make your personality pop: Characters in a movie are so important because of who they are in the plot, so make sure to make your personality a big thing and don't let it be something that is a part of you, make it who you are!,
Have charisma: You can't make it big with your personality without charisma, so try being a better version of yourself if you want to act like a character, not an extra.

,
Make sure to sometimes be the main character, not the main character's something: Every character has a key-scene, which is an important scene for the character or the plot in general, so it's okay to have something being about you.,

, You'll need some will to do this, but it becomes simple like breathing after a while. Bigger movements in general and intense gestures are what characters use to express their emotions in a scene. So, try copying their mannerisms when they receive big or sad news and you'll take your day to a whole new theatrical level. It's fun!

, Make dramatic stares and bring intensity to your eyeballs' moves.

, Apply that to your everyday routine and everyone will start paying attention to whatever you say.

, And it's not only the wardrobe, hair and makeup (for girls, obviously) count too!

Don’t overstuff the bag.",How to Sneak Food Into a Movie Theatre1," Use a bag, such as a backpack, messenger bag, or purse to hide outside food and beverages. For example, you could hide small snacks such as candy, chocolate bars, chips, fruits and veggies, popcorn, or bottled beverages inside your bag., This way your snacks won’t spill inside of your bag while you are transporting them into the theatre. A sealed container will also mask the smell of popcorn or other snacks in your bag, making them less noticeable., Place a wallet, day planner, or any other item overtop of the food you are sneaking into the theatre. That way, if someone looks inside your purse, they'll just see your personal belongings, not the food.

, Make sure to choose a bag that is large enough to fit all the snacks you want to sneak into the theatre. You should not stuff your bag so full that some of the snacks are sticking out of the top. This is a sure way to get caught. Make sure that the snacks fit into your bag and are not visible."

Hide a small snack or two in your pockets.,
Conceal food you're carrying with a sweater or jacket.,
Hide food in your sleeves.,
Act natural.",How to Sneak Food Into a Movie Theatre2," Wear large and baggy clothing and then hide small snacks in your pockets. For example, you could wear a pair of cargo pants, preferably a pair with plenty of pockets and hide candy or chocolate in the pockets. Take a look in the mirror before leaving your house to make sure that none of the food is visible., In some instances, the food you want to sneak in may be too large to fit into your sweater or pant pockets. If this is the case, you can roll up your coat or jacket and hold it over your arm. Wrap any food items inside your jacket. It will just look like you are carrying your jacket and no one will suspect that food is hidden inside!


Alternatively, you can hide food up the front of your jacket. You may look larger than normal, but chances are an employee will not ask you to lift your shirt unless it looks very suspicious.

, This works best with long skinny items, such as chocolate bars. Hold your arms casually at your sides and no one will look twice.


You can tie the food to your arm using an elastic band or string. This way the food will not fall out while you are walking and swinging your arms.

, No one will look twice if you don't give them a reason to be suspicious. Act normal and do not keep checking your bag or pockets.If you do get caught, apologize and admit that you were bringing in food. Chances are they will just confiscate the food and allow you to stay and watch the movie.

Pick items that are sold at the concession stand.,
Select items that are not loud.,
Choose food that doesn’t smell.,
Select snacks not meals.,
Don’t eat smuggled food in front of the staff.",How to Sneak Food Into a Movie Theatre3," Most theatres sell candy and other snacks that can be purchased at any convenience or grocery store. You can easily smuggle these items into the theatre, because no one will suspect that they were not purchased from the concession stand. It is highly unlikely that you would ever be asked to provide a receipt.Some large movie theatre chains also sell food such as hot dogs, pizza, and burgers. If this is the case, you could try sneaking in larger items.

, Some foods can be loud to open and eat. For instance, most movie theatres do not sell soda in a can. The sound of a can of cola being opened will surely draw attention.If you want to bring your own soda, pour it into a water bottle so you won't disturb others watching the movie by opening the can.
Similarly, you can leave loud wrappers at home by opening up your candy in advance and transferring it to a resealable baggie. This will be much quieter and you can eat the food without drawing attention., When sneaking food into a theatre, avoid foods that have a strong scent. This may cause you to stand out and could increase your chances of getting caught by the theatre staff. Stick to scentless foods, such as trail mix, candy, or bottled water.Don't try to sneak in a burger or onion rings. Not only will the person next to you be extremely jealous, but the scent may draw the attention of the staff.

, As a general rule, you should never eat anything in a dark movie theatre that requires cutlery. Aside from the fact that you will likely make a huge mess, it is also inconsiderate to the other people trying to watch the film. Cutlery is loud and can distract from the movie. Leave your leftovers at home and stick with small snacks and finger foods., Once you are inside the theatre, be discreet. Keep your smuggled food hidden and avoid eating these items in front of the theatre employees. This way you are less likely to get caught."

The movie schedule must be at your fingertips.,
Buy snacks and be prepared to pay more.,
Most movie theaters like it if you buy food from them, but they normally don't enforce the rule.,
If you're bringing your own snacks, wear cargo pants - it's far easier to stash snacks in cargo pockets (just don't stuff them to the gills).,

, Normally, theater lobbies will be jam-packed with people on weekends, so allow 20-30 minutes to get your tickets, get snacks, and then get good seats. Allow extra time for blockbusters, like a Harry Potter film or The Hunger Games.

, If you have kids with you, limit how many extra items they can have. Try not to buy a lot of snacks: the movie seats are generally small, and you won´t focus in the movie if you have to rescue that falling super-size stack of candy.

, A great way to save money on snacks is if you put a box of candy in your purse and pockets. Buy drinks at the theater; if you put them in your bag, they may leak.

, No theater in their right mind is going to ask to search your pants pocket for snacks - too much risk of a sexual harassment lawsuit.

, If you planned ahead and arrived early, you might be able to sit at a desirable seat. The best seats in most cinemas are at the back of the room because you won´t have those annoying seat-kickers, or in the middle as you will have the best view there. Try not to arrive late, or these seats might be occupied by people.

, After you have watched the movie, you can discuss the movie with friends or family that you went with.

Communication.",How to Adapt a Novel to a Movie," If you don't, the movie won't make sense and the people who have read the book will be very angry with the filmmaker. If you read the book, put tabs on it and make notes, so you will be less likely to bomb the movie. Read it over and over, regardless of it's length. You really need to be familiar with the story's plot and its characters.;
, If you can condense an entire book into a few pages then you are ready to make a movie. Try to keep the main things in it without having the film drag on.

, Put only the best quotes into your script. Try not to include everything in the book, as that would get boring very quickly.

, The actors are very essential. They have to deliver their lines or else no one will take them seriously. Hold auditions somewhere with enough space.

, While the budget and schedule will change constantly throughout prep, into production, even up to delivery, you have to start somewhere. The initial budget and schedule will be source of much discussion and compromise, but it gives all the departments a common ground from which to plan.

, Storyboards are drawings of the sequence of shots for a script. It helps to pre-visualize how the director wants the screenplay to be shot and it communicates the director's ideas to the crew and the producers. Storyboarding is mainly there to get a first idea of what the film will look like. It is rarely followed exactly but it is a helpful guideline during the shooting of a film.

, Keep the book with you at all times. The main cast members should read the book as well.


Independent filmmaking: Filmmaking also takes place outside of the studio system and is commonly called independent filmmaking. Filmmakers can conceivably shoot and edit a movie, create and edit the sound and music, and mix the final cut on a home computer.






Most independent filmmakers rely on film festivals to get their films noticed and sold for distribution.






The Internet has allowed for relatively inexpensive distribution of independent films; many filmmakers post their films online for critique and recognition. Although there is little profitability in this, a filmmaker can still gain exposure via the web.







, If you don't have the time to become a Production Assistant, take the tours of movie studios. Some tours can be very interesting. Hollywood Studio Tours While the Universal Studio Tour is more entertainment than actual examples of filming, you can pick up tickets to filming as you leave Universal Studio Tour area. Most are for Sitcoms which are filmed totally different from a motion picture. Yet they are very educational and entertaining to watch.

, Your first day of filming on a low budget movie with a new crew and inexperience actors will look more like a disaster movie than a motion picture set.

, Give the cast and crew as much information as possible, especially when things are going wrong. If you can then print and distribute the schedule to every crew member at the start of each day, if not far earlier. If you're going run over schedule then first explain the situation to your crew, then ask very nicely if they mind working longer and then tell your crew the new estimate wrap time.

Let the story captivate and move you.,
Try not to think about anything else.",How to Enjoy the Cinema," It's fine to go alone; you don't have to take someone, especially if you don't like them. But if you have wanted to hang out with a friend recently then you could go with them. Maybe you could plan a group trip there. Remember to make sure that your friends (if you're at school) don't talk about the trip to prevent unwanted guests showing up unexpectedly or people you haven't invited getting jealous. Remember to pick people that you want to go with, and people who will get along with each other. If they start arguing, it could turn the trip into a nightmare, or get you kicked out of the cinema for being too loud.
, Pick a movie you like; It's no fun sitting through an hour and a half long film and being bored to death, or worse, scared to death. Have a look at the choices and pre-plan the film you want to see, especially if it hasn't come out yet. If you're going in a group, maybe get together beforehand to see what everyone thinks because you don't want them not enjoying themselves., You don't have to eat, but it's sometimes fun to break out the popcorn or pick 'n' mix. Only choose one of the options, because it can be uncomfortable being full and trying to focus on a film at the same time. You could go for a meal before, but that means that you probably shouldn't eat everything at the cinema. Make sure that what you are eating is what you want to eat because if the food is absolutely horrific then no one will be very pleased. If you're an indecisive person and are travelling with a group you should make the decision a few hours before to stop the rest of the group from getting bored, agitated or angry from waiting too long., Although cost can be a factor, time at which the movie is planned to be shown is yet another factor. True, a cinema is a cinema, but some cinemas are better quality or more local to your area. Look at the cinemas in your area and see which one is the best. If you're taking a group out then you should see which one is the most local to all of you- travelling long distances can cause various problems., Although some 2D movies have been made for 3D now, 3D will generally be more expensive, can make some people feel sick, not to mention the glasses making your nose feel funny and being just not the right size. With a group, see who doesn't like 3D. If even one person says they don't like 3D then go and see 2D instead. You don't want them vomiting in the middle of all the seats. If you have decided to see 3D, then remind everyone to take their own glasses., A lot of times during the day aren't suitable to go to the cinema in. Don't go before 11:30, and don't go after 6:00 unless it's a date. If you or a friend you're going with can't make it between these times then it's fine. You can either go at a different time or schedule for the holidays or a weekend., Even though the first part of every film is always trailers, you should get there 15 minutes before the film starts if you're going with a group so you can get any sweets or popcorn, tickets and other things before the film starts. Besides, missing the start of the film can cause confusion later on and is annoying to the people already in the cinema., If you're with a group, make sure they (and you) all turn off their phones. And seriously, not just because the cinema tells you to. Bright lights from the phone distract people from the film and sounds can make people miss a dramatic statement or a witty comment. This also why you should refrain from whispering.

Try to ignore any distractions around you and eliminate distractions so you can have a proper experience.

, If you are, the chances are that people around you are too. This just means that you're having a great experience of the film. If you're with a group tell them so they can feel it too., The story is the basis of the actions you'll see, and which should drive the point ""home"" of whether or not a repeat performance should be attained.

If you start crying, it's ok. Just try not to make a big noise.

, Let the movie on the cinema screen drive what you want to do with the movie till the end, if planned just right."

Often, though, the ""homemade"" aspect of the footage is directly related to the story, marrying the form to the content. Decide what kind of camera you need and what kind of camera you can afford. They can cost anywhere from a few hundred to several thousand dollars. If you already have access to a relatively cheap camcorder, consider filming a story that would work well with a homemade-look.


In the $100-200 range, you've got lots of commercially available home recorders. Companies like JVC, Canon, and Panasonic have relatively cheap cameras that are mobile, effective, and look great. Even something like an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch works great especially because it's easy to transfer videos recorded on your IOS device to iMovie. IOS devices have very astonishing cameras for what they are, and since most people have a phone already, then you don't have to go out and spend extra money. You could also attach an accessory over your iPhone camera like an Ollo clip, which hovers around $60-$100. The Ollo clip comes with four lenses. Cheap cameras can look great, for example: ""The Blair Witch Project"" was filmed on an RCA camcorder bought at Circuit City for very little money.
In the $500-900 range, you've got really solid Panasonic and Sony models that have been used to make films like ""Open Water"" and lots of documentaries. If you're serious about making films, and making more than one film, consider investing in a solid camera.
On an iPad, iPhone, iPod touch or Macbook, there is an app called iMovie ($4.99 for IOS version). It lets you make quick, easy films, yet still look professional.;
, Unless you're going to go quick-and-dirty and only edit on the camera, which would involve filming everything in order and filming only perfect takes, (which is very time consuming). you'll need to import the footage onto a computer. Mac computers come with iMovie and PC computers come with Windows Movie Maker, basic types of editing software that will allow you to edit the footage together, mix in the sound, and even add credits.


You can upgrade to more complex and professional editing software like Video Edit Magic or Avid FreeDV.If these are not available two free but very professional movie editing tools are available Open Shot and Light Works which you can get for free and use.

, Filming an outer space epic in your dorm room would be difficult, as would filming your gritty film about a street hustler in the mall. Look at what locations are available to you, and consider what stories might evolve from that location. The film ""Clerks"" revolves around a bunch of apathetic guys working at a convenience store, and hanging out. Without access to said convenience store, it would have been difficult going.


Businesses and restaurants are often hesitant about letting amateur filmmakers use their property for filming, but you can always ask. Often, people will be excited about the idea of being included.

, With very few exceptions, producing a film involves a large group of people who come together to serve a common goal: a great visual story that deserves telling. You'll need people to act and people to help film. Cast your friends in these roles, or place a callout on Facebook or Craigslist to get people interested in your project. If you're not going to be able to pay anyone, make that clear right off the bat.


If you live in a college town, consider putting up flyers in the drama buildings to see if any local talent might be interested. You might be surprised at how excited most people are to be included in a project like this.

, Because most movies are essentially visual stories, the first step is coming up with an idea that you want to turn into a movie. What's something that you'll have to see to believe? You don't have to have every detail in place, but you should have a basic idea of the premise.


Think about the movies you like to watch, or the books you like to read, and consider what makes them so interesting. Is it the characters, the action, the visuals, or the theme? Whatever it is, keep that element in mind as you plan your movie.
Write out a list of all the props, locations and actors which are currently available locally then develop a film around this. Keep a dream journal, dreams like films are visual stories and dreams. Keep a notebook with you for writing ideas down. Read the news stories in the papers. Have a basic idea, and work with that. Narrow it down as you go along while writing the plot.

, The essentials for building a story from your idea have to do with character. Who is your protagonist? What does your protagonist want? What keeps them from getting it? How will the protagonist be changed? If you can answer all these questions, you're on your way to a great story.


It's been said that all stories have one of two basic premises: A stranger arrives and shakes up the normal way of things, or a hero departs and goes on a journey.
Make sure your story has a beginning, in which the scenario and the characters are introduced, a middle, in which the conflict builds, and an ending, in which the conflict is resolved.

, A screenplay breaks every moment of the story into an individual, film-able scene. While it may be tempting to want to costume-up and start filming every scene as it comes, you'll be in much better shape if you can plan things out before hand and think of your film scene-by-scene.


A screenplay writes out all the dialog, attributed to each character, along with some physical directions, exposition, and camera movement. Each scene should start with a brief description of the scene (i.e. Interior, night).
Think cheaply as you write. For your purposes, it may be much better for the story to cut out the epic 30 minute car chase and instead cut straight to the aftermath. Maybe your lead protagonist is laid up in bed, bandaged, wondering, ""What happened?""

, A storyboard is a comic-book-like version of the film that you'll create, but without the dialog bubbles. It can be done on a large scale, drawing only each major scene or transition, or, if you've got a very visual story, It can also be done at the micro level, planning every shot and camera angle.


This process makes a long film go more smoothly, and will help you anticipate difficult scenes or sequences to film. You can try shooting without storyboarding, but it will not only help you visualize your movie, it will help you explain your vision to the other members of the crew.

, Because movies are visual, it's a good idea to spend some time on the ""look and feel"" of the movie. Consider two films as an example: Matrix again, with its monochromatic, yellow-green tone throughout, which heightened the sense of being “digitized,” and A Scanner Darkly by Richard Linklater, which was rotoscoped and had a unique and memorable cartoon reality look to it. Here are some other areas to consider.

, It’s all there to do. For example, look at Melancholia by Lars von Trier; the opening scenes were shot with a super high speed camera, which renders as a fluid, graceful slow motion. Most of the rest of the movie is shot with a handheld, or “shaky cam,” setting the tone for the emotional and spiritual conflicts that ripple through the movie.

, How do you want the setting of your film to look? Can you film it in a real location, or will you have to build a set? The sweeping panoramas of the big screen epics of the 60s and 70s relied on a combination of wide open spaces and studio-lot sets. Scenes from The Shining were shot at a ski lodge in Oregon. Dogville was shot on a bare stage, with only suggestions of buildings as props.


Films rely heavily on the costumes to communicate essential character traits to the viewer. ""Men in Black"" is a key example.

, Some movies feature soft, almost gauzy lighting that makes the actors and the sets look significantly more appealing, and the entire film more dreamlike; others favor a lighting style that looks closer to reality, and some people push the edges and go for a really hard light that is almost cutting. Check out Domino with Keira Knightley.

, If you're going to shoot on-location, find the area you want and make sure it's available for filming. If you're working on a set, start building and ""dressing"" (or adding props) them.


If possible, using actual locations is easier. Green screens can look very fake in certain locations but you can use one if you want. It's simpler to film in a diner then make a room look like one.

, The director controls the creative aspect of the movie, and is a key connection between the crew and the cast. If you have an idea for movie and know exactly how it should look and feel, it would be a safe bet that the director is you, but if your not good at directing people and your not comfortable bossing people around, then, you can take a different approach on directing or just hire someone else and try to give them the full picture. You'll cast the major players, oversee the filming, and offer creative input where you see fit.

, This person is in charge of making sure the lighting and actual filming of the movie go smoothly, as well as deciding with the director how each shot should be framed, lit, and shot. He or she manages the lighting and camera crews, or operates the camera on a small film.

, This person is in charge of making sure the sets correspond with the director's creative vision. He or she might also be the props master (in charge of the items that fill the set).


Costume, hair, and makeup design could be in the same category on a very small production. On a large production, this person would choose (and maybe even sew) every costume used in the film. On smaller productions, this position is usually merged with another job.

, The sound man may be one or more people. Dialog needs to be recorded either in scene, or looped in later during production. Sound effects, like gunshots and grenades or an explosion, all need to be created; music needs to be sourced, recorded, and mixed; and foley (footsteps, leather creaks, plates broken, doors slamming) all the needs to be generated. The sound also needs mixed, edited, and lined up with the video in post-production. And remember, the music doesn't have to be very loud, it can be quiet in a quiet scene to the point where people aren't focusing on it as it now just acts an aid to capture the scene.

, People in your community might work for screen credits in low-budget films. Of course, it would be advantageous to have a well-known name starring in your movie, but learning to play to the strengths of the actors you do have will ensure that you've got a great filmed product. If you need a cop character in your film, call one up and ask if he'd be willing to film a couple scenes some afternoon. Just make sure that the movie doesn't involve anything illegal while the police officer is there, as this could not end well. If you need a college professor, contact the school.Test the range of your actors. If you know that one of them will have to cry in a sad scene, make sure he or she can do it before you contract for the project.
Avoid scheduling conflicts. Make sure your actors can be available on-set when you need them.
Be careful of stunts that may injure your actors.

, At the very least, you'll need a video camera. You will probably also need a tripod — to mount the camera for steady shots — lighting equipment, and sound equipment.


Filming some ""screen tests"" would be a good idea. Give your actors the chance to practice while being filmed, and give the crew a chance to coordinate their actions.

, Keep track of which ""take"" is the best take for each scene, to help yourself in the editing process later. If you've got to comb through multiple missed takes and bad takes every time you want to find the scene you wanted, the editing process will be a drag.


Make sure everyone's on the same page at the start of each day for filming each scene. It can get a lot to get a whole case, crew, and location appointment together at once, so it might help to write out and distribute an itinerary at the beginning of the process.

, The decisions you make will result in the difference between a ""home movie"" or a professional looking movie.


Some people say to shoot multiple takes from multiple angles because it will be more interesting in the end, giving multiple options for the editing process. As a very general rule, professional filmmakers shoot each scene in a wide shot, medium shot and close up of important elements.

, Take your footage to your computer, upload the files, then log them, identifying what shots work. Put together a rough cut using these shots. The way that you edit your film drastically affects the way the film ends up looking and feeling.


Making jump cuts will hold the viewer's interest and set the tone for an action movie, but long, lingering shots have a powerful impact as well, but done badly this can be very boring. Consider the beginning of The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.
You can also edit to music, which is a fast and effective way of editing; you can also edit to music on a quiet section of the film, by choosing music which provides the right mood.
Editing between various angles can quickly show multiple things going on in the same scene. Use your editing system's split or razor tool to create smaller clips from multiple shots, and then mix and match. You'll get the hang of it quickly, and with digital movie making, your mistakes are always saved by Undo.

, Make sure that your music flows with what is going on during the movie at that second, and that the live sound you recorded with the film comes through loud and clear. Re-record any parts that are important.


Remember that if you are planning on distributing a film using found music can cause problems, so it is best if you can get music specially composed for the film; plus there are many skilled musicians out there who would love to get experience.

, You'll want to name your cast and crew at the end of the film. You can also include a list of ""thank yous” to any organizations that were willing to let you shoot in their establishments. Most importantly keep it simple.

, Make a teaser or trailer. If you want to promote your film online or in other theaters, select pieces of it for a promotional trailer. Don't give away too much of the plot, but do try to catch the viewer's interest.


Also don't forget to upload your movie to youtube or Vimeo, or if your movie gets accepted into a theatre, don't upload the movie to YouTube as you won't make as much money on YouTube Vs. The box office, just upload teasers and stuff like that, and don't forget to advertise other places than YouTube!

Ask about the theater’s policy.,
Go to your parent.,
Hit up that favorite aunt or uncle.,
Appeal to an older sibling.,
Go with older friends.,
Ask an adult outside the theater.Look for someone who’s young enough to have only recently turned of age, who may be more sympathetic than older adults, since they were in your shoes not too long ago.",How to Get Into a Movie You're too Young to See1," Find out how restrictive they are. Ask if they admit children to age-restricted movies as long as an adult purchases their ticket for them. If they don't, see if they'll admit you if you're accompanied by an adult into the theater., Ask them to see the movie with you or to simply buy the ticket for you when they drop you off.If they immediately say no just because of the movie’s rating, argue that the rating system is very inconsistent. Think of a movie that you are allowed to see (better yet, one that your parent made you see) and point out how it’s just as “bad” as the one you want to see now.For example, look at the Star Wars or Indiana Jones franchises or any other movie that’s marketed toward kids despite featuring torture, dismemberment, and high body counts.


Know your parents’ tastes and policies beforehand. If you already know that the movie contains more sex, violence, or other material that they’ll object to you seeing, don’t bother asking, since this will tip them off that you intend to see it.

, If you have one of those aunts or uncles who love to let you do things that your parents wouldn’t normally allow, go to them instead. Ask them to take you to the movie or to purchase your ticket for you.

, If you or your friends have any brothers or sisters of age, ask them to take you to the theater. Judge how best to ask them based on your relationship.


If the two of you have a strong relationship, play to their sympathies, since they too were probably in your position not so long ago.
If the two of you don’t get along most of the time, barter with them. Offer to do their chores or even provide an alibi or some other form of support the next time they want to sneak something behind your parent’s back.

, If you have any friends of age, or who even just look like they are, go with them.Invite as many as you can, the more, the better. Go as a group and blend in with them.

, Ask them to purchase your ticket. If needed, offer a few extra bucks to pay for their popcorn or whatever as an added thank you.


If the ticket window is located outside, stay out of view of theater staff, but stay in view of everyone else when approaching strangers.
Don’t barter with anything more than a little extra money, if even that. Regardless of how young they may seem, don’t agree to do any other favor for a strange adult, even if it sounds innocent.
Don’t be afraid to ask. Unlike buying alcohol for minors, no one’s going to get arrested or fined for buying you a movie ticket (unless it’s to an NC-17 rated film).The worst that may happen is a simple “No.”

Bluff your way in.,
Dress the part.,
Add subtle touches.,
Talk the talk.",How to Get Into a Movie You're too Young to See2," If no one of age will take you, buy the ticket yourself. Be confident.Remember: all you’re doing is going to see a movie–no big deal. Ask for your ticket the same way you’d order your favorite meal at a restaurant that you go to all the time. Act a little bored by the transaction.Keep in mind that you’re not going to get into any sort of trouble for this; the worst that may happen is no ticket.

, Leave any clothes that make you look young at home. Style your hair and choose clothes that older kids wear.Don’t overreach and try to appear too old, though. Aim to look like you’re exactly the minimum age permitted to see the movie. If it’s for 13 year-olds and up, try to look 13; If it’s for 17 year-olds and up, aim for 17; if it's for 18 year-olds dress like 18.

, If an older sibling has a varsity jacket that fits you well, borrow it. Choose clothes that fit your form instead of clothes that you’re supposed to “grow into.” Wear shoes or sneakers that give you a little extra lift to appear taller. Stuff your bra a little. Apply a touch of makeup, but remember: less is more. Don’t overdo it and appear like you’re trying to look older.

, Do the math beforehand and know your fake birthdate in case anyone asks, so you can answer immediately, without having to think.If you’re going with a group of friends, mimic older kids’ conversations while you’re waiting in line. Talk about subjects relevant to the age you’re pretending to be. For example, if you play baseball or softball, tell a true story about a game you’ve played, but substitute your team with that of the school you’re pretending to attend.

"
"
Use plastic.,
Avoid human contact.,
Wait for the line to back up.",How to Get Into a Movie You're too Young to See3," If you already have a credit or debit card, go get it. If not, use cash to buy a pre-loaded debit card from a convenience store or pharmacy, or buy a gift card from the theater.


To avoid suspicion, don’t buy the gift card from the theater the same day you try to see the movie.

, Purchase your ticket online or at an automated kiosk at the theater.Deal with one less person who may wonder how old you are. Remember that once you’re inside, you'll still have to present your ticket to a staff member who will direct you to the particular theater in which your movie’s playing. Wear clothes and accessories that are appropriate for the age you’re pretending to be.

, Once you have your ticket, wait until a few other people approach the staff member who's collecting tickets. The busier it is, the more likely the staff member will wave people through without glancing at anything but the theater number printed on their tickets. If there’s no line, dawdle by the concession stand or pretend to text somebody on your phone until a line builds up.

Use a ticket stub.,
Buy a ticket for another film.,
Sneak into the theater.,
Have an inside man let you in.,
Go to a private screening.",How to Get Into a Movie You're too Young to See4," If an older friend or sibling is willing to buy you a ticket but the theater still won’t allow accompanied children into the movie, have your friend or sibling buy a ticket for themselves. Ask them to head inside to have their ticket torn by staff. After they sit in the theater for a few minutes, have them leave the theater and find you outside so they can give you the torn ticket stub, which you can then show the staff inside for “re-entry,” as if you had already gone in but then ran back out to take care of something outside.Scope out the staff ahead of time. See if they make a point of inspecting ticket stubs when people reenter, or if they just let people in when a ticket stub is shown at all. If they let people breeze by, you could possibly try using an old stub that you’ve saved from a previous movie.Use this trick at a multiplex with multiple ticket collectors. Avoid theaters that only assign one staff member for this job, since they may have a good memory for faces and thus know who has and hasn’t presented a ticket already.Wait for the line to back up, since staff will be more likely to wave stub-holders through while dealing with tickets that still need to be torn.

, Pick a movie that you’re allowed to see. Choose one that starts a little before the one you intend to see. Give yourself time to switch theaters without missing the beginning of the movie you want to see.


If your multiplex has ticket collectors at the door to the theater that you want to sneak into, go watch the movie that you just bought a ticket for. Wait for the movie that you want to see to start playing. Leave the first theater and, if the ticket collectors are gone, sneak into the second. If they’re still there, go the restroom or concession stand as if that’s all you meant to do, and then try again in a little bit later.
If your multiplex collects tickets at the front of the house and then lets you find your own way, just say thanks and sail right into the theater you want to go to once you find it.Use this trick at multiplexes rather than small, two-screen theaters, since you’re more likely to attract attention at the latter due to the lack of space.

, Wait for a movie to let out. Go to a large multiplex, since these often have extra exits located throughout the building. Since these doors are exit-only,wait for a movie to let out, when a crowd will most likely exit all at once through these doors. Join the crowd as it spills out and act like you’re part of it. Then pretend you’ve left something inside. Head inside as though you’re going back in to find what you’ve supposedly lost.


Get your timing right. Avoid loitering outside the doors, since there may be security cameras. Search online ahead of time to find out what movies in which theaters are letting out when. This way you’ll know exactly when to be in place.
Don’t go in as a group. Be believable; one kid running back inside to find something he’s lost is plausible, but a bunch of kids doing the same looks like a bunch of kids sneaking into a theater. If you’re going as a group, have only one person go inside while the others wait for him to come back, which adds credibility to your cover. Once the crowd disperses, have the inside man come back and reopen the door for the rest of the group.
Be aware that this is technically theft.If you’re caught, you may be in more serious trouble than you would be if you tried to buy a ticket for a movie that’s not meant for you.

, Have them purchase a ticket for any movie and enter through the front. Wait outside an exit-only door. Once the coast is clear inside, have them open the door for you.Know the layout. Keep an eye out for security cameras that may catch you loitering outside or opening the door from the inside. Be careful not to use a fire exit that triggers an alarm when opened.
Remember, this is technically theft, so you may get in trouble for this.

, Some theaters screen movies privately for staff after closing-time the night before a premiere. Since these screening are informal, ask anyone you know who works there if you can tag along.

, Dieters have reported that chewing gum can help curb cravings. Instead of munching on popcorn, try a stick of gum with long lasting flavor (avoid the kind that loses its flavor right away, prompting you to keep adding a fresh piece).

, Avoid movie times that occur at lunch or dinnertime. Also, if the movie is playing when you typically have a craving, meet that craving before you go (such as a need for caffeine or sugar).

, Bring the candy into the theatre in your purse, or if you're a guy, your coat/jacket. You can save a boat load of money this way, and you can also buy the candy you like without paying 3 times as much for it at the movies.

, Only allow yourself to spend a certain amount of money on snacks--if you only have $5 then you know you may have to reconsider sizes and amounts.

, If you can purchase a package of licorice at the grocery store for three times less than what the movie is selling it, refrain for making the purchase. Overpriced items will eat away at your budget and put you in a position to pay far more than you should.

Pay.,
Go in early.",How to Buy Movie Tickets Early3," There are some benefits to doing it old school, particularly if you are trying to reserve tickets at a small art theater or if you want tickets for a showing later that day. The person at the ticket booth is likely to give you better service and less likely to turn you down if you have a specific request (such as buying a ticket far in advance)..

, Because many people buy tickets online or just before a movie screening, it’s important to emphasize that you want a ticket for a later showing.

, Another benefit of buying your ticket in person is that, unlike the other methods, you can pay in cash if desired. Theaters generally accept most credit and debit cards as well.

Find a location for your outdoor theater.,
Choose seating.,
Consider the elements.,
Consider where you will set up your movie projector in relation to where your guests are sitting.

",How to Create an Outdoor Movie Theater1," Identify a place in your yard that will accommodate the screen and your guests. If you plan to project the film onto a screen or white sheet that you hang on the side of the house, take that placement into consideration.;
, You could either arrange lawn chairs around the screen or you could get funky and place hay bales or large blankets and comforters on the ground.

, It can get buggy at night so you should have bug spray handy as well as lit citronella candles placed around the perimeter of your “theater.”

Hang a clean, white sheet on the side of your home for projection.,
Create a framed screen.,
Purchase a large piece of wood to be used as the screen.",How to Create an Outdoor Movie Theater2," This may be the most “homemade” but is also the most inexpensive and easiest to implement. Consider ironing the sheet to avoid wrinkles and attach with tacks or a substance that won’t damage your home but still hold the sheet in place. Tack sheet on all four corners and along the top.


Consider using white vinyl instead of a sheet. You can obtain a sheet sized to your specifications, which may be smoother than using the sheet.

, Measure the area where you’d like to hang the screen and then head to the home improvement store. Purchase plywood planks to fashion into a wooden frame (sized to fit the screen specifications). Fit plywood with white butcher paper or a stretched white sheet or vinyl.

, Paint it with reflective white paint and either mount or prop the piece of wood against the wall or chairs, positioned in front of the projector.

"

Test drive the projector you plan to use.,
Wire audio to an outdoor audio system.",How to Create an Outdoor Movie Theater3," You may also need to play around with distance to determine the best resolution between where the projector is placed.

Go for Twizzlers, Milk Duds, or Starbursts.,
Buy a protein bar.,
Look for Swedish Fish.,
Ask about the theater's food policy.",How to Choose Healthy Movie Snacks1," While such snacks are not necessarily healthy, they do tend to be lower calorie than other candy options. If you want to buy snacks in the theater, these are generally your best choice of candy. In addition to being lower calorie than other varieties, they are chewier. This means they're more difficult to eat. If you take longer to finish your candy, you're less likely to return to the concession stand for a second helping.Twizzlers have the lowest calorie count, containing only about 165 calories. Milk duds contain 370 calories, while Starbursts contain 480 calories.
Keep in mind, if you're on a specific diet plan that restricts sugar, this is not the best route for you. While these snacks are lower calorie, the bulk of the calories come from sugar.;
, Many movie theaters now sell protein bars at the counter. You can also sneak one in from a nearby gas station or drug store. Lower calorie protein bars may contain some ingredients you're craving, like nuts and chocolate, while still having some nutrients.Remember to read nutritional labels. Some protein bars may be misleading. In general, it's best to skip bars with a lot of added sugar.

, Swedish Fish are much lower in sugar than the average movie snack. They also tend to have a tougher texture, making chewing them difficult. If you slow down the pace of your eating, you will eat less overall.A serving of Swedish Fish is about 19 pieces, roughly a large handful, and contains only 140 calories and 29 grams of sugar. Movie theater containers tend to be smaller, so you may find a container that has a single serving.
If you can't find a smaller container, try splitting one with a friend.

, As it can be tricky to find candy that's lower calorie at the theater, consider bringing in your own snacks. Some theaters allow this, so ask ahead of time. If the theater does not allow it, you can sneak in food in your purse, bag, or pockets if healthy eating is really important to you. You can bring very healthy snacks from outside, which you would likely be unable to find in a theater. You can try things like:Dry, lightly sweetened cereal
Granola bars
Fruit

Ask for a small popcorn without toppings.,
Have a pretzel.,
Have a hotdog.,
Skip the nachos.,
Bring in savory treats from home.",How to Choose Healthy Movie Snacks2," Popcorn can actually be a relatively healthy snack when made at home. Movie theater popcorn, however, is notorious for extra calories from things like butter and oil. If you want to go healthy at the movie theater, ask for a small popcorn without butter.Serving sizes at movie theaters tend to be large, so you may be surprised how big a small is. Splitting your popcorn with a friend can help you cut back on calories.
If you're really watching what you consume, ask about how the popcorn is prepared. The healthiest popcorn will be prepared with heart healthy canola oil rather than things like coconut oil.

, While pretzels are not necessarily low calorie, they do come with less calories than things like popcorn and nachos. Movie theater pretzels, or pretzel bites, tend to have somewhere between 300 and 500 calories in a serving. If you love pretzels, this may save you some calories if you choose a pretzel over popcorn.In general, dipping sauces should be avoided as they contain a lot of calories. However, if you really want a dipping sauce, go for mustard over cheese-based sauces. Mustard only contains about 5 calories per serving., While hotdogs are not a health food, they do have some protein. This can make you full faster, preventing overindulgence. Also, hotdogs are pretty low calorie. They usually only contain about 210 calories in a serving.Make sure to watch what you add to your snack. Adding things like nacho cheese or chili will send calories from hotdogs skyrocketing.

, Nachos are generally the worst treat at a movie theater. Nachos can contain as much as 900 calories and tend to be very high in fat. While a serving of nachos may be tempting, it's not the treat for you if you're looking for healthy movie snacks., If you want a healthy snack, ask about the theater's policy regarding outside food. Some theaters allow you to bring in food from home. If it's not allowed, see if you can sneak in some treats from home. You may be able to bring in some healthy treats not offered at a theater. Ideas include:Vegetables, such as carrot sticks
100-calorie bags of popcorn
Lower calorie pretzels
Low-fat string cheese

Drink water during the movie.,
Select chewier snacks.,
Opt for food you need to unwrap.,
Bring treats you can suck on.,
Eat a big meal ahead of time.,
Share food with others.,
Chew gum.",How to Choose Healthy Movie Snacks3," Opt for water over soda or diet soda at the concession stand. You can also bring in a bottle of water on your own. Drink water throughout the movie going experience. If you fill up on water, this will help you resist the temptation to overindulge on snacks.Aim to take a sip of water between every bite of food.

, The longer you take to eat something, the less you will be able to eat. Things like milk duds and gummy snacks are more difficult to eat. If you're naturally chewing slower, this will slow down the pace of your eating. This allows you to notice when you're feeling full and stop eating., Treats like Starbursts come in individually wrapped portions. If you have to stop and unwrap your candy between bites, this will also slow down your eating. It's easy to overindulge at the theater, as you're distracted by the movie, but having candy on-hand you need to unwrap helps you be more conscientious of what you're consuming., The longer your food lasts, the less you'll eat. Therefore, bring foods you can suck on into the theater. If the movie theater sells popsicles, grab a popsicle. If they sell hard candy, opt for a bag of something like peppermints., If you go to a movie feeling hungry, you're likely to overindulge on snack foods. Have a big, healthy meal prior to going to the theater. This way, you're less likely to overeat as you're feeling full from healthy foods.Opt for a meal with healthy proteins. These can help you feel full longer.

, If possible, split the calories with a friend. Sharing with others can greatly cut down on the overall calories you consume, leading you to eat less. If you're going to the movies with someone else, ask if they want to split a bowl of popcorn or box of candy with you., Bring a stick of gum into the theater. Chew it after finishing a small amount of your snacks. This will give you something to chew on, lessening the temptation to overeat.Dental gum works best here. It's better for your teeth, and if you're chewing gum that leaves your mouth fresh you may not want to ruin that feeling with snacks.

Arrive early to avoid entering the theater after the movie has started.,
Use the bathroom before entering the theater.,
Let friends and family know where you are.,
Make calls and end text message conversations before entering the movie theater.,
Offer to stand in line for snacks and drinks.",How to Behave in a Movie Theater1," Make sure to get to the movie theater with enough time to park your car, buy snacks, use the bathroom, find your screen, choose seats, and get settled. Adjust your arrival time if you are seeing a recently released movie or if you’re attending at peak hours. This means longer lines and a crowded theater. , Getting up to use the bathroom in the middle of the movie is disruptive. Make sure to locate the bathroom closest to your movie theater before entering. Even if you use the bathroom beforehand, you may need to go again during the movie. Knowing the quickest route will get you in, out, and back in your seat quickly.

, Notifying your friends and family that your phone will be turned off for the next few hours shows respect and maturity. It also helps to avoid disruptions during the movie., Place any last-minute calls and end unfinished text message conversations outside of the movie theater. Talking or texting on your mobile phone during the movie is irritating and rude. This is especially true in 3D movies that require the use of special glasses that react to certain bright lights. , If you’re seeing a movie with a group of friends or family members, offer to stand in the concession line. This shows your generosity and helps keep the group organized. While you stand in line, your companions can use the bathroom, save seats in the theater, and get settled. It also makes their experience more enjoyable and they will be more likely to invite you for another movie.


Make sure to take the group order and ask for money before getting in line. Trying to organize while in the concession line will slow down other movie goers who already know what they want.

Treat movie theater staff with respect.,
Enter the movie theater quietly and choose a seat quickly.,
Turn off any electronic devices.,
Release saved seats when the lights dim.,
Don't talk during the movie.,
Exit the movie theater silently and respectfully during the movie.,
Share your space respectfully with strangers.,
Pick up any trash.,
Wait for the lights to turn back on before exiting the movie theater.",How to Behave in a Movie Theater2," This applies to all interactions including purchasing tickets, buying snacks and drinks at the concession stand, and acknowledging cleaning staff as you exit the theater at the end of the movie. How you treat the staff is a reflection of your own maturity., You will enter the theater at the very bottom or very top of the seating area. Find your seat respectfully without pushing, running, jumping, or talking loudly. If you sit next to another patron, always ask if the open seat is actually available. They may be saving it for someone.

, This is one of the biggest behavior faux pas you can make during a movie. Make sure your mobile phone is turned completely off. The light from your screen can be incredibly irritating to the other movie goers. , If you are saving a seat for a friend or family member, release the seat as the lights dim and before the trailers begin. Seats are generally available on a first come, first serve basis. It is rude to hold a seat for someone who is late over movie goers who have arrived on time. , The sound of your voice may disturb other patrons who are trying to listen to the movie. If you absolutely have to make a comment, make sure to speak in a quiet whisper. , If you have to leave the theater while the movie is still showing, try your best to crouch to avoid blocking other people's view. Be as quick as you can, while also keeping safety in mind. Don’t talk while leaving the theater and try your best to time your departure with an appropriate part of the movie.

, Be aware of shared armrests and don’t let your personal items stray into another seat. Be careful not to kick the chair in front of you. If you experience disruptions, such as a movie goer kicking the back of your seat, address the situation calmly and politely. You can also find a different seat. Keep in mind, everyone has a right to sit where they want, so try to make the best of the situation without disrupting the movie.

, Leaving empty candy boxes, greasy popcorn bags, and emptied soda containers is disrespectful and immature. By cleaning up your seating area, you are treating the movie theater staff with respect. Remember, they have to clean up the theater after every movie for their entire shift.

, Unless it’s an emergency, wait until the lights have turned on before standing up. This shows respect to other movie goers who are still watching the screen. It is also safer as you can easily see where you’re walking."

Watch live performances of professional choirs and focus on what the director does and how the singers respond to each signal.
Go to live choir performances and watch the director. Be sure you choose a seat that enables a clear view of the director. Take notes about what seems to work especially well.
Sit in on a choir rehearsal and watch the director from the singers’ points of view.;
, Writing down the signals that you plan to use will lead to more consistency when used.

, Most signals must be exaggerated for your singers to see them clearly—particularly with a large choir or with children. However, try not to exaggerate so much that the audience would be distracted by your movements.

, Direct in front of a mirror or videotape yourself directing and determine whether your signals are clear.

, The more you practice using your directing body language, the more comfortable you will be doing it in front of an actual choir.


Play your favorite choral music and pretend that you are directing it.
If you know another choir director, ask if you can “borrow” their (already trained) choir for a part of a rehearsal. Then ask for feedback or tips from the singers or the choir director.

, While holding auditions may lead to a more skilled choir, some choir directors choose to give all those interested an opportunity to participate.

, If you decide to have auditions, be sure to do the following steps. If you do not plan to hold auditions, you can skip ahead to the next part.


Secure a time and place for your auditions. For consistency It may be best to hold auditions in the room you in which you will be rehearsing or performing.
Advertise your auditions. Think about the types of singers you wish to recruit and plan your advertising accordingly. You may want to start advertising several weeks to a month before the auditions will take place.
Decide whether to have singers prepare their own piece of music for the audition or sight-read on the spot. This information should be included in the advertisement.

, Listening to each vocalist sing and taking thorough notes about their performance will help you in your selection process.


Evaluate the vocal ability of each singer by noting the range and quality of each voice.
You may want to develop a short questionnaire for singers to disclose experience, describe vocal range, ability to read music, etc.
Maintain a neutral facial expression during each singer's tryout and be sure to remain professional and polite. Someone's feelings may be hurt by a frown or other reaction to a poor performance, or you may get up someone’s hope by seeming excessively pleased.

, Determine the number of singers you need, as well as the voice mix you desire then select those singers required.


If you have very experienced, strong singers, you can form a small group, whereas less skilled singers do better in a large group.
Ensure that you have the appropriate balance in vocal parts: soprano, alto, tenor, and bass.
You may make other balance considerations as well. Be sure to consider other aspects such as gender, age, and race to maintain diversity.

, You will need to notify those who auditioned whether or not they were chosen for the choir by writing a letter or posting a list or phoning.


Be sure to write a short note of thanks to those who were not selected.

, There are many considerations that influence music selection: Is the choir religious or secular? What season is it? If the choir is performing as a part of a larger event, what is the tone of the event? , Music selections should be based on the skill level of your choir, and should be easy enough that they can be successful but complex enough that they will be challenged. , You may want to find music that is in the public domain if you do not have a budget for royalties. , It is important that you know how you want the music to sound before you begin working with pieces with the choir. Meet with the accompanist to discuss the music and your interpretation of it.
Become very familiar with the music, including all of the individual vocal parts, and how you will conduct it before going into rehearsal. Do not try to ""learn it as you go.""

, The plan should include an attendance policy with repercussions for missing practices.


Include date, time, and place for each rehearsal.
Your accompanist should be at all of your rehearsals. If your chorus is a cappella or if you are using pre-recorded accompanying music, you do not need an accompanist.

,


When introducing new music, be sure to discuss in detail the musical piece you have chosen.
Break each piece up into manageable sections. You do not need to work an entire piece in one rehearsal.
Be consistent with the format of your rehearsals. Start with a warm-up, then move to the sections that are to be rehearsed. Be clear about your goals for each rehearsal.

, Working with individuals or small groups can be as important as rehearsing with the entire choir.


Work with soloists to perfect each's part to make their performance more polished.
During sectional rehearsals, split the choir into individual voice parts and rehearse each part separately. This way, more time may be devoted to ensuring that notes and rhythms are mastered.
Reassemble the sections and soloists back together as an ensemble after you are satisfied with their work in sectionals.

, All of the members of your choir should have coordinated outfits that do not distract from their performance and that look professional.


Church choirs may already have choir robes. Be sure to communicate with the church organizers about choir expectations.
Other types of choir groups, such as school or community choirs, may not have preexisting uniforms, but may wear white shirts with black pants or skirts.

, While secondary to singing, skills such as taking a bow together at the end (if applicable) or sitting and standing in unison can make the difference between an amateur and professional looking performance.

, Be sure to include detail such as time, date, and place of performance, featured singers, and hosting organization. Include ticket prices or suggested donation if applicable.

, Warming up will ensure that your choir is ready to sing, and you can be sure that everyone is present.


Try not to introduce any new information before a performance; instead, try to “fine tune” things that you have already worked on.
Give a few last-minute reminders if necessary, but try not to overwhelm your choir with different things to remember.

, Be sure to communicate with the director of the event about how and when to begin the performance, as well as where the choir should sit or stand both before and during the choral performance.


While directing, be consistent. Use the cues, hand gestures, and facial expressions that you used during rehearsals.

, Save any constructive criticism for the next rehearsal: tonight, let them shine!

Follow film marketing companies on social media.,
Sign up for theater newsletters.,
Show up to advance screenings early.,
Leave your phones in the car.",How to Get Free Movie Tickets1," The most exciting free movie is a free movie that hasn't even been released yet, which are often shown in advance to generate hype and get feedback. Look for these opportunities as frequently as you can, since tickets usually disappear fast. More opportunities are available in population centers.


Check GetScreening.com, like their Facebook page, and follow the Twitter announcements for your area.

Visit this fatwallet forum thread and go to the latest page to see recent deals found by other searchers.;
, If one of the sites above asks you for an RSVP code, search online for the name of the movie, the location it's being screened in, and ""RSVP code"" or ""access code."" Searching on twitter is also a good idea, since companies will sometimes give away these codes to followers.

, One of the largest of these is Allied Integral Marketing's 43KIX, which has many local twitter accounts in the United States. To find more of these companies in your area, look at the brand names on the advance screening advertisements or passes found through the sites above, or ask the people running an advance screening event.

, These tend to include a lot of promotions and advertising that don't include the magic words ""free movie."" If you're willing to sift through these for advance screening deals, sign up for the theater chains with a location in your area:


RegMovies
AMC Theaters

, There are usually more tickets given out than there are seats in the theater. Show up at least 45 minutes early to minimize the chance that you're turned away. Some screenings even have receptions before the movie, so you'll definitely want to show up early for those.Some people in San Francisco report the theater filling up as early as 1.5 hours before the movie begins., Some advance screenings do not allow mobile phones or cameras into the theater, to prevent competing studios from recording the film for the purposes of plagiarism. This practice is less common for screenings closer to the release date.

Join reward programs with movie ticket rewards.",How to Get Free Movie Tickets2," Scan the arts and entertainment sections of your local newspapers, both daily and weekly, for ads announcing ""sneak previews"" or other movie deals.


Sneak previews are like advanced screenings, but typically still charge for access. They are sometimes part of extra deals, however, such as 2-for-1 tickets.

, Most major stations receive promotional tickets to give away, especially for long-awaited blockbusters. It will take some luck, but as they say, if you don't play, you can't win! For a better shot at a ticket, make an account on the radio station's website and sign up for the newsletter.

, Most of these sites are filled with promotions for discount popcorn and other less exciting news, but you can get lucky and find a free ticket sometimes, or sign up for a free movie ticket lottery:


Fandango

GoFoBo Sweepstakes

, These are usually temporary arrangements between a theater or movie studio, and a company in a different line of business. Because of this, these arrangements could disappear at any time, and are hard to predict in advance. There are two promotions that have been going on for years, though the details may have changed since they were described here:


Donate blood through United Blood Services to get Hero Reward points. 1,000 points gets you two free movie tickets. If you make online appointments and donate three times a year, you can get 200 points per donation.This means two free tickets every year and a half — not impressive, but you'll be helping a lot of people while you earn them.
Purchase Coca-Cola products with bottle caps or multi-item packaging to get mycoke reward points. Search the online catalog for movie deals. One example is 2 tickets and 2 drinks at AMC for 1100 points, which typically represents about 44 to 110 six-packs.Hopefully, you have a use for all that soda!

Become a film critic.",How to Get Free Movie Tickets3," Contact the corporate headquarters of your local theaters. Some viewers are allowed free movies in exchange for rating the quality of service, choice of movies, customer service, and, in some cases even the quality and selection of the snacks.

, Once you are on the inside, sit back and enjoy (after your shift is over, of course)! This is probably your best option for being able to see free movies on a regular basis. Just be aware that you are at work, not vacation, and keep that popcorn flowing.

, This takes a bit of skill and training, and a bit of luck. But writing for a small paper or website will get you a seat for almost every movie that comes to town.


Be aware that jobs in this area are often very competitive, and even in small communities you will need to have a degree in journalism or communications before most papers will even consider you. Contrary to popular opinion, becoming a paid critic is difficult work.
If you're having trouble breaking into the traditional media outlets, try starting your own movie blog, and start reviewing movies on your own. You'll have to pay at first, but if you provide quality content and earn a lot of followers, you may have some leverage in getting into more and more movies for free.

Select.,
Listen to J Majik and Wickaman - Dubplate Killas


Then listen to TC - Where's My Money
Both of these tunes are in B-flat minor, or have Camelot mixing code 3A.,
Cueing - How you go about cueing your tunes will depend largely on what medium you've chosen to DJ through.,
NB - CD Mixing - unless you are in the privileged position of owning CDJ 1000's, which give you a vinyl-esque readout of the drops in a tune, it can be difficult to judge your drops by section.,
Using these values can be useful for forward cueing a tune, for example if you want to drop a beat with a four 16bar section intro in quickly, you would search to 1.06 secs, then move around a bit until you find a cymbal or the end of a drum roll that usually signifies the start of a section.,
Mixing - This is pretty much down to preference.",How to DJ Drum and Bass," Make sure the two tunes you're going be double dropping are keyed correctly. You can pick up key analyzers relatively cheaply these days (try Mixed in Key) or if you're a musical bod you can probably do it by ear with a keyboard. The thing is, if you're going to be playing two tunes together they, need to compliment each other musically or all the DJ skill in the world won't make them sound good together. For the sake of example, two tunes with the most drum 'n' bass that DJs should have kicking around;
, This means both of these tunes could be played from start to finish and there would not be a key clash anywhere.

, If you're using vinyl you should already know that you can see the drops on your record. In the case of Dubplate Killas, it can be seen that there is a dark section at the beginning of the record, followed by a smaller, lighter section, followed by a large dark section that makes up the main body of the tune. To plan the mix out, it needs to be broken down into 16bar sections. So if we listen and count the beats, you will see that there are have two 16bars sections of beats, then one 16bar section of build before the bass comes in. Where the bass comes in is the most important part of the record as far as double dropping is concerned as it's this point on both records that you will want to occur simultaneously. If you now look at Where's My Money, you can see there is a smaller, lighter section before the dark section of bass comes in. Listening and counting, you see this tune has two 16bar sections before the bass comes in. So, if you start playing Dubplate Killas, you will wait for one 16bar section to play before starting Where's My Money. Now the tunes will both play through their remaining two 16bar sections and both of their basslines will come in together!

, It is recommended to use the time display to judge drops. The time that sections come in roughly on a 175bpm tune are as follows


1 16 bar section = 0.21 secs
2 16 bar sections = 0.42 secs
3 16 bar sections = 1.06 secs
4 16 bar sections = 1.28 secs

, Set this as your cue point, then mix in from here for rapid fire beat dropping!

, As you approach your mixing point, for example, the part when both basslines come in together, make sure the gains on your tunes are pretty much level, cut the bass on Dubplate Killas and pump the bass on Where's My Money. Boom! You now have two tunes playing as one, creating a bespoke live remix on the spot! From here, you can have a bit of fun, cutting bassline phrases in and out of one another, creating a mash up!

Know how intervals are named.,
Use reference songs.,
Practice Solfege.,
Try the Nike method.,
Focus on the most important intervals.",How to Develop Relative Pitch1," An interval is described by its quality and degree. The degree of an interval can range from one to seven. These numbers refer to the seven notes that are in a major or minor scale. The quality of an interval can be “major,” “minor,” or “perfect.” There are 13 main types of intervals.For example, an interval may be “minor third” or “perfect fifth.”
Major intervals usually sound more upbeat compared to minor intervals.;
, Identify songs that you already know that start with an interval that you want to learn. The interval should be the first two notes of the melody. When you hear the melody, you are teaching your brain to recognize the interval.There are online tools (EarMaster.com, VCU Music Theory, AudioJungle.net, and HornInsights.com) to help you find reference songs that you know.Trainear.com is a free tool that allows you to practice and test your skills. Apple has also developed an app called Interval Recognition that you can practice and test yourself with.
This is a good method if you are new to relative pitch training.
""She Will Be Loved"" by Maroon 5 can be used for minor 2nd.
""Poker Face"" by Lady Gaga can be used for minor 3rd.
""Rolling in the Deep"" by Adele can be used for perfect 4th.
The Star Wars theme song can be used for perfect 5th.

, Solfege is a system used to sing notes. The solfege note names are “do,” “re,” “me,” “fa,” “so,” “la, “ and “ti.” Learn which pairs of solfa syllables correspond with each interval. The syllables allow to associate singable words for different notes. This gives your brain a context for understanding intervals.For example, “do-re” is “major second, :” and “do-le/si” is “minor sixth.”This method is difficult if you are not already familiar with solfege. If you are already familiar with solfege, this method will come naturally to you.

, In this approach, you will not use solfege or reference songs. You simply listen to different intervals until you can recognize them and compare intervals to see if you can recognize the differences. You will do this repeatedly until you are able to identify and differentiate between intervals.You are treating intervals as abstract sounds that are not part of real music. It can be difficult to recognize the intervals within music when you have only learned them as isolated sounds.
Use an online interval trainer like intervaleartrainer.com or a mobile phone app (e.g. RelativePitch, Perfect Ear 2, or Complete Ear Trainer) to help you.You can also work with an experienced musician or singer to play notes for you and test your recognition.
This approach is a nice addition to using reference songs.
If you play an instrument, you can play the notes on your instrument and use a tuner to make sure that you are in tune.

, It can be overwhelming to learn all 13 intervals. Focus on the intervals that are the building blocks for developing your relative pitch. Start by learning the major and minor seconds, major and minor thirds, and perfect fourth and fifths.The major and minor seconds are the most common used intervals used in between notes.
The major and minor thirds and perfect fourths and fifths are important for harmony, chords, and chord progression.

"
"
Know the basic triads.,
Play the chords.,
Sing the chords.",How to Develop Relative Pitch2," A triad is three different notes that are each a third apart. Triads form most of the harmonies you will hear in music. The four basic chord triads are: major triads, minor triads, augmented triads, and diminished triads. Each tried is formed by combining certain intervals.Major triads are formed with a pitch, a root, and a note that is a major third above. For example, the C major triad includes the notes C,E, and G.
Minor triads are formed in the opposite of order of a major triad and include a minor third interval and and a major third. For example, C minor triad includes the notes C, Eb, and G. The middle note determines the difference between a major and minor triad.
A diminished triad only uses a minor third interval. For example, a C diminished triad includes the notes C, Eb, and Gb.
An augmented triad only uses major third intervals. For example, C augmented triad includes the notes, C, E, and G#.
Complex chords are made by stacking triads. If you learn the basics, you will be able to progress to more complex sounds.

, Use an instrument, another person, or a website to play chord tones. As you listen to the chord, try to decipher the three different notes that make up the chord. Try to isolate the different sounds in each chord.Visit playingthechanges.com or download MP3 tracks of the chords if you are working on your own.

, After you listen to a chord, sing the notes in each triad. Then, play a different triad and sing the notes. Next, play two triads at the same time, and then sing the 6 notes that you hear.When you begin to combine triads, always break down the sounds into smaller chunks. For example, it may help to play two triads, and only try to find the root note. Then play the same triads and listen for the top note.

"
"
Practice daily.,
Set a time limit for your sessions.,
Focus on one skill at a time.",How to Develop Relative Pitch3," The more you practice the better your relative pitch will become. You also need to practice consistently. Practicing every single day one week and then only practicing twice the next week is not good practice. It would be better to have short sessions every day of the week.Try to do 10 minutes of training each day. This is the absolute minimum.

, If your sessions are too long, you run the risk of overtraining. Your ears will become tired, and you won’t be able to hear the notes as you normally would. If your ears get tired or you are no longer progressing in your training session, take a break or stop for the day.A training session may consist of 15 minutes of listening and singing chords and 15 minutes of interval and chord practice with your instrument.

, Ear training should be part of your life no matter how good you get. Be sure to spend enough time on each skill instead of going back and forth. Write down a study plan that you will follow. Your study plan should include the skill you plan to work on and the length of the training period.For example, you may spend January and February learning major intervals using reference songs, and then spend March and April learning minor intervals using reference songs.
Using computer software like Earmaster and Transcribe can also help you outline your sessions and track your progress.

Listen to music and learn to play along.,
Write music.,
Practice, learn and record.,
Find a teacher.,
Pay attention to what is happening around you.,
Stay away from the temptations of partying.,
Surround yourself with like-minded people.,
Play live as much as possible.,
Keep trying to improve your live show.",How to Develop As a Musician,"


Make sure you are practicing regularly with a solid goal in mind. Playing scales and arpeggios are quite helpful; because if you listen, you'll sooner or later notice that scales and arpeggios form basic building blocks for any melody.
One of the best ways to find your sound is to play along with, and learn, different styles of music that you enjoy listening to.
The transposition of melodies and chord progressions can give you insight into a professional musician's perspective as well as open up your repertoire on your instrument.;
,


Now that you've explored some of your favorite kinds of music you can try writing parts.
Don't limit yourself to just writing blazing solos, rather try writing chord progressions, lyrics or melodies. Gaining insight into all aspects of songwriting will help you develop an ear for the subtleties of music.

,


You may benefit from recording yourself as you begin to grow and develop a coherent sound and voice on your instrument. Acquire a simple 4-track or handheld recorder and record your ideas.
Melodies or other sounds that pop into your head that you might want to remember.
Having access to a recording device to capture these moments will greatly improve your ability to develop ideas into a solid piece of music.
Practice your instrument as much as possible, but it is important that you practice with your mind and not with your fingers.
8 hours of running scales is far less beneficial than 2 hours of concentrated technique and melodic articulation.

,


Once you have found out what kind of music you're influenced by, it is time to find a good teacher.
It would be best not to settle on the first 1 you meet. Try multiple teachers out until you find 1 you can communicate with verbally as well as musically.
It is necessary for the teacher to push you and stretch your limits. Without a dedicated teacher you have to rely on self-motivation and self-discipline, which can be challenging.

,


Once you've developed your voice, you might want to start sharing the music you're playing with other people.
It is very important to be in touch with what is happening in the music industry.
Take note of how other performers behave on stage and read biographies.

,


Excess consumption of alcohol and drugs can lead to countless problems and, in particular, reduce your focus and motivation. You should stay away from the partying lifestyle if you really want to develop as a musician.

,


Being in a band of musicians that has a common goal is very beneficial for your musical development.
You may not be in the right group if you find yourself around people that are not goal-oriented and focused.
Let go of attachments to friends who may be on an entirely different path. It may be hard at first, but, if your goal is to develop as a musician, you should surround yourself with musicians.

,


Up-and-coming musicians and professionals will play as much as possible.
Do not worry about getting paid. Remember, you didn't start playing music for the financial benefits. You may not get paid for a long time, but playing before an audience will help you develop your stage presence and sound.

,


Focus on what needs to be improved.
Write your mistakes down after the show and practice until you eliminate them.

Examine the music's time signature.,
Understand the differences between note values.,
Decipher the note symbols on the page.,
Decipher rest symbols.,
Count the notes.,
Use a metronome to practice.",How to Count Rhythms1," If you have some sheet music, look for the time signature first. The time signature is listed on the left side of every bar (row) of music.When looking at a time signature, the top number indicates the number of beats in each measure or the space between the vertical bars as you read across the music score.
Think of measures as ways of grouping the number of beats in the music into equal parts.
The bottom number of the time signature tells you which type of note counts as a single beat. You're likely to encounter one of three bottom numbers: 2, which signals that a half note counts as one beat; 4, the most common option, which signals that a quarter note counts as one beat; and 8, which signals that an eighth note counts as 1 beat.
Some examples: 4/4, the most common time signature, means there are four beats in every measure, and each beat is a quarter note long. 3/4 is also common, and means that there are three beats in every measure, and each beat is a quarter note long. 7/8 means that there are seven beats in each measure, and each beat is a quarter note long.;
, Different notes cover different lengths of time. The standard note is the quarter note. For most time signatures, the beats are measured in quarter notes.A half note is the length of two quarter notes.
A whole note is the length of four quarter notes.
An eighth note is half the length of a quarter note.
A dotted quarter note is the length of one quarter note and one eighth note.
A sixteenth note is 1/4th the length of a quarter note.

, Notes in sheet music are represented by symbols that consist of vertical lines, open and filled circles, horizontal lines, and flags on the vertical lines. In order to count rhythms on a sheet music, you have to know what note value each symbol stands for.Quarter notes look like vertical lines with a solid circle foot.
Half notes look like vertical lines with an open circle foot.
Whole notes look like open circles.
Eighth notes look like vertical lines with a flag coming off the top and a solid circle foot. When two or more eight notes come after one another, they're connected by a single horizontal line instead of having flags.
Dotted half quarter notes look like quarter notes with a dot in front of them.
Sixteenth notes look like eight notes with another flag. When two or more sixteenth notes come after one another, they're connected by two horizontal lines instead of having flags.

, Rests are simply pauses in the rhythm, when no note is being played or held out. Their values correspond with normal note values. There's quarter rests, eighth rests, etcetera. They have their own set of symbols that you need to be able to recognize.Quarter rests look like squiggly lines.
Half rests look like small bars that lie on the bottom of the staff line.
Whole rests look like small bars that hang from the top of the staff line.
Eight notes look like slanted lines that have a small circle near the top.
Sixteenth notes look like slanted lines that have two small circles near the top.

, Rhythms are commonly counted out loud as numbers, with each number representing a beat. For notes in between the beats, other words and sounds are used.For example, eighth notes in between beats are counted by saying ""and"". Eight eighth notes in a row would by counted as ""1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and"".
Sixteenth notes in between beats and in between eighth notes are commonly counted by saying ""ee"" and ""ah"". Eight sixteenth notes in a row would be counted as ""1 e and a 2 e and a"".
Use all of this information to count the rhythms on the page. For example, a quarter note followed by a quarter rest, followed by two eighth notes, followed by four sixteenth notes would be counted as ""1 *pause* 3 and 4 e and a"". If the time signature in this example was 4/4, that would be the end of the measure, so you'd start at 1 again for the next measure.

, When you're counting rhythms, it's good to have a metronome handy so that you count with a steady beat. Set the metronome to the tempo indicated on the sheet music, if there is one listed."

Listen for the time signature.,
Decide what instrument to follow.,
Understand the differences between note values.,
Count the notes.",How to Count Rhythms2," It's impossible to determine with absolute certainty what the time signature of a song is just by listening to it. This is because a song can have the same sounds written different ways. But you can find what the most likely time signature is, which will work fine for the purpose of counting rhythms.First listen for the pulse of the song. Tap your foot or hand along with the song until you find what feels like the beat. This beat is what you will count as quarter notes.
Then try to recognize a repeating pattern in the song, such as a chord progression or a drum beat. These are the measures of the song.
Then count how many beats are in each measure. That will give you your time signature. For example, if you hear seven beats in every repeat of the chord progression you've got a time signature of 7/4.

, You can only realistically count the rhythm of one instrument at a time. If you're going to count the drums, you'll have to listen to all the different parts of the drums when you're counting. For most other instruments, you'll just count each note that's played.


For example, if you hear a bass drum hit followed by three snare hits, and each hit takes up one beat, you'll count that as ""1 2 3 4"".

, Different notes cover different lengths of time. The standard note is the quarter note. For most time signatures, the beats are measured in quarter notes.A half note is the length of two quarter notes.
A whole note is the length of four quarter notes.
An eighth note is half the length of a quarter note.
A dotted quarter note is the length of one quarter note and one eighth note.
A sixteenth note is 1/4th the length of a quarter note.

, Rhythms are commonly counted out loud as numbers, with each number representing a beat. For notes in between the beats, other words and sounds are used.For example, eighth notes in between beats are counted by saying ""and"". Eight eighth notes in a row would by counted as ""1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and"".
Sixteenth notes in between beats and in between eighth notes are commonly counted by saying ""ee"" and ""ah"". Eight sixteenth notes in a row would be counted as ""1 e and a 2 e and a"".
Use this information to count the rhythm that you hear in the music. If you're listening to a guitar melody, and you hear three quarter note long sounds followed by four sixteenth note long sounds, you'd count that as ""1 2 3 4 e and a"".

Learn your chords cleanly, without transitions, before trying to switch between them.,
Loosen and relax your body into a comfortable, smooth playing position.,
Always fret with the tips of your fingers, not the pads.,
Keep your fingers as close to the back of the fret as possible.,
Keep practicing to build strength and stamina.",How to Change Guitar Chords1," Make sure you can play the chords smoothly on their own. Strum each note of the chord individually, making sure they don't buzz or sound dead. If you can play each note in a chord cleanly every time, then changing chords will be easy. For this article, you can practice with any chords you want. For starters, you might work on shifting back and forth between a C and a G-major chord, two of guitars most common chords.

;
, Keep your wrist relaxed and lightly bent, as if you were cupping an apple in your hand. A relaxed wrist and fingers are key to moving quickly and easily along the fretboard. Your elbow should be tucked in, towards your ribs instead of splayed out, and your strumming hand should be able to move freely from the wrist.









A relaxed body can move more fluidly, smoothly, and quickly.
Your fretting wrist (your left hand, for right-handed players) isn't kinked in front or behind of the neck, it is almost perpendicular to the frets, if not leaned a bit forward.

, The small, hard spot on the tip of your finger is infinitely more precise than the fleshy pad. For faster, smoother transitions, always fret with the tips, curling your fingers away from the guitar to make it easier to land on the fingertips.









If you can't reach the frets comfortably with your fingertips, raise your left knee (for right-handed players) to lean the guitar upwards, classical style. The upward angle makes it easier to get your fingers around the neck.

, If you're playing a note on the 3rd fret, you could technically be anywhere between the second and third frets with your fingers. But you'll get the most consistent, even sound if you're as close to the back of the 3rd fret as possible. Always try to creep closer to the fret you're trying to play for the cleanest transitions and chords.








, Chords take a lot of strength for beginning guitarists. So don't get discouraged when you have difficulties at first -- all guitarists need to build the physical skills as well as the musical skills of playing. The best way to build strength is to keep playing.









Play a tough chord, remove your hand, then play the chord again. Keep repeating this on-off pattern to get faster and stronger with quick chords.
Close your eyes to think about what a chord ""feels"" like. Can your fingers get there without your eyes?"
"
Start with just two chords, working until you can shift the two perfectly.,
Start at a speed where you can sound out each chord perfectly.,
Slowly raise your speed as you get more comfortable.,
Reverse the order of your chords to cement your knowledge.,
Anticipate the chord changes as they come up.,
Apply your chord progressions to real music, not just a metronome, to really learn transitions.",How to Change Guitar Chords2," This is good whether you're learning new chords or practicing a particular transition. Don't complicate things by trying to transition out of ten different chords. For example, if you have trouble getting to C-major, just practice transitioning between C and G until you have it down, then move to C and F, or C and Am.








, Never sacrifice the quality of the chord to play it faster -- it doesn't matter how speedy you are if the notes sound terrible. Start with slow, easy transitions -- don't strum the chord until you feel like all of your fingers are set well.








, You can use a metronome, slowly raising the BPMs (Beats Per Minute), or just your own ear. You want to remain in control, always hitting all the notes cleanly, but you must start to practice at a faster clip to become a faster guitarist. Using a metronome helps you gauge your progress and set benchmarks for faster BPMs.








, It may seem small, but going from a C to a G is different than from a G to a C. You need to practice chord transitions from both directions, so don't just get stuck practicing the same old motion.








, While you never want to rush a song or chord, good players are thinking of the next chord while they're playing the current one. If you know you're going to a C-chord soon, think about the upcoming shape so you aren't caught off guard.








, At the end of the day, you should always apply the skills you practice to real songs and music, helping you put all the skills together in a more enjoyable, helpful way. While metronomes are helpful, real music has a natural swing and feel to it that you only learn by playing real songs. When possible, practice with other musicians, too.

Practice counting while listening to music.",How to Count Music," Music is divided into measures, which are designated by a vertical line. Notes in music are named based on how much time they take up within a measure. Think of the measure as a pie that can be cut into quarters, halves, eighths or a combination of different notes., The names of the notes clue you in to how much of the measure they will take. This will necessitate a rudimentary understanding of fractions. A whole note will take the whole measure. A half note will take half of the measure.


Quarter notes take a quarter of the measure.
Eighth notes take one eighth of the measure.
Sixteenth notes take one sixteenth of the measure.
Notes can be combined to make one whole, for instance one half note and two quarter notes makes one whole measure.

, In an even rhythm tap your heel and count to four repeatedly, like this: 1-2-3-4, 1-2-3-4. The speed is less important than keeping the time even between each number. A metronome can also be helpful in setting an even beat.


Each full cycle of 1-2-3-4 is one measure.

, Say or sing “la” while continuing to keep up the counting in your head. A whole note will take the whole measure, so begin singing “la” at the number 1, and hold it until you have reached 4. You have just performed a whole note.


Two half notes make up a measure. Sing “la” for 1-2 then a new “la” for 3-4.
There are four quarter notes in a measure. Sing “la” for each number you’re tapping.

, For eighth notes you will need to divide the measure into eight even pieces, but you are still only beating four times per measure. Add the word “and” between each number as you count like this: “1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and.” Practice this until it becomes easy. Each word is one eighth note.


Use a similar principle to count sixteenth notes. You will need to fit sixteen sounds into one measure and do it evenly. One common way to do this is to say “1-e-and-a, 2-e-and-a, 3-e-and-a, 4-e-and-a.” Remember that the numbers should still be perfectly even.The same general idea can be applied to ever smaller notes, but as these notes appear rarely they are less important to master as a beginner.

, Sometimes in music there is a small dot immediately after a note. This dot indicates that the note’s length should be increased by 50%.


A half note, normally worth two beats, becomes three beats with a dot.
A quarter note, worth one beat without the dot, takes 1.5 beats with a dot.

, Triplets are when one beat is divided into three notes. This is tricky because otherwise all the notes you have practiced are even fractions. Vocalizing syllables can help you get the hang of triplets.


Practice counting triplets by saying “1-e-and, 2-e-and, 3-e-and, 4-e-and.
Remember to continue keeping the numbers even using a metronome or tapping your foot.

, A fermata is a sign that looks like a dot with an eyebrow over a note. When you see this symbol it means that note can be held for as long as you like, regardless of what the music might say.


If you are part of an ensemble the director will determine how long it should be held.
If you are performing solo consider in advance what will be most appropriate length.
Listen to recordings of your piece if you are uncertain how long to hold. This will give you a sense of what other performers have done and you can decide what sounds best.

, At the top left hand corner of a piece of music you will see several notations. The first is a symbol called the clef, which typically depends on the instrument for which the piece was composed. Next there may be some sharps or flats. Finally you will see two numbers stacked on top of each other. This is the time signature.


For the first part of this article we used the signature 4/4 which is indicated by two fours stacked on top of one another.

, The top number indicates the number of beats in a measure, and the bottom number is which note value gets the beat. It is most common for a four to appear on the bottom, giving the quarter note the beat.In 4/4 time the top note tells you that there are four beats in a measure, and the bottom note tells you that a quarter note is gets the beat.
In 2/4 time there are two beats in a measure, but you are still counting a quarter note as a beat. So instead of counting 1-2-3-4, you would use that same pace but simply say 1-2, 1-2.

, Music set in 3/4 time counts three quarter notes to every measure. The waltz is always danced in this rhythm, and finding a song that is designated as a waltz may help you to hear the pattern more clearly. As you listen count “1-2-3” in your head.


The song “Christmas Waltz” has a distinctive waltz rhythm, and also contains the lyrics “and this song of mine/in three-quarter time” tipping you off to the rhythm.

, The top number always denotes the number of beats in a measure, and the bottom always signifies what note gets the beat. If the bottom number is an 8, then you should count eighth notes. If the bottom number is a 2 then you should count half notes.


6/8 meter is like the waltz in that the beats are grouped into threes, but there are two of them. Beats 1 and 4 should get the emphasis: “ONE-two-three-FOUR-five-six.” Beat one is the strongest beat.3/2 times means you should count three half notes for one measure. One half note is worth two quarter notes. Try counting evenly to six, emphasizing the odd numbers: “ONE-two-THREE-four-FIVE-six, ONE-two-THREE-four-FIVE-six.” By emphasizing the odd numbers you’re pointing out where each half note begins. By counting the even numbers you’re ensuring a regular pace.

, The time signature gives a distinctive rhythmic sound to different types of music. For example, composers often write marches in 2/4 time to give a distinctive feeling of boots stepping 1-2, 1-2.


Pop, country and other music aimed at a broad audience typically has some form of 2 or 4 in the time signature because people like to tap their foot along with the music. Choosing a simple time signature makes it easy for a general audience to enjoy it.
Jazz and other modern music often sounds disjointed because of unusual time signatures, such as 13/8, 5/4 and other uneven divisions. This will be a challenge to count, but may help you see how the time signature contributes to the overall feel of music."

Learn the meaning of time signatures.,
Listen to the song.,
Get a feel for the melody.,
Find out the ""Top Number"".,
Find out the ""Bottom Number"".",How to Calculate the Time Signature of a Song," A time signature represents the length of the melody in a song. There are common signatures, such as quadruple (4/4) and triple (3/4) time. Most songs are written in this time. However, some songs are written in uncommon time signatures, such as 5/4, 7/4, and 9/4. Time signatures look like fractions. The top number represents how many beats there are in a measure, and the bottom number represents the note value which makes one beat.;
, First you must listen to the song fully. Although almost all songs stay the same time signature for the whole song, in some instances songs use two time signatures like one for the verses and a different one for the chorus, and in rarer cases have multiple time signatures throughout (see Prokofiev and Shostakovich symphony scores) .

, The melody of a song is the thing you listen to overall in a song. The melody in a song usually repeats, and is the best way to calculate the time signature of a song. You need to get a feel for when it ends or starts. If the melody is not present, you may want to listen to the rhythms in the drums or such instruments. If the melody is present and keeps repeating, you can start.

, An easy strategy to do this is counting on your fingers. When the melody or rhythm starts, start counting. Every beat, add a finger until the melody starts over, which is when you start at one again. Chances are, the number is 4 or 8, the most commonly used time signature. Whatever number is the one you end up with before it starts over is the top number on the fraction of the time signature.


Be aware that many songs have a ""Pick-up Note"", so it may be more efficient if you base of the accentuated notes, not the beginning note.

, For this, you must find out if the melody is faster than the actual song. A song's time signature's bottom number is almost always 4 or 8. Listen to the bass (or left hand); is the melody twice as fast? Is the melody in 8th notes or 4th notes? If you think it could be twice as fast or in 8th notes, the bottom number is probably 8. If it seems it is in 4th notes, the bottom number is probably 4.

Find a black fancy overcoat.,
Don a tall top hat.Lincoln's look is associated with fancy clothes and a big top hat.,
Wear black dress shoes.,
Wear a black bowtie.Lincoln was known to wear bowties.",How to Make an Abraham Lincoln Costume1," Lincoln may have had a lot of folk sense in him, but he never turned down an opportunity to look civilized and classy. His dress of choice was always a black overcoat. So long as the coat doesn't have any visible logos or symbols, you can use any black overcoat for this.Look at existing Lincoln costumes or pictures of the man himself and decide if any coat you have fits the bill.


A grey vest underneath may help to round off your costume.However, if you can't find one of those, a white dress shirt will do. You may also choose to button up your overcoat.;
, Top hats can be found at costume or consignment stores, or made by rolling black felt and gluing on a rim. Provided you're aiming for a traditional Lincoln costume, you should keep the hat black. Top hats often come with pre-fabricated Lincoln costumes.If you can't find a top hat, make your own. Roll black construction paper into a tube. Stand it up on another sheet of black construction paper, and trace the circle around the bottom (use a pencil so the silvery graphite will show up). Fold the paper in half so that the circle is exactly in half, cut out the circle, and cut a second circle out around the edge, so that you end up with a brim for your top hat. Tape it to the black tube.

, Although they won't attract as much attention as your coat or top hat, it's nonetheless a good idea to round off your costume with a good set of black shoes. The most important thing is that your shoes are black; this way they won't conflict with the rest of the costume. Shoes with a buckle are rarer today than they were then, but they also match the costume if you have them lying around.


Lincoln wore size 14 shoes.
Lincoln's father was a shoemaker., They are not commonly worn in fashion today but you can usually find them for sale at department stores and costume shops. Bowties don't need to be done up perfectly. Rather, an imperfect bowtie will give your costume that much more character. Lincolns bowties were obviously hand-tied, but pre-tied bowties are available as well if you don't want to bother with the tying process.To hand-tie a bowtie, loop the bowtie around your neck, leaving a few inches more on one side. Draw the longer end under the other side of your tie and loop it through the center, tightening it as you go along. Bring the longer end of the bowtie over the other end and pinch them in the middle, looping the longer end through a hole at the back. Tighten it gently."

Get a thick chin beard.,
Wear a set of bushy eyebrows.,
Get Lincoln's gaunt cheeks with makeup.,
Tousle your hair.",How to Make an Abraham Lincoln Costume2," Lincoln's beard was arguably his most distinctive attribute. His beard was based around the chin and allowed to grow quite bushy, without hiding his shirt collar.Look at pictures of Lincoln's beard and groom your facial hair to match this. You can also make a fake beard with construction paper or brown felt. Use spirit gum to attach it to your face.


Although he's remembered for his beard, there were points in his life where Abraham Lincoln shaved his beard. A woman named Grace Bedell convinced him to grow it out. This had the effect of making Lincoln look more trustworthy and warm., Eyebrows are a distinctive trait of Lincoln's.Although not quite as iconic as the beard, they should be considered if you want to make a convincing Lincoln costume. Either purchase some fake eyebrows from a costume store, or make some of your own by gluing pipe cleaner onto thin strips of brown construction paper. From there, you can glue them to your face using spirit gum.

, Lincoln had a very striking face, with sunken cheeks and protruding cheekbones. One way to replicate this look is by using stage makeup. You should first suck n your cheeks. This way, you'll be able to see where the contours of your face are. Next, take a grey or brown stage makeup and apply it to the area that's sucked in. Blend the edges with your fingers.


Because ""gaunt cheek"" makeup is usually reserved for horror costumes, it's a good idea to be very moderate with the makeup you use here, provided you're going for a ""realistic"" Lincoln.You can try different variations on makeup to create different looks. A ""zombie"" Abe Lincoln can be done by using lots of white with black around the eyes., Lincoln was known for preferring to keep his hair unruly, as opposed to smooth. If your hair length is approximately that of Lincoln's, you should tousle it up by rubbing your hands coarsely through it. If your hair is quite long, you can get some of the same untidy impression by trapping all of your hair under your top hat and letting a few strands hang loose.

Accessorize your look.,
Explore making your costume from different materials.,
Try a Babe-raham Lincoln costume.Some women's costumes take the form of a ""sexy"" version of something.,
Combine ideas from different costume sets.",How to Make an Abraham Lincoln Costume3," There are endless creative ways you can spruce up a costume once you have the basics down. Because Abraham Lincoln was a politician, you might consider making a pin that says ""Vote Abraham Lincoln"" on it and pinning it to your jacket. The real Lincoln was also often seen holding pocket watches, so adding one to your costume may be a good idea for the fake of authenticity.


A walking cane is always a good add-on to a costume of this nature.

, A good costume maker won't be limited to the most obvious costume solutions. In truth, there's a virtually endless amount of ways you can make yourself look like Lincoln, without even wearing the proper clothes for it. For instance, you could use paper and black spray-painted cardboard cutouts to make the costume's ""coat"" and ""hat,"" then tie the pieces around your body. This approach can be called the ""Paper-raham Lincoln"" costume.


Don't underestimate the effect of multiple layers in a fake materials-based costume. For instance a ""dress shirt"" underneath the cardboard coat could be made by cutting out some of the cardboard in the middle and gluing white construction paper

, This often takes the form of combining the costume with a skirt and heels in order to feminize it. The ""Babe-raham"" Lincoln costume is a well-known example of this. You can exchange the big coat and pants for a black skirt and blouse. The only part of the original costume you should keep is the hat and chin beard.


The Baba-raham Lincoln costume is a spoof of ""sexy"" versions of Halloween costumes. It can be worn by men and women alike.

, Because there are countless things you can do with a costume, don't be afraid to splice your Abe Lincoln design with other costumes. For instance, a cute cat costume can be merged with a Lincoln costume by taking the whiskers and ears, and throwing them together with the chin beard and top hat. If you have a stockpile of costume materials, you should experiment with different combinations using what you already have.


You get bonus points if you're able to make Abraham Lincoln pun from the combination you've created.

Speak with civility and politeness.,
Approximate Lincoln's accent.,
Talk using a tenor voice.,
Watch the movie Lincoln.",How to Make an Abraham Lincoln Costume4," Lincoln was no pushover, but all of his recorded speeches make him out to be a very down-to-earth, respectable and noble-minded speaker. If you want to be a great Abraham Lincoln, you should act with nobility no matter where you are. Keep your volume levelled, and don't speak out of turn. However, when you do speak, you should do so with force and conviction. This manner of speaking is a good part

, If you want to go the extra mile, try to nail his likely accent. Compared to modern accents, Lincoln might be pegged somewhere between a Kentucky and Indiana accent.Look up examples of these accents and pick up on the ways in which particular sounds are inflected. Contrary to what you'd think, many accounts state that Lincoln had a soft, light voice, ""like a bird"".


Actors have tried to replicate Lincoln's way of speaking. Look at a reading of Lincoln's speech and get a hang for the way an actor will inflect his voice., Although no recordings of Lincoln's speech exist, historians have done research and concluded that Lincoln's voice was considerably higher-pitched than the usual baritone we hear from politicians.His voice was however not shrill or silly sounding. If you have a naturally deep voice, try to sound a bit higher than you normally would.


Edison's first recordings of human speech occurred 12 years after Lincoln's death. This makes it anyone's guess what he really sounded like., Steven Spielberg's 2012 Lincoln biopic has been acclaimed for its historical accuracy.In particular, a lot of attention has been given to how true Daniel Day-Lewis' performance is to everything we know of the man. If you want to get Lincoln's inflections and personality down, you should watch the film and try to emulate the actor on screen. Take care to note the way Lincoln talks, as well as the manner in which he moves.


If you were still stumped on certain aspects of your costume you should look at the way the film's costume crew approached Lincoln's look.

The basic female Renaissance garb is the wenches outfit, and the top portion will consist of a blouse and a bodice. For the blouse, you want to look for something long sleeved and plain. For the best look, go for something light colored, preferably white or off-white.When it comes to fabrics, if you want to be more authentic looking, try to find completely natural fabrics, or blends with small amounts of polyester. Common fabrics used in Renaissance fashion include wool, cotton, leather, and linen. Fabrics like silk, satin, and velvet were reserved for the upper classes.
Women can use poet shirts instead of blouses as well. Poet shirts are baggy shirts with large long sleeves. Stick to the same fabric and color guidelines as the blouse.;
, For the bodice, you want to look for a sleeveless button up top or a vest. The bodice has more flexibility when it come to color. Stick to earthy, muted tones, and avoid bright colors, especially purple, as that was reserved for royalty., Women in the Renaissance wore long skirts that went down to their ankles. Look for one in a muted, earthy color, like brown, olive green, or off-white.


Two skirts is better than one, if you can find two, as it adds more texture and shape to the garb. Make sure their colors don't clash.Alternatively, you can look for a dress, rather than a skirt and blouse. Just make sure the dress goes down to ankle or floor level, and isn't in a loud color or modern fabric.

, Throw everything you thrifted for your garb into the wash. Let them get and stay a little wrinkled to make them look more worn in., You can wear the blouse and the vest as is, or you can alter them to look more Renaissance-like.Here are some ideas:


If you got a white blouse and you want to make it less bright white, you can throw it in a pot of boiling water with some tea bags. Let it sit for five minutes. Then throw it in the dryer.
Renaissance women wore low necklines, so if the blouse has a neckline that's too high, you can cut it down to size. Lay it out flat then mark where you want the new neckline with a pencil. Cut it carefully, then stitch the new neckline with either a thread that matches the color of the blouse or something like olive green or brown.
You can do the same with the vest or button up sleeveless top. The over blouse should have a little lower neckline so that the neckline of the blouse shows through.

, When it comes to the shoes, they should be plain and leather. Flats or sandals will work, as long as they're as simple as you can find.

, Lower class men in the Renaissance often wore what's called a poet shirt. This is a baggy shirt with large long sleeves, almost always white or off-white. Think of a classic pirate shirt. Look for one made of a natural fabric like cotton or linen.


You can choose a different color if you want. Brown and olive green work well.
Instead of a poet shirt, you can opt for a tunic if you wish. These are long-sleeved shirts that go lower than normal shirts. Look for something in a natural color and of a natural material.

, You might already own some cotton trousers that will work for the garb. If not, look for some in a dark color, dark brown or black. They should be long enough to tuck into boots. Fabric is the most important factor here. They didn't have denim back then, and plain khaki pants won't look right either. Look for a light fabric, preferably cotton or linen, or something that looks like cotton or linen.Alternatively, you can look for pants that come down to just past or just above the knee. If you can sew elastic into the openings to make them resemble bloomers, even better.

, The vest will make your basic male garb complete, besides the shoes and accessories. The vest should be dark colored like the pants, and simple and plain.A leather vest would be ideal, but you have a lot of freedom with fabrics here, so just look for something that you like the look of.

, Boots will complete your look, as your trousers should be tucked into them. Look for the most nondescript, basic black or brown leather boots you can find. Something like cowboy boots will not fit in.If you've chosen to wear pants that go to the knee instead, you could wear some leather sandals instead.

, The accessories can add a lot to your look. Here are some ideas of things to add to your garb.Belts are a must for men. Simple brown belts work just fine. If you've chosen a tunic for your top, the belt will go over the tunic.
Large leather belts or sashes tied around the waist can add a lot to female garb.
Drinking vessels and pouches are both convenient and period appropriate. Look for leather or faux-leather.
Bandanas pair well with peasant garbs. The same fabric and color guidelines as the rest of your garb apply.

, Men's and women's Renaissance garb can optionally include layers of under-clothing appropriate for the time period. This usually includes an undershirt to go under men's vests or coats, and chemises and petticoats or under-dresses to go under bodices and skirts for women.


The lack of under-layers won't hurt your garb's look though, so if you can't find any while thrifting, don't fret.

, It was considered improper to be seen in public without a hat or head covering during Renaissance times, so be sure to include one when making your costume. Head coverings can vary a lot, so feel free to get creative here. You can stick with the simple bandana or you can include a hat on top of it, or instead of it.Examples of proper head wear during the Renaissance include: muffin caps, biggins, flat caps, felt hats, and straw hats.

Cut your headband material so that it is the right length to fit around your head.,
Add leaves to your headband.,
Spray paint your crown gold if you'd like it to be gold.,
Tie a belt around your toga.,
Wear the right shoes to enhance your outfit.,
Add the right accessories to your costume to complete the Greek goddess look.,
Customize your look to be a specific Greek goddess.",How to Make a Quick Greek Goddess Costume," Use a large sheet of white or tan fabric. You can also use a bed sheet if you don't have a large sheet of fabric. You won't need to sew your toga, you'll just have to tie the corners of the sheet in a knot.


Use a fabric that is not too stiff. A fabric that flows or drapes will help create the draped look of a toga.
If you're worried about modesty or warmth, you can always wear a white top and white bottoms underneath your toga.;
, The longer length of the sheet should be horizontal when you're ready to wrap your sheet around your body. Hold the sheet so that it is against your back. Once your sheet is in place, wrap it length wise around your body with the top end of the sheet just under your armpits.


If the sheet is too long, fold the top over a few inches to make your sheet your desired toga length.

, Reach around your back to pull the sheet corner across your back and over your right shoulder. This will serve as the strap of your toga. (Most togas usually have a strap over just one shoulder). Hold this corner in place while you continue to wrap the other end of your sheet around your body., Wrap the left end of the sheet around your entire body one time. Once the end of the sheet is back in the front of your body, pull the left corner of the sheet toward your right shoulder and tie it in a knot with the right corner of the sheet.


Double knot the sheet corners to make sure your toga strap is secure. Tuck the ends of the corners into the knot or into the fabric so that they are no longer showing.
Look at Make a Toga out of a Bedsheet for detailed instructions on multiple ways to make togas., Many Greek goddesses wore a crown or headpiece of some kind, and adding a crown to your costume will help distinguish it from a generic Greek toga costume. You'll need something to be a thin headband – this can be a piece of string, wire, thin elastic, or thin rope. You'll also need fake leaves and scissors.


Getting gold spray paint is optional but not necessary.
If you don't own these supplies, they can be purchased online or at any local craft store (such as Michael's).
If you find a piece of fake vine while shopping for supplies, the vine itself will work as your Greek goddess headband. Simply cut it to the proper length and tie the ends so that it fits on your head., Make sure to leave enough room at each end of your headband material so that the ends can be tied together. You'll want your headband to be loose enough to easily take on and off, but tight enough so that it won't fall off.

, Take your scissors and cut tiny holes in the center of your plastic leaves. After you've cut the small holes in your leaves, slide them onto your headband one at a time. Some people like to add tons of leaves, and some people like to add just a few – it is completely up to you.


Once you've added all of your leaves to your headband, tie the ends of your headband to finish your crown.

, Set your crown on top of old newspaper or paper towels so as not to get spray paint on any furniture. Continue to spray paint the crown until it is completely gold.


Allow the spray paint to dry 10-15 minutes before you put it on your head. Let the paint dry while you add the finishing touches to your costume., Instead of a modern belt, use a piece of rope, or gold fabric / string as your belt. Wrap the material around your waist a few times before tying it in a knot to add to the layered look. This will give you a more authentic looking costume. Tie your belt in a knot rather than a bow.

, If you want to look like a Greek goddess, then you must wear the proper shoes. Don't wear boots or sneakers. Instead, wear gladiator sandals, or even strappy sandals. Ideally, your sandals should be gold or tan in color.


If you don't own gladiator sandals but want to get the gladiator sandal look, get some extra string or ribbon and wrap it up around your calves, tying it just below your knees.

, Accessories always make the outfit, whether for a costume or real life. Once you've added your accessories, you'll have a beautiful costume good enough to win you first place at any costume party.


These accessories can include gold bracelets, gold rings, gold earrings, gold arm cuffs, and gold broaches to pin onto your toga.Finish your look with wavy hair and natural looking, shimmery makeup.

, For example, carry a small instrument if you want to be a Muse. Or, carry the trademarks of the famous Greek goddesses. Aphrodite could carry a dove (fake birds are usually available at most craft stores), Artemis a hunting bow, and Athena would wear a battle helmet rather than a crown.

Think of what you want your soldier to be.,
Research military uniforms in history books, online, or by watching vintage newsreel footage on the History Channel or the Military Channel Before you can start building your outfit you need the basic clothing.,
Start out looking at military surplus stores to see what kind of things you can find.,
Find a helmet.,
Search online specialty shops to look for reproduction items if you cannot find authentic ones repro is better because original will ruin too easily and you will have to keep buying thread for it every time.,Beware if you shop at online auctions, both because authentic uniform items are serious collector's items and can command a very high price, and because reproduction items may be misrepresented as genuine vintage, you will need to be careful if purchasing there.,
Assemble what you have bought into however you like it but is better to follow regs to make it more authentic.,remember and always keep in mind if you can't find good things online then print a photo of a uniform and go to walmart or sears and find as close as possible to what's in the photo and try your best to find a good army surplus store near you.",How to Make a World War Two Costume," airborne, infantry, rangers, marines? The choice is yours, and each group has its own distinctive uniform and gear.
, Here are some of the variety of items included in a typical uniform, but note that they are not universal.

Trousers, only service dress has khaki so no khaki, only olive drab or faded olive drab(looks like khaki).
Shirt
Field jacket or winter coat.
Boots, usually midcalf in standard brown corcoran jump boots, marine boondockers, rough out boots or buckle combat boots, unlike modern military uniform boots.
Helmet with helmet liner
M-1938 canvas Leggings
Ammo belt that matches weapon such as M1 Garand, Thompson, Browning Automatic Rifle(BAR), or M1A1 carbine(with no bayonet lug)
M-1936 field bag (Musset) bag
Aluminum chain on cap(water only anything else may cause aluminum poisoning)canteen
Haversack, musset bag, M-1944-45 field pack, rucksack with bedroll, poncho, shelter half, shaving kit, 2x4 metal mirror, skivvies(underpants), extra t-shirt k-rations and assorted gear
Knife, entrenching tool, mess kit, and other gear may be included.

, You should look for an olive-drab HBT (herringbone twill) uniform shirt, a m-1943 field or m-1941 jacket. This should somewhat resemble the look you want. You will also need HBT uniform pants that are the same color, these will be easier to find., Look for the World War II helmet design (paint it later), they are quite common. These helmets are also quite heavy so if you are making this for a little one you might find a fiberglass or plastic helmet liner( which is what goes inside) as this is much lighter., Wardog Militaria.com and By- The- Sword.com are examples, but with the growing popularity of reenactments and interest in military history, there are lots of other sites to choose from.,, You may use vintage photos to help get an idea how the uniform should look, or you might visit a military museum to look at their displays.,"

Find an earthy-colored material.,
Make a Pocahontas style dress (see the photo for the shape).,
Attach a cotton material belt.",How to Make a Pocahontas Costume1," Choose one made of cotton or other light plant matter, such as hemp or linen. Make sure you have enough material to create a dress for your shape and height.


You'll probably want a lighter or darker brown for an accent color, too. This will be at your waistline and as fringe on the top and bottom. Be less concerned with the texture of this accent color -- but for your dress, make sure it won't irritate your skin.;
, Basic patterns can be found online or at any fabric supply store. What's more, you can pick a pattern that you think will look best for your body type.


Don't forget to include the strips at the base of the costume and at the top half of the costume. To create the fringe, just cut strips in a wide layer of fabric and attach to the top and bottom seam.

, A thin rope would also work. Anything that is earthy and doesn't scream factory-made will do the job.

Buy two lengths of faux-suede material.,
Fold one piece of your material in half.,
Cut the neck area.,
Cut the fringes.,
Grab a second piece of material for your skirt.,
Cut out your skirt material.,
Cut the fringe.",How to Make a Pocahontas Costume2," Pick any shade of brown you like. If you don't know how much to buy, consult an expert at the fabric store. An average sized female will need around 2 yards (1.8 m).

, One of the edges where it's folded over will be your head hole. Fold over that corner.


Cut your poncho to the desired length; remember to account for slits that will become fringe. This will depend on your height and your coverage preferences.

, Turn your material inside out before you begin cutting. Cut across the corner you previously folded over.


Sew the open edge, creating a poncho-like shape. The other side is folded and doesn't need to be sewn. Turn it right side out again.

, If you're not comfortable eyeballing it (or don't have a lined sewing mat), turn it inside out and mark lines down the sides with a ruler and pen. The fringes can be any length, but they should be about 1"" (2.5 cm) wide and evenly spaced.


For a grown woman, fringes almost a foot long are appropriate if using a full torso-covering poncho.

, Use a skirt you have in your closet already for a rough pattern. The amount of material you need will depend on how long you want your skirt to be.

, An asymmetrical edge is the quintessential Pocahontas look. Aim for around the mid-thigh and end around the knee. But again: remember to leave length for the fringe! Pocahontas' booty was not hanging out.


Sew the edges about 2/3 of the way down, depending on your skirt length. This is because you'll be cutting away at the material anyway for the fringe. You won't need an entire seam sewn.

, You'll want fringe that looks similar to the one on your poncho. Use strips of similar width and length. They do not have to be perfect -- in fact, imperfect fringe may look better and not so geometrical.


Use an extra piece of fabric as a belt to keep the skirt up, if need be. The poncho should cover up the top of the skirt, so if you have an awkward issue, it can be easily remedied.
If you have more material left over, cut fringes into it and stick it into your shoes or boots! Footwear? Check!

Purchase a tan t-shirt that's much, much, much too big for you.,
Cut off the sleeves from the armpit to the neckline.,
Cut off the bottom seam of the shirt.,
Cut the sleeves into fringe.,
Cut double mini slits into the bottom edge of your skirt.,
Make slits in the back of your shirt.,
Add fringe to the bottom of your shirt.",How to Make a Pocahontas Costume3," You'll need extra length for the skirt, too. This will be your entire outfit, so go for length in addition to diameter.

, But you need the collar, so don't touch it! That's going to be how your shirt stays on. This will be easy if you spread the shirt over a flat surface.


Also cut off the bottom 1/3 of the shirt. Eyeball how long you want the top and skirt. If you want a longer skirt, cut a longer bottom piece. Account for your butt and hips -- they'll make a long-looking skirt into a short one.

Two tan shirts are always an option. They're pretty cheap and can be found at most craft supply stores.



, This will be your belt, so don't mess with it too much -- you are using it later. Cut one slice into the loop, forming a long strip.


About 1"" (2.5 cm) from the edge of your skirt, start cutting tiny slits for the belt to be inserted into. They should be 1-2"" (2.5-5 cm) apart and only big enough so the belt can go through the holes.

Thread your belt through these loops. You may start at the center, side, or back, depending on where you want your bow. Double knot the ends for securing.



, Take 1"" (2.5 cm) wide sections and cut off strips of fabric. You should have a bunch of loops of fabric (and no semblance of a sleeve) once you're finished. Cut into all of them creating a handful of strips of brown fabric. When the edges curl in, don't fret: you want them to. This outfit is about the right imperfections.

, This will be what anchors the fringe. A double mini slit is basically two mini slits very close to each other with a very narrow strip of fabric in between. You're going to lace the fringe you just made into these slits.


Start about 1"" (2.5 cm) from the bottom edge of your skirt. Each set of two slits should be about 1"" away from each other. Once you've laced all the fringe into the slits, double knot them, securing them to your skirt.

, They should be about 3"" (7.5 cm) across at the top and get bigger as the material gets wider. Start about 2-3"" (5-7.5 cm) away from the neckline.


Cut one giant slice through the back of your slits so you have a whole bunch of pieces to tie together. Go right through the center so all your eventual knots line up.

, Use the same method as you used with the skirt. If your neckline is looking a little bare, add fringe to it too, cutting double mini slits and using any extra fringe you have from the remaining sleeve.


If your neckline is looking too t-shirt-like, take two pieces of fringe and tie them each in a bow on the left and right sides of the front of your necklace. This will create more of a square shape and do away with the t-shirt vibe.
Have someone else tie up the back of your shirt. They'll be able to contour it to the shape of your body.

Wear bronzer on your cheeks to give yourself a tanned look.,
Wear a wooden beaded necklace.,
Find a long flowing dark wig at a costume hire store or similar outlet.,
Braid a headband.",How to Make a Pocahontas Costume4," Don't go too overboard -- Pocahontas certainly wasn't orange. If your skin is pale, go for a sunkissed look with blushes and bronzers.

, If you made it yourself, all the better! Check out images of Pocahontas online if you want to imitate the Disney character. Hers was blue with a white pendant.


The necklace is a good opportunity to add color to your costume. Consider armbands and bracelets as well, but don't go overboard. Pick one or two accessories. Less is more here.

, If you'd like to make it more manageable, braid it into one or two long braids. Pocahontas doesn't have to have dark hair, but it is the traditional look.


If you have long hair already, you may want to invest in a swimming cap to keep your tresses from sneaking out and putting a damper on your completed look.

, Use the same material you used to make your outfit. Cut three long strands and braid them together, starting with the end knotted.


Braid enough to wrap around your head, but leave loose ends to dangle. You can then attach beads or feathers to the hanging ends to spice up your outfit. Just tie at the base of your head and then again at the bottom of the strands.

Create a historically correct pilgrim costume.",How to Make a Pilgrim Costume," On a flat work surface, set out a piece of 12-by-18 inch white construction paper. You will also need a pencil, a ruler, and a pair of scissors. To create the two slits:


Along one of the two 18 inch sides, measure and mark the following lengths in order: 6 ¼ inches, 1 inch, 3 ½ inches, 1 inch, and 6 ¼ inches.
The two 1 inch sections will serve as the bases of the two triangular slits. To create the legs of the two triangles, measure and mark a 3 inch line from each end of the 1 inch base.
Cut out the two 3-by-3-by-1 inch triangles.;
, To form the hat, you will make four folds. The first fold will create the brim. The other three folds will create the back of the bonnet.


Create a 2-by-18 inch fold along the paper’s uncut edge.
Fold down the center flap (the section between the two triangular slits).
Fold the outer two sections over the center section so that they overlap.
Staple the outer two sections together or run a piece of scotch tape along the seam., Cut out two 12-inch pieces of white ribbon. On each side of the bonnet, attach one ribbon under the brim with a piece of scotch tape. Place the bonnet on your head and tie the ribbons in a bow under your chin., On a flat workspace, set out a piece of black poster board, a ruler, a pencil, and a pair of scissors. While you can create your own hat shape, you may also use the measurements listed below. To create the pattern, lightly draw the following lines on the poster board:


Draw a 5 inch (12.7 cm) horizontal line near the top of the black poster board. This line will form the top of the hat.
Draw two 10 inch (25.4 cm) angled lines from the ends of the 5 inch (12.7 cm) horizontal line. These two lines should be angled out towards the respective edges of the poster board.
Connect the two angled lines with a horizontal line. This line will form the base of the hat and should be parallel to the 5 inch (12.7 cm) line.
Draw one 1 inch (2.54 cm) vertical line up from each end of the base line, so that the 1 inch (2.54 cm) lines are perpendicular to the base line.
Connect the top of each 1 inch (2.54 cm) line to the 10 inch (25.4 cm) lines with a horizontal line. This will create the illusion of a hat brim.
Cut out the hat along the lines., A headband will attach to the backside of the hat. To create the headband:


Measure and mark three 1-by-10 inch (2.54-by-25.4 cm) strips of black poster board.
Carefully cut out the strips.
Staple two of the strips together at the ends.
Wrap the two strips around your head. If the band does not wrap around your head, add the third strip.
Place the hat upside down on the table so that the pencil marks are facing up. Lay the band across the base of your hat and center it. Staple the band to the center of the hat., On a piece of gold cardstock, measure and mark a 3-by-3 inch (7.62-by 7.62 cm) square. Inside the first square, create a 2-by-2 inch (5.08-by-5.08 cm) square. There should be a 1 inch (2.54 cm) edge between the two squares. Cut out the larger square and then cut of the smaller square. Glue the square to the center of the hat.


In addition to the gold buckle, you can add a brown band that sits just above the brim of the hat., Once the glue is dry on the buckle, pick up the hat and carefully wrap the headband around your head. Ask a friend to mark where the two bands overlap. Take the headband off, match up the two marks, and staple the ends together.


If there is a lot of excess paper, you can trim the ends of the band., Lay your white 12-by-18 inch piece of white construction paper on a flat surface. Fold the paper in half lengthwise. Fold the paper in half widthwise. With a pair of scissors, round the open corner of the folded paper (the corner not attached to any seams)., Unfold the paper once so that the paper only has one crease. Draw a 6 inch line centered along the folded edge of the paper. Connect the two ends of the line with an arc. Cut out the semicircle., Unfold your paper the rest of the way. Cut a slit along the central fold that runs from one of the 12 inch sides to the neck hole. Stop once you reach the neck hole., Cut two 12-inch pieces of yarn. With a piece of tape, attach one piece of yarn near the collar to the left of the slit. Attach the second piece of yarn near the collar to the right of the slit. Put on the collar so that the slit runs down the front of your chest. Tie the yarn in a bow., You can assemble an iconic female pilgrim costume with clothing from your own closet. Put on a long black skirt, a black long sleeve top, and a pair of black dress shoes. Complete the look with your homemade bonnet and collar.


You may add a white apron to the costume too., You can pull together a costume that matches the iconic, albeit mythical, depiction of a male pilgrim with items from your own wardrobe. The basic costume consists of black dress pants, a black button up shirt, and a belt with a gold buckle. If you don’t have shoes with gold buckles, cut out two paper buckles and tape them onto a pair of black dress shoes. Complete the look with your homemade hat and collar., Contrary to popular belief, pilgrims didn’t dress in all black or accessorize with gold buckles. While they wore black and gray clothing to church on Sundays, the puritanical pilgrims wore colorful clothing throughout the week. Instead of gold buckles, which were extremely expensive and not popular at the time, the pilgrims laced up their pants and shoes with leather ties. If you want to dress as an everyday pilgrim, wear simple, colorful clothing, shoes that tie, a collar, and a hat or bonnet."

Create mouth effects.",How to Play the Spoons," The ideal spoons for you to play with will be identical. Each should have a flared base and a decently deep hollow part, which is called the cup of the spoon. Heavier spoons will have more heft and will sit in your hand more comfortably.


Avoid spoons with handles that narrow toward the end opposite the cup of the spoon.
Soup spoons are an excellent option and create a great tone.
Silver spoons might work to accompany certain kinds of music, but these are generally too high pitched and ring too much to work well with most tunes.;
, Put your non-dominant hand, likely your left hand, in a stationary position about 5 inches above your leg. Keep your hand flat, with the palm facing downward toward your leg. Your dominant hand, which is likely your right hand, should go between your left hand and your leg. This hand should also be flat, with your palm facing down at your leg.


Bounce your right hand between your left hand and your leg to create a clapping sound and get used to the motion used to play the spoons.
Advanced spoon-players add a flourish to their routine by moving their spoons and left hand around their body. This can have a slight influence on tone, but is largely for show.

, This will help prepare you for the complex rhythms you’ll soon be making with your spoons. Try to keep a steady beat, and use slow/fast strikes to create patterns with the sound. The accent for most music falls on the second and fourth beats; try this accent with your hands.


Another pattern you might want to try with your hands: bounce your hand off your leg and up into your non-dominant hand in a short-short-long-short pattern. Repeat this several times until it feels natural., Hold the spoon with your dominant hand. If this is your right hand, the first spoon should lay across the middle knuckle of your right pointer finger, with your hand position so that your thumb and the cup of your spoon are both facing upwards.Your pointer finger should curl into a fist, so the end of that finger can hold the flared end of the handle of the spoon, trapping it in place.
Your thumb will cover the top of the handle of the spoon.
Your spoon should cross the knuckle about a half inch or so from the back of the handle of the spoon.

, Hold your second spoon between your pointer and middle fingers, laying across the middle knuckle. The cup should face downward, so the backs of the spoons face each other. Your middle finger should curl in to hold the flared end of the handle, much like your pointer finger did with the first spoon.


This spoon should also cross the middle knuckle of your middle finger about an inch or from the backmost part of the handle., This will likely feel awkward until you get some experience and your hands become used to the sensation. Your hand should grip both spoons in a fist shape. There should be a small space between both spoons, which can be adjusted by tucking the spoons deeper or less deep into your grip.Your spoons should be parallel at all times. If your spoons wobble out of line with each other, they will not play properly.
Depending on the shape and curvature of your spoons, you may have to adjust the point the spoons cross your middle knuckle on both your pointer and middle fingers.

, The grip with which you are holding the spoons should cause the spoons to clack once against each other before silencing and returning to a parallel, slightly separated position. If there is no sound or only a faint one, your problem is most likely the distance between your spoons.


Correct insufficient gaps between your spoons by moving each deeper into your grip., Your pointer finger and your middle finger, which should be curled inward and holding the handle of your spoons, will probably get tired or cramped. This can cause the spoons to come off-center, with one or both spoons moving to one side or opposite sides. Keep your grip firm, and take a break when your inward curled fingers begin to tire.


As you practice, your hands will become more comfortable with this position and holding the spoons tightly will become easier., Your non-dominant hand, which for the purpose of this example will be referred to as the left hand, should be suspended over your leg. Hold the spoons in your right hand. Position your right hand between your left hand and leg.


Remember that your left hand should be about 5 inches or so above your leg.

, You will create a clacking, rhythmic noise with your spoons by striking them down into your leg and up into your left hand. Lightly tap your spoons several times slowly until you feel comfortable with the grip.

, You can create different tones with your spoons by striking different parts against your left hand or leg. The two main striking points are the tip, which is the rounded end of the spoon opposite the end of the handle, and the cup of the spoon, which is the hollow part.


Striking the tip of your spoons up into your left hand or down into your leg will create a lighter, brighter sound in your spoons.
Hitting the cup of your spoon up into your left hand or down into your leg will creates a stronger, more accented sound.

, When attempting to strike the tip of your spoons, you may find it easiest to hold your left hand at a slight angle, so that you can bring the tip of your spoon up into the meaty part of your hand where the thumb joins the palm.


This posture will help prevent you from hitting too much of the cup of the spoon, creating a louder clacking., Cup strikes will be flatter against your leg and left hand. Strike one cup against your leg, and then bring it up into the meaty part of your hand, where the thumb joins your palm. Both strikes should be as flat as possible to create the strong, accented tone of a cup strike., At first, you’ll probably want to do this slowly. This will ensure you keep your spoons gripped correctly while coordinating the different strikes. Repeat the earlier exercise where you accented the second and fourth beats of your rhythm, only this time use a clap strike to accent and your tip strike on beats one and two.


As you become more comfortable, try different patterns. You might try only accenting the third beat, or the first and fourth beats.
Turn on some of your favorite music and follow the beat as you play your spoons. Keep in sync with the music while alternating your strikes.

, Stretch the fingers of your left hand stiffly apart so that each finger is spread equally. Then turn your hand so that the thumb is pointed upwards and your spread fingers pointed away from your body. Slowly drag your spoons down across your outstretched fingers to create a sound like a drum roll and end by striking the spoons on your leg.Your roll should cascade from one finger to another evenly to create a metered rhythm in your roll. Keep a consistent speed as you drag your spoons down our splayed fingers.
If your roll isn’t working well, or the individual beats of the roll are indistinct, it’s likely your spoons are too close together. Pull your spoons deeper into your grip to correct this.

, The gallop roll can be overpowering, so you should only use this move sparingly to accentuate the rhythms of your spoons. First hit down on your leg. On the rebound, you should hit your left hand on the upstroke on the meaty part where your thumb meets your palm. Then cup the fingers of your hand into a C-shape, so you catch the tip of your spoons.


Your curled fingers should not move at this point. A stationary C-shape works best for beginners learning the gallop roll.
Due to the pronounced nature of this rhythm, you’ll likely only want to use this move as a flourish., Expert Spooners utilize their whole bodies while playing, both to create a more visually appealing show and to create different sounds. For example, you might create an arm roll with your spoons by drawing them against the fabric of your shirt covering your bicep and forearm., Wooden spoon in particular are recommended for mouth effects, though lightweight spoons might also work for this move. However, bouncing a metal spoon off your mouth can be painful or harmful to your teeth, so you should be cautious while trying this move out. Hold your left hand so your palm is flat before your face and:


Bounce the cup of your spoons between the corner of your mouth and the flat, palm side of your left hand.
Adjust your mouth shape as you do to create variation in the sound of the spoons. Due to individual differences in mouth shape, the sound produced by this move can vary considerably."

Cut a 5½-inch (13.97-centimeter) wide strip of black fabric.,
Drape the make over your face and feel where your eyes are.,
Define the eyes.,
Cut the eyes out.,
Try the mask on, then make any adjustments.,
Wear the Zorro mask.",How to Make a Zorro Mask1," Cut the strip down the width of the fabric. Depending on the bolt, the strip will end up either 44 to 60 inches (1.12 or 1.52 meters) long.Use a soft, non-fraying fabric, such as jersey or flannel.;
, Find the center of the mask first, then drape it over your eyes. Make sure that the center of the mask is aligned with your nose. Once you have the mask centered, lightly trace your eyes with a white dressmaker's chalk or pencil.

If you have a Styrofoam wig head, you can use that as a base instead.

, Spread the mask out on a flat surface. Use a white dressmaker's chalk or pencil to draw almond-shapes where the eyes are. Make the eyes smaller than you think they need to be; it is easier to cut away material than add it back., If you want to be more precise, cut just one eye out first, then fold the mask in half. Use the cut eye as a template for the second one., Zorro ties his mask behind his head, leaving long tails to trail down his back. The tails should reach your shoulder blades. Use a pin to mark off where you need to cut, then remove the mask and trim off the excess fabric. Make sure that you are cutting the same amount of fabric off of each end.

The mask should be wide enough to cover your forehead and nose bridge. If it is too wide, cut it narrower.
If you cut the eye openings too small, make them wider. Make sure that you don't expose your eyebrows.

, If you really want to get authentic, put a black bandana over your head first, with the bottom edge reaching the middle of your forehead. Wrap the mask around your eyes, then tie it in a knot at the back of your head.Place the mask's knot about the bandana's knot. This will help prevent it from slipping down.

Trace a mask shape onto a sheet of paper or cardstock.,
Cut the template out, then test it against your child's face.,
Use the template to cut your final mask out of black material.,
Cut a strip of black elastic.,
Pin the elastic to the sides of the mask.,
Sew the elastic down using black thread.,
Add the mask to your child's Zorro costume.",How to Make a Zorro Mask2," You can use a simple eye mask as a stencil, or you can print out a template from the internet. You can also draw a bean-shaped mask by hand. Make sure that it's long enough to cover your eyes and nose bridge, and wide enough to go from temple to temple., If you drew the mask by hand, use a pencil to mark out where the eyes should be. At this point, you should make any necessary adjustments:

If the mask is too big, cut it smaller.
If the mask is too small, trace it again, but make it larger.

, Place the template against a sheet of black felt or flannel. Trace around it using a white dressmaker's chalk or pencil. Put the template away, then cut the mask out.Don't forget to cut the eye holes out as well!

You can also use black vinyl or faux leather instead., The elastic needs to be long enough to stretch around the back of your child's head and each the sides of the mask while he or she is wearing it. Don't make the elastic too loose, however, or it won't stay on.

Plan on using 7 to 9 inches (17.78 to 2286 centimeters) of elastic.You can also cut two long strips of black ribbon or vinyl instead of elastic. Plan on making each strip 20 inches (50 centimeters) long., Turn the mask so that the back is facing you. Place each end of the elastic on each side of the mask. Make sure that the ends of the elastic are facing inwards (towards the middle of the mask) and not outwards. Pin them in place with sewing pins.

The elastic should be overlapping the mask by about ½ inch (1.27 centimeters).

, It's best if you do this on a sewing machine, but you can do it by hand as well. If you are doing this on a sewing machine, be sure to sew up and down the elastic a few times so that it is nice and secure., The elastic makes it easier for the child to take the mask on and off, without having to tie it. Best of all, if the child gets tired of wearing the mask, he or she can simply slide it down and let it dangle from their neck.

If you used ribbon or vinyl straps, you will need to tie them in a bow behind the child's head.

Acquire feathers.,
Straighten the feathers (if necessary).,
Trim the feather tips and stems.,
Attach a leather loop to each feather.,
Wrap the quills in felt.,
Add a red tuft to the end of each quill (optional).,

Add side drops (optional).,
Make and attach rosettes (optional).,
Learn where the warbonnet was used.,
Understand what the warbonnet means to its traditional wearers.,
Consider removing the warbonnet if someone asks you to.",How to Make a Warbonnet," Traditionally, the feathers most commonly used include pheasant, grouse, turkey, and eagle feathers.The right to wear these feathers, especially eagle and turkey feathers, is usually won through acts of bravery. You may prefer to use less sacred, and more commonly available, feathers available at craft stores. Long, firm feathers work best.


Tail feathers on different sides of the bird will curve in different directions. For the most symmetrical warbonnet, separate the feathers into left-curving and right-curving and arrange them on different sides of the bonnet.See the section on using a warbonnet appropriately if you are not familiar with its history.;
, If the feathers are bent or extremely curled, straighten them first to create an even, attractive warbonnet. Grip the feather on both ends, and move it over a hot lightbulb, flipping the feather over occasionally. Let the feather cool while holding it straight.Alternatively, move the feather through the steam from a kettle or clothes iron, or crimp the feather along its length with your thumbnail. Both of these methods have a higher risk of breaking the feather, so you may wish to practice on spare feathers first.Note that a slight bent to the left or right is desirable, as long as you have enough of each type to arrange them on opposite sides of the warbonnet.

, Trim each feather to a rounded butter knife shape, then smooth the veins of the feather together between your fingers so there are no stray or frayed edges.If the stems are broken, cut off the broken portion to make an even end.


If the unbroken portion of the stem is shorter than 2.5 inches (6.4 cm), insert a wooden dowel into the hollow end of the stem to make it easier to attach to the warbonnet., Cut strips of stiff, thin leather about ¼"" (6 mm) wide and 4¼"" (10.8 cm) long. Fold each strip to make a ""sandwich"" over the end of a feather quill, so the bend in the leather forms a small loop beneath the quill tip, just large enough to insert a cord through. Attach the quill to the leather strip with glue, and let the glue dry before you continue.If you want to use traditional materials, you may attach the feather to the leather by punching a hole through the feather with an awl, and tying them with a waxed cord., Cut red felt swatches approximately 1½"" (3.8 cm) wide and 4¼"" (10.8 cm) long. Wrap each swatch around the leather sheath of each quill, but leave the loop at the bottom uncovered. Tie a loop around the felt at the top and bottom of the quill stem, using strong thread, and apply a drop of glue to the knot to increase durability., In traditional Plains Indian society, red tufts were only awarded for the greatest honors, or ""grand coups."" If you wish to imitate this, glue a small, downy red feather onto the tip of each feather.

, Sometimes called a crown, the typical base for a warbonnet is a round cap made from leather or felt. You may also use a long strip of material that can wrap around the wearer's head and be laced together.If intended to be worn, rather than displayed, the cap should be cut so it fits the wearer's head, extending just above the eyebrows and halfway down the ears.


Traditionally, this skullcap or headband was made from buffalo or deerskin.You can make your own crown by curling a piece of leather or felt into a dome, cutting off the overlap, then stitching the two pieces together., Lay the feathers out along the cap or band at regular intervals. Punch holes along the rim of the cap with an awl, or cut small slits using a sharp knife. There should be two holes per feather, directly on either side of the quill stem.


The feathers of a warbonnet generally extend at minimum from one ear to the other, curving over the forehead. Feathers can also be worn individually or in small groups on the forehead, as a lesser status symbol., Attach the feathers to the cap by sewing a waxed leather cord through the holes on the cap, and through the feather loops, in the order you arranged them. Tie off the cord at each end with a strong knot, using glue to strengthen it if necessary.


You may use strong thread instead, but this is unlikely to last.

, Ideally, the feathers should stay straight and parallel to each other, or flared outward in a cone shape. If the feathers fall in other directions, you may punch additional holes in the cap, halfway between the dome and the rim. Sew a second cord around the quills at this location to keep them in place., Many warbonnets, but not all, have a beaded or quilled browband displayed on the wearer's forehead. You can buy ready-made browbands at some stores, or you can make your own by gluing colored beads onto a strip of felt or leather. To attach a browband, sew it on from the center outward with a leather cord or strong thread. Sew in holes no more than ½"" (1¼ cm) apart.


Consider purchasing the browband from a Native American tribe of the Great Plains, to support the original practitioners of the tradition.

, Another common decoration or status symbol, the side drops are two long strips of fur, one hanging from each side of the warbonnet just above the ears. Traditionally, ermine tails were used, but long strips of white rabbit fur are more easily available. Sew them on using the same cord you used for the feathers or browband.

, The term ""rosette"" refers to any circular decoration on the side of the warbonnet. These may be made from beads, fur, or even additional feathers tied in a circular position. They are usually attached using additional leather cords, and may cover up the attachment points for the side drops.

, Only members of the Native American tribes in the Great Plains region traditionally wear the warbonnet. Films and tourist shows in the United States often dressed up other Native Americans or even white actors in fake warbonnet costumes, and many people now incorrectly associate it with native Americans across the New World.


Examples of tribes that use the warbonnet include the Sioux, Crow, Blackfeet, Cheyenne, and Plains Cree., In the original tribes that invented the warbonnet, only male chiefs and warriors wear them. They were, and still are, presented as a great honor and reserved mostly for formal ceremonies. Much like a military uniform, a crown, or other status symbols, people in these cultures do not make and wear warbonnets for fun, or without earning the right to wear them.

, If you are not wearing a warbonnet as part of a ceremony organized by a Great Plains tribe, many members of those tribes may not appreciate you wearing the warbonnet. Even Native Americans of other tribes may ask you to remove it, as they or their relatives may have been forced to wear it for tourism purposes, or stereotyped and bullied with references to the warbonnet. Even if you do not agree with another person's interpretation, removing the warbonnet in his presence demonstrates respect and politeness.


The eagle feather is sometimes considered a mark of special honor, and using one of these in a warbonnet may cause additional offense. Many tribes have additional sacred feathers, such as owl feathers, although these are not usually used in warbonnets.

Scrolls were used for centuries in countries like China, Egypt, and Greece. Look at different scrolls online and see if any inspire you!Decide whether you want your scroll to look modern or ancient. If you choose to go for an ancient look, consider ageing your paper.
Your scroll doesn’t have to look like the ones you see online! You can make a completely unique scroll, or combine features you like from many different scrolls.;
, Pick the paper you want to use for your scroll. You can use colorful construction paper, drawing paper, or plain printer paper. All of these can be aged later by soaking them in tea or coffee.

Brown paper bags work if you want your paper to look aged, but don’t want to go through the process of staining it yourself. Just cut a rectangle out of the bag.You can tape multiple pieces of paper together to make an extra-long scroll, if you want. Feel free to mix and match different colors, but make sure each piece of paper is the same size.If you’re feeling really fancy, try using papyrus like the ancient Egyptians did!, Scrolls were traditionally used as decorations, or to document information and tell stories.Think about what you want to write or draw on your scroll. You can do both if you want!

If you want to make an Egyptian inspired scroll, consider including some hieroglyphics, the ancient Egyptian form of writing.You can also draw a treasure map, or write a story about one of your favorite experiences. Get creative!
If you want to include typed text on your scroll, print it onto your paper now. You won’t be able to do it after you age your paper., Crumpling your paper makes it look wrinkled and aged. Spray your paper with a little water and crumple it into a ball. Then, smooth it out again. Crumple it a few more times for a more wrinkled appearance.You can iron your paper very lightly if you want it extra flat.
Stop here if you like the way it looks! If you want to stain your paper to make it look even older, keep going.
If you are using a brown paper bag, you don’t need to stain it.

, You can age your paper by soaking it in either coffee or tea. Pick whichever one is most convenient for you, and brew enough to cover the sheet you want to age. If you are younger, ask a parent for help.You can brew coffee in a coffee machine, or use instant coffee. The darker the coffee, the better.To brew a strong cup of tea, soak at least three tea bags in a cup of hot water.Be sure to brew extra if you are aging multiple sheets.

, Place the paper in a large pan, and apply the coffee or tea to using a method of your choice. You can dab it on with a sponge, paint it on with a paint brush, or dip your paper in the mixture until your achieve your desired color. Make sure the coffee or tea is not too hot.








Try using your teabag as an applicator. Wipe the wet teabag all over paper, squeezing as you go until you achieve the color you want.The paper will look a little darker when it’s dry, so stop applying the coffee or tea when it’s a couple shades lighter than you want it.Add grains of instant coffee or flecks of tea to your paper for extra texture.

, Hang the paper to dry using clothespins. If it’s nice out, hang it outside. You can also lay it flat on a clean surface to dry, but beware of staining.








If your paper turns out too light, repeat the staining process until you achieve the shade you want.
Weigh the dried paper down with a book or other heavy object if you want it flatter., You may want to make your paper look even older by distressing the edges. You can burn the edges by lighting a match over a safe, non-flammable surface and waving it back and forth over the edges. Continue until you achieve the desired look, shaking and brushing away burnt edges. Alternatively, you can rip the edges with your fingers.








Practice distressing the edges on a few scrap sheets of paper before attempting on your scroll paper. You don’t want to tear or burn away too much of the edges!
You can also burn the edges using lemon or lime juice and a heat gun. Apply a little juice to the edges of the paper, then heat with the heat gun until you get the desired effect., Now, it’s time to write or draw on your scroll! A black pen works best, especially for delicate aged paper or paper bags. Feel free to use crayons or colored pencils if you want your scroll to be colorful!








Be careful when using paints or heavy markers, especially if you are using a paper bag. These can bleed through more delicate papers.
Allow the ink to dry completely before moving on to the next step. After all, you don’t want to smear your writing or drawings!

, Dowels are the sticks you sometimes see at the end of scrolls that make them easier to roll and unroll. You can purchase craft sticks from your local craft store to make your dowels. Cut them to the width of your paper. You will need two dowels, one for each end. Alternatively, you can use chopsticks.Decorate the ends of your dowels using ribbon or dowel caps, which can be purchased at your local craft store. Secure your decorations with hot glue.

, Place one dowel on the right end of your scroll, another on the left. Make sure the side with the writing is facing up. Wrap the edge of the paper inward around each dowel, so that the dowel is covered. Secure the dowel with hot glue or tape.








, After the glue has dried, roll each side of the scroll around its dowel so that the two sides meet in the middle. If you aren’t using dowels, simply roll up your scroll from one end to the other, hot-dog style, making sure the writing is on the inside.








, Select a piece of string, yarn, or ribbon, and tie it around your scroll. This is optional, but it can add a nice touch while keeping your scroll secure."

Continue practicing.",How to Play the Accordion," There are variety of different accordions out there, but some are more well-suited for beginners than others. The more information you gather the better equipped you will be to successfully learn to play the accordion. Here is the most suitable option for beginners:


Piano Accordions. These are the most popular kinds, with the power of a regular piano in a highly portable size. They have between 25 and 45 piano style treble keys on the right hand. On the left, they are equipped with a bass-chord keyboard. This accordion system is called the stradella, and typically has 120 brass buttons.;
, Your accordion is composed of several parts, all crucial to the accordion's sounds:


Melody Keys. These are buttons on the keyboard part of the instrument.
Bellows. These are the folds on the instrument that allow it to expand and contract.
Harmonic, Base, Air Valve. These buttons provide air to escape, adjusting the tone of sound.
Right Hand Strap. This is the main strap of the instrument that allows you to secure it onto your chest.

, Children and teens or adults will need to start off with different sizes due to the difference in hand and general body size.


Children should start with the lowest number of bass buttons, 12 bass and 25 treble keys.
Teens and adults should start with a 48 bass accordion. This amounts to 48 bass and 26 treble keys.
The 48 bass Piano Accordion is very light weight, and easy to use and handle. Plus, you can play lots of different music on it, which will make you want to hang on to it even if you outgrow it.

, When you begin handling your instrument in the next section of the article, your left arm will move horizontally and vertically, while your right hand will only move vertically. For now, just hold it and see how comfortable or uncomfortable it is.

, Some people prefer to stand while playing and others like to sit with their instrument. All that matters is your sense of comfort and confidence, so try out a few different positions until you feel at ease.

, Your body posture is very important when playing this instrument and slouching will cause you to be inaccurate in your balance and consequently in your performance.

, The accordion is relatively large and requires a little bit of familiarity when holding it. Being able to maintain proper balance is crucial. The more evenly balanced you manage to keep the accordion's weight, the better you'll be able to play because of the added control. And the more control you have, the less uncomfortable the weight will feel.

, Slip your left arm under the strap of the instrument. You'll want to hold it as if you were putting on a backpack on your chest. The piano keys should be to your right and your left hand goes underneath the bass strap - the small strap on the left side of the instrument.


Note that there is usually a thumb wheel on the left side to adjust the strap.
Make sure that your accordion fits tightly enough not to move at all while you move.

, An additional strap can be very useful. The back strap keeps the shoulder straps together so that the accordion doesn't move.


Note that if the back strap is too far down it alleviates weight from the shoulders, making the straps loose on top. This, in turn, causes your straps to move and slide.
Keep the back strap higher up, or secure it diagonally.
Remember that when the straps stay in place, so does your instrument.

, The buckles can be found on the top and bottom of the instrument. Take care not to push or pull the accordion yet.

, Don't bend your right wrist while keeping your elbow close to your side. It'll be a bit awkward at the beginning but you'll be able to achieve better accuracy as your hand's circulation won't be impeded.


This applies the right arm only.

, You right hand should be free and resting above the piano keyboard.

, Press the button down softly, and pull your instrument with your left arm. You'll hear a hissing noise as the air goes into the accordion and the bellows open.


Note that it's important to use this button when you open and close the bellows while they're moving.
Don't press down on the keyboard while you're opening and closing the bellows.

, No matter how many bass buttons your accordion has, you'll soon notice that they produce the chords, or vamps, automatically. This is due to the accordion's mechanism.


The term chord refers to the sound produced by a group of notes played together.
Keep the bass buttons pressed for only a short time. Imagine they were on fire, and take your finger off quickly.

, This will be quite difficult at first, but do your best not to look at where your fingers go, or need to go.

, If your accordion is a larger model, then look for the note C in the second row.

, For now, your only concern should be getting comfortable with your instrument, and focusing on the first two rows of bass buttons.


Regardless of how many bass rows your accordion has, you'll only be looking at the first two rows.

, Then, tuck your thumb under your index finger and push on the button right below the note C. This button will be slightly off center, but right below the button that your index finger is pressing.

, Then, press the two buttons alternately to produce a chord. You'll generate a sort of of oom-pah sound.


Try to pull the bellows smoothly for the best sound effect.

, The beat for the Waltz goes 1, 2, 3--1, 2, 3. Play the C note on the the first beat, and push the button right below the C on the second and third beat.

, This is how you can generate a simply accompaniment, or vamp.

, Now try to pull the bellows in as you alternately press the four buttons you just learned. Repeat this several times to practice.

, Let's try another easy scale exercise that will help you produce your first, controlled sound sequence:


Expand the instrument's bellows.
Softly and evenly push it back together, and hold the 1st key down.
Keep pressing the note key while you change directions by pulling the instrument in opposite directions.
Go to the next key, push in and pull apart.
Jump to the next key, and you have now played Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La.

, This exercise has two chords, and you can leave your fingers on the keyboard. Place your thumb on the C, and pinky on the G: begin with the third finger on the E.

, Coordination might seem a little difficult at first, so it's important that you become very familiar with the necessary movements. Repeat the above exercise until you feel confident and can move on to more advanced practices.

Set up your snare drum.,
Practice different matched grips.,
Try a traditional grip for soft sound and jazz.,
Use correct posture.,
Practice striking the drums.",How to Play the Snare Drum1," If you want to play an instrument, you need to understand how to set it up safely. This way, you can follow guidelines and practice efficiently.


The snare drum is a small, circular drum that can be placed on a metallic stand. Your stand will usually have a base, comprised of three to four moveable legs. Spread the legs wide enough to create a stable base for the drum. The stand should not be wiggling at all as you begin to fit the snare drum into it.On the top of your case, there is a metallic chamber where you secure your snare drum. This called the basket. Gently fit your drum into the basket, making sure the drum stays relatively still in response to pressure and movement.The snare drum should be at about waist level. If your snare drum is too high or too low, adjust the stand's height accordingly. Your snare drum should tilt towards you slightly. If you feel uncomfortable or awkward as you begin playing, you can tweak how the drum is tilted for your personal comfort.Wing nuts are screws found on your snare drum stand, which have large, wing-like bolts. Make sure you go through and tighten all the wing nuts slightly each time you begin playing your snare drum.;
, Depending on the type of drumming you're doing, you grip your sticks differently. Before you begin to play the snare drum, spend some time familiarizing yourself with different grips. In a matched grip, common with beginners, you hold both drumsticks in the same way. This is a standard type of grip for most drumming techniques. There are three ways to use a matched grip.


In a Germanium grip, common in rock drumming, find the balance point or fulcrum point of your drumsticks. Grip your drum with your thumb and index finger here, placing your remaining fingers at the bottom of the drum stick. Keep your elbows out and bend the drum sticks at a 90 degree angle pointing towards the snare drum. Your palms should be pointing down.
The American grip is the same as the Germanium grip in terms of how you hold the drumsticks. However, the angle is slightly different. Let your arms fall down and point the drumsticks at a 45 degree angle pointing to the snare drum, once again keeping your palms down. Many people find the American grip comfortable, so it's popular for drumming beginners.The third kind of matched grip is the French grip. You hold the drumsticks close together and almost parallel. You also keep your palms up when holding your sticks. This might not be the best hold for beginners. While it allows for quicker movements, it can be hard to maintain control over drum strokes., A traditional grip is most common in jazz drumming. Hold the stick with your palm up, placing the balance point of your stick in the pocket created between your thumb and index finger. Keep your index and middle finger on top of the stick and your pinky and ring finger on the bottom of your stick. As you don't get as much power out of strokes with this grip, use it for softer styles and jazz., Your posture is important when it comes to drumming. You will not play as effectively without good posture and you can also cause yourself back pain. Learn correct posture before you begin playing the snare drum.


Keep your legs slightly apart when you stand and hold your back straight. Keep your arms at your sides. Allow them to rest in a position that's comfortable to you.Once again, the drum should be at waist level. Adjust the stand if it's too high or too low. Keep your body relaxed, especially your shoulders, hands, and arms., To begin, just experiment with drum strokes. Before learning specific moves or techniques, make sure you know how to use your drumsticks correctly.


The end of a drumstick is referred to as the bead. The bead of a drumstick should move up and down in a straight line as you play.Try your best to hit the same part of the drum with each beat. This can take some practice as it's hard to have full control over the movement of your drumsticks when you're first starting out.The sticks should bounce off of the drums. To achieve a bouncing effect, keep your fingers, hands, and arms relaxed.Practice just beating on the drum freely until you feel like you have some control over the drumsticks. Then, you can start learning some moves.

The full stroke means you hold the drums, using your preferred grip, in a slightly upright position. That is, your drumsticks will be pointing upward towards the ceiling. When you're using a full stroke, your drumsticks will begin in the upright position at the start of a beat and return to the upright position at the end of a beat.A down stroke is a slight variation of a full stroke. Your drum sticks start in the upright position. However, at the end of a beat they should be pointed downward slightly towards your snare drum.In a tap stroke, at the beginning of the beat your drumsticks are in the downward position. At the end of the beat, they return to the downward position.In an up stroke, your drumsticks are in the downward position at the beginning of a beat. By the end of the beat, they're in the upright position.When reading music, drum parts will usually indicate which strokes you are using. F stands for full stroke, D stands for down stroke, T stands for tap stroke, and U stands for upstroke., The single strike roll is an important drum rudiment. If you want to learn how to play the snare drum, you'll need to know a basic single strike roll. Practicing a single stroke roll can be a great introduction to basic drumming. It will help you get a feel of your drumsticks and teach you how to control them.


A drum roll is a simple move in which you quickly alternate between playing with your left and right hand. You start with your dominant hand. For example, if you're right-handed you would play right, then left, then right, then left, and so on. If you're left-handed, play left, then right, then left, then right, and so on.Start off slow. Just aim to have good control of your drumsticks. Make sure they rise and fall in a straight line and land on the same point on the drum each time. Do not pay attention to timing as you begin practicing. Just focus on going from left to right or from right to left while maintaining control of your drumsticks.Once you feel in control, begin to incorporate timing. Make sure the beats are even. That is, make sure you spend equal time on each beat. Try to challenge yourself. Increase you speed with each practice session, trying to remain in control of your drumsticks while keeping an even tempo as speed increases., A double stroke roll is a slight variation on the single stroke roll. Like the single stroke roll, it can be used to get a feel for your drumsticks. It's another basic snare drum rudiment to master as you're starting off.


In the double stroke roll, you use two strikes per hand instead of one. This creates a faster-paced, more intense tempo. Once again, lead with your dominant hand. If you're right-handed, play right, right, left, left, right, right, left, left, and so on. If you're left-handed, play left, left, right, right, left, left, right, right, and so on.Your drum sticks should bounce naturally when you keep your wrist relaxed. Hit the drum and allow the stick to bounce twice. Then, stop movement in your wrist and fingers and pull the drum stick upward. Repeat on the other side.Start off slow. When mastering any new technique on the snare drum, you'll need time to gain control. Make sure you're moving your drum sticks in a straight line. Make sure the beads of the sticks hit the same spot on the drum for each beat. Practice as long as it takes to feel in control.As you feel more comfortable controlling the drum sticks, move up to a faster pace. Eventually, you should be able to do a quick-paced double and single roll., A buzz roll is a slightly more advanced drum roll. Similar to the double stroke roll, a buzz roll uses a more relaxed grip to allow more fluid movements.


Learn the buzz roll one hand at a time. Start with whichever hand you prefer. Use your index finger and thumb primarily to guide the drum stick. This hold can take a bit of practice before it feels secure.Say you're starting with your left hand. Use your left hand to strike the snare drum. Allow the drumstick to bounce freely, allowing it to continue bouncing until movement stop naturally. Do not, as you did with the double roll, use your wrist to stop the drumstick. Repeat this with your left hand.Keep going back and forth with your hands. As you go, increase the tempo slightly. Minimize time between striking your left drumstick and striking your right drumstick. The buzz roll is meant to build intensity and excitement over time., As you practice basic drum moves, remember to follow the proper technique. You'll need to keep technique in mind to practice efficiently.


Keep your posture in mind. Remember to relax your body, keep your legs apart, and make sure the drum is at waist level.
Use the proper grip. The grip, as outlined, depends heavily on the type of music and your level of proficiency. Matched grips are best when you're starting off drumming as they allow for the most control. However, if you're going into jazz drumming specifically use the traditional grip.
It's very important to keep your hands relaxed. Gripping too hard on a drumstick does not provide more control. It can also cause tension in your hands, leading to fatigue and cramping. Even if you feel a loss of control, try to remember not to hold too hard on your drumsticks., Solid finger technique is what allows you to maneuver your drumsticks efficiently. As you move through the basics of drumming, take a moment to familiarize yourself with basic finger techniques.


To gain greater control over your drumsticks, practice moving the sticks with only your fingers. Keep your wrists and arms completely still as you move your drumsticks up and down. Do some of the basic moves we have outlined, like a single roll, double roll, and buzz roll. As you practice these moves, only use your fingers to move your drumsticks.Keep your hands loose as you play. Do not stress out about playing fast. You can increase tempo later on, when you feel more in control of your drumsticks.With finger technique, you should actually train your weaker hand first. This way, you're more likely to spend adequate time training your less dominant hand. If you're right-handed, start with your left hand. If you're left-handed, start with your right hand."

Listen to the cues of your band.,
Practice with a metronome.,
Put timing first.",How to Play the Snare Drum3," If you're working with a band, learn to work as a team. Timing is vital if you want to be a good drummer. Pay attention to the band's beat to determine the tempo you should use.


Drummers provide the backbone of rhythm in a song. The underlying beat of a song is usually defined by a drum. You need to be able to speed up and slow down when necessary and play in the tempo required by the piece you're performing.
Review the songs you're playing ahead of time to get a sense of when to speed up and when to slow down. Practice playing along to a recording before going to band practice, keeping an eye on your time.Be open to criticism. Teamwork is important in a band or orchestra. If your bandmates or conductor tell you that you're playing too fast or too slow, accept this as constructive criticism. Try to ask them what you can do to play at a more even tempo.If you feel you're playing too slow or too fast, listen to the tempo of the other instruments and players. Try to match that tempo as you work your drum beats., A metronome is a small handheld device that keeps beats. All drummers need to start off practicing with a metronome if they want to learn to keep time. You can set a metronome to whatever tempo you want and try to hit your drum with the beats it keeps.


As you practice with a metronome, pay attention to when you start slipping. For some drummers, keeping beat is difficult towards the beginning of a song. It may take them a few minutes to get into the swing. However, for other drummers the end of the song is where they tire down and begin to slip. If you know your weak spots, you'll be able to know when to be extra vigilant during performances.Ask your band or conductor if you can keep a metronome going into practice. For some drummers, having the clicking tempo in their head keeps them focused. You may find using a metronome while playing with others is tremendously helpful., If your beats are not in time, they will sound off to the audience. Even if other aspects of your technique are solid, bad timing interferes with other musicians and creates confusion for the audience. As you begin moving past the basics of the snare drum and playing with others, prioritize learning to keep time. Practice with a metronome each night and ask your bandmates and conductors for constructive feedback."
"
Rest your thumbs.,
Practice each day.,
Record yourself.,
Consider lessons.",How to Play the Snare Drum4," Your thumbs tend to cramp and become sore if you play the drums a lot.Try to rest your thumbs between performances and practice. Do not engage in activities, like texting and typing, that require you to use your thumbs. Try gently massaging the skin around your thumbs or soaking them in warm water.

, There's no magic trick to getting better at a musical instrument. You simply need to practice each day. The only way to become proficient in playing the snare drum is to put in the necessary work.


Practice should be part of your daily routine. Just as you brush your teeth and shower in the morning, practicing your snare drum should be a daily priority. Take half an hour to a hour each day to practice.
Schedule practice time into your weekly routine. If you get done with school or work around 3 o'clock each day, see if you can schedule practice time around 4 o'clock. You can adjust this schedule on weekends or if there are extenuating circumstances.
Make sure you're conscientious of others when practicing. Drums can be loud. If you're playing on a second story, make sure you put down carpeting or a rug under your drums to muffle the sound. Try not to practice too late at night or too early in the day.

, Keep a record of yourself practicing. You can listen to yourself playing afterwards and check for your strengths and weaknesses. You do not need extensive equipment to record yourself as your primary goal is to gauge your own proficiency. You can use your laptop or phone to record practice sessions., Lessons can be a great way to increase your proficiency. There are many different techniques and styles involved in playing the snare drum. After learning some basics, consider seeing a professional instructor. He or she will be able to observe you playing and offer specific feedback based on your style.


If money is an issue, consider buying a book on the snare drum. While this is not the same as one-on-one instruction, it could provide some additional insight on technique and style.

Begin by varying the length of the articulation.,
Learn the different notations of ornaments and what they represent.",How to Play Articulations and Ornaments," Do this by playing four quarter notes in succession, all the same length. For example: play four notes long, making them sound like they almost run together, and then play four notes that are so short they sound like eighth notes instead of quarters. Here are descriptions of common articulations that affect note length:




 

Staccato: Staccato notes are short and detached. When played properly, they often make a note value sound half as short. Unlike accents, staccato notes should not be played heavily. They are light, and usually playful.






Tenuto/Legato: Tenuto notes are to be held for their full value. They often sound almost run together. Tenuto can also mean slightly louder or with weight.






Slurs: A slur indicates that the notes it embraces are to be played without separation. This implies legato articulation, and in music for bowed string instruments, it also indicates the notes should be played in one bow; and in music for wind instruments, that the notes should be played without using the tongue to re-articulate each note.;
, You may wish to play a piece without and then with ornaments.

Trills: A trill is a rapid alternation between an indicated note and the one above. Usually, if the music containing the trill was written before 1800 the trill is played by starting a note above the written note. If the music was written after 1800 then the trill is usually played by starting on the note written and going up to the note above. (This will most likely be noted in the music piece. If not assume the latter rule applies.)


 Both measures contain trills




 These notes represent how the trill should be played.



Mordents: The mordent is thought of as a rapid single alternation between an indicated note, the note above or below, and the indicated note again. The upper mordent (goes to note above) is indicated by a short squiggle (which may also indicate a trill); the lower mordent (goes to the note below) is the same with a short vertical line through it.


 From left to right, upper then lower mordents




 These notes represent how the mordents should be played.








Turns: A turn is a short figure consisting of the note above the one indicated, the note itself, the note below the one indicated, and the note itself again. It is marked by a mirrored S-shape lying on its side above the staff.






Grace notes: A grace note is indicated by printing a note that is much smaller than a regular note. Grace notes occur as notes of short duration before the sounding of the relatively longer-lasting note which immediately follows them. A slash through the note indicates it should be very short.






Glissando: A glissando is a slide from one note to another (any notes between the two in step order), signified by a wavy line connecting the two notes.

Learn the proper grip for holding a tambourine.,
Avoid some of the common mistakes in tambourine grip.",How to Play a Tambourine1," A tambourine should be held in your non-dominant hand. Wrap your four fingers underneath the frame of the instrument and rest your thumb lightly against the head (if your tambourine has no head, rest your thumb across the top edge of the frame). Angle the head of the tambourine towards your dominant hand so that you have ample room to strike the head. Do not apply more pressure to the head with your non-dominant hand than necessary, as this will mute the sound.;
, Many tambourines have a mounting hole drilled in the frame; avoid placing your finger through this hole during play. This can mute the instrument's sound and make it difficult to pick it up and put it down without making unwanted noise. Also avoid clutching the tambourine any tighter than is required to keep it steady; this can lead to fatigue.

"
"
Apply the basic technique for striking a tambourine.,
Adjust your technique to improve the instrument's tone.,
Vary your technique as the setting requires.",How to Play a Tambourine2," Traditionally, the tambourine head should be struck with the tips of your fingers. Hold your four fingers together and quickly strike the head at a location about a third of the distance towards the center of the head from the frame. Striking in the center of the head will produce a muddled tone, as the head will not be able to resonate fully.

, Ideally, when striking the tambourine, you should hear both a short jingling from the zills and a short resonance from the head. Adjust your striking force and location until the instrument's tone is to your liking.

, In orchestral settings, it is best not to deviate from this technique. However, in less formal applications such as rock or pop music, you have enormous latitude in choosing a striking technique. For instance, you can strike the tambourine head with your entire palm for a fuller sound.

"

Understand when a shake roll is best used.,
Apply the technique for executing a shake roll.,
Learn how to vary your dynamic level.",How to Play a Tambourine3," When music calls for sustained sound from the tambourine rather than for individual strokes, you can play a shake roll. This sound is generated by simply shaking the tambourine continuously to keep the zils jingling.

, To play a shake roll, rotate the wrist of your holding hand back and forth at a constant, continuous speed. This motion should always be generated from your wrist. Using your elbow or entire arm to shake the instrument can lead to poor tone and fatigue.

, Shake rolls are excellent for long, sustained rolls, especially when crescendos or diminuendos are called for. To vary your dynamic level, simply vary the speed and intensity of your wrist's motion. Shaking the tambourine harder and faster will produce a louder tone, and a softer motion will produce a quieter tone.

"
"
Familiarize yourself with the thumb roll.,
Learn the technique for playing a thumb roll.,
Understand the ideal applications of the thumb roll.",How to Play a Tambourine4," A thumb roll is an alternative to the shake roll that is played by rubbing your thumb across the surface of the tambourine. it is generally more difficult to execute, but provides a more uniform tone than a shake roll.

, To play a thumb roll, press the tips of your four fingers against your palm, leaving your thumb extended. Press your thumb firmly into the head of the tambourine and drag it across the head in a circular motion. The friction between your thumb and the head will cause the zils to jingle continuously.

, Thumb rolls are ideal for short rolls, as they can be more difficult to sustain properly than shake rolls. Thumb rolls can also be substituted for individual strokes in very fast passages.

Strike the tambourine with a stick or mallet as necessary.,
Experiment with different tones using sticks and mallets.",How to Play a Tambourine5," Often in a multi-percussion setup, it will be necessary to mount a tambourine to a stand in order to free your hands for playing other instruments. In this case, it is acceptable to play the instrument with either a stick or a mallet. The tambourine can be struck directly on the head or on the top edge of the frame.

, If you are interested in exploring the tonal possibilities of the tambourine, varying your striking implement is helpful. For instance, a soft yarn marimba mallet will produce a much more subdued tone than a drumstick or glockenspiel mallet.

Choose the note you are going to play.,
Decide which finger you want to use.,
Bring the finger to the string and grab it with the meat of your finger.,
Pull your finger away.",How to Play Pizzicato1," You can pizzicato any note on the fingerboard, or even an open string. Make sure you know which one you are going to play before you start.;
,


You have two fingers on your right hand you can use for pizzicato: your first finger and your middle finger. The first finger is a good choice because you can still hold the bow easily if you do not have time to put it down. However, many string players have found that using the middle finger produces a warmer, richer sound.
You can also use your left hand for pizzicato, but very rarely. The only times you would ever use left hand pizzicato would be if it was written in the music or if the piece is moving fast and you need more time to bring the bow back up. To do this, find the note that you are going to play and pizz with a sideswipe with the finger in front of it. For example, if you are on the D string and you have to play an E, place your first finger in the E spot and pizz with your second finger. If you are on the D string and you have to play an A however, shift up to third position and pluck with your third finger.

, You should never use your nails when performing pizzicato. If you can't grab the string with just the meat of your finger, then it may be time to trim your nails.

, You should pull your finger away as soon as you pizz. If the piece is moving slowly, you can follow through and even take your hand away slightly. However, most pieces require you to (gently!) wedge your thumb between the fingerboard and the body and come up just a short amount between plucks.

This article is written for people with experience playing the fretted bass.,
Get one with lines.,
Play ON the lines, not behind them.,
Learn to slide.,
Turn up.,
Learn what works.",How to Play a Fretless Bass," If you've never played bass before, starting on a fretted might be a good idea, since they're generally easier.;
, Some fretless basses come with lines on the neck where the frets would be, while others have no lines at all. While some people think lined fretless basses don't look as cool (and you will get people saying ""That's a fretless? What are those lines then?), going from a fretted bass to an unlined fretless is a great way to play lots of very wrong notes. Besides, Jaco Pastorius played a lined fretless, and he's the greatest fretless player of all time. If you really don't want visible lines on the neck, you can get ones that have the lines only on the side of the neck, though these are harder to use.

, The biggest mistake that people make when using a fretless for the first time is putting their fingers where they would for a fretted bass, between the lines. This can produce notes that are a quarter tone or more off from the note you intend to play. On a fretless bass, you need to put your finger precisely where the fret would be- so if I'm trying to play a C on the A string, I put my finger exactly on the third line, not between the second and third lines. Always watch your fingers when they're playing so that you're playing exactly the right note.

, One of the best things about fretless is that you can slide perfectly smoothly between any two notes on a string, getting all the intermediate tones as well. Sliding on Fretless sounds fantastic, and can be used as the basis of terrific bass solos. Play around with slides, and listen to the different tones you get -- a quick slide has a sharper sound, while a slow slide is very smooth and resonant. Just be very careful that you stop exactly on the right line and get there on the right beat.

, Fretless basses are, on average, quieter than fretted ones, so you'll need to turn your amp or volume pots up higher to get the same amount of volume. Even at high levels, though, the type of sound a fretless produces isn't going to blast anyone out of their seat, so you need to...

, It's not just the sliding, fretless basses have a very different tone from fretted basses. They sound very warm, fluid, and smooth, and are conducive to beautiful sounding melodies, but they lack the hard, defined punch of a fretted bass, and slapping and popping will sound very different without a metal fret for the strings to bounce off of. On the other hand, you can produce sounds that you simply can't with a fretted bass- Jaco, for example, had a very horn-like tone. Overall, try to think more melodically, hold notes out and think less about pounding pedal tones. Playing fast and loud can work very well --Steve Digiorgio made a career out of playing Death Metal on fretless and it worked beautifully-- and in fact fretless is ultimately easier to play fast once you get good with it, but you need to respect your instrument and what it can do.

Determine rhythm.",How to Play Mandolin," The mandolin has been around for centuries, and during that time, different styles have developed. Choose the right mandolin to match your preferences.


The three main types are Neapolitan, A-style, and F-style.
Neapolitan types are used for classical music.
A-style types are used for bluegrass, Irish, classical, and rock music.
F-style types are used for bluegrass. Since F-style mandolins are expensive and ornate, they are less practical for beginners.;
, The only real way to find the right pick is to experiment with different weight picks until you find one that feels comfortable in your hands.


Generally, light to medium picks are used for mandolin playing, but this is not a strict rule.

, One of the most effective ways to get used to the timing and overall sounds of the mandolin is to play along with audio recordings of professional mandolin music.


Focus on the mandolin styles you're most interested in, but listen to the mandolin play a variety of different songs and genres for more well-rounded knowledge.
Make sure that you mix older mandolin music in with newer mandolin music. Newer techniques and styles are built from older ones, and understanding the older ones will make it easier to learn the newer styles.
When you are learning a new song, embed that song firmly in your mind by listening to it repetitively. There will be room to develop your own personal twist later, but for now, you need to know the basic tune thoroughly enough to know how it is supposed to sound when played correctly.

, You need to hold the mandolin on your lap. The neck of the mandolin should point upward and diagonally toward your non-dominant side.


Do not press the mandolin against your torso too securely since doing so can deaden the sound.
The forearm connected to your dominant hand should be horizontal and the arm should be bent at the elbow.

, Your left hand (or non-dominant hand) will fret individual chords. Your right hand (or dominant hand) will pluck the strings as you play notes.The fingers of your non-dominant hand will press down on the frets along the neck of the mandolin for each chord. Your thumb should be at the top of the neck, and the fingers should come up from the bottom.
You should hold the pick in lightly yet firmly in between your thumb and first finger of your dominant hand. The pick should rest on the first finger along the thumb side, in between the first joint and the tip. The pointed edge of the pick should face out.

, You need to make sure that the strings of the mandolin are properly tuned before you can begin playing it.


The strings of a mandolin are arranged in pairs. Both strings in each pair will be tuned to the same note.
The string pairs are traditionally tuned from low to high, ranging from G-D-A-E. The highest string pair, E, should be closest to the floor.
Use an electric tuner for the best, most accurate results. If you do not have an electric tuner, however, you can use another instrument to help you tune the strings correctly.

, A chord refers to a combination or family of musical tones. A note is a certain musical tone played within a chord.


Chords are controlled by your non-dominant hand.
Notes are controlled by your dominant hand and your non-dominant hand.
Both should be indicated on the musical score or tablature you intend to practice.

, Do not hold the strings down at the frets constantly since doing so will quickly wear you out. Instead, ""chop"" the frets before strumming the string.Rest your fingers on the chord before you play it.
Immediately before the pick strikes the string, depress the string at the fret.
As soon as the pick leaves, release the strings.
The timing of your press-and-release will vary the way the instrument sounds, so you'll need to practice to find a timing—and by extension, a sound—that works for you.

, This is one of the three major chords you'll need to learn to play most mandolin songs.


Your index finger should be in the top fret on the string second closest to your palm.
Your middle finger should be in the second fret on the string closest to your palm.
Your ring finger should be in the fourth fret on the string second furthest from your palm.
Your pinky finger should be in the sixth fret on the string furthest from your palm.

, This is another of the three major chords you'll need to master.


Your index finger should be in the top fret on the string closest to your palm.
Your middle finger should be in the third fret on the string second furthest from your palm.
Your ring finger should be in the fourth fret on the string second closest to your palm.
Your pinky finger should be in the sixth fret on the string furthest from your palm.

, This is the final of the three major chords you must learn if you want to play the mandolin.


Your index finger should be in the second fret on the string second furthest from your palm.
Your middle finger should be in the third fret on the string second closest to your palm.
Your ring finger should be in the fifth fret on the string furthest from your palm.
Your pinky finger should not be on the mandolin at all.

, The easiest way for most beginners is to read music from a tablature.


If you know how to read music the traditional way (on a stave), you could use that option. It can be difficult to learn initially, however, which is why beginners who don't know it already usually don't rely on the stave.
If you have an exceptionally good ear, you could also learn to play the mandolin simply by ear.

,


The top line represents the highest note. It does not necessarily represent the top string.
To gain better perspective, turn the mandolin on its side so that the strings are facing up and the back runs parallel to the floor. When you look down and toward the side of the mandolin, you should notice that the highest string is the one which is tuned to the highest note. This highest string is the top line of the tablature.
For standard G-D-A-E tuning, the bottom line is G, the second to bottom is D, the third to bottom is A, and the highest is E. Tablatures written for a different tuning should be marked as such.
Usually, the tablature will look something like this:

E--||----------------
A--||----------------
D--||----------------
G--||----------------



, Notes are designated by numbers. The absence of a number indicates that no string is to be played.


When you see a 0, it signifies an open string.
Any other number will tell you which fret to press the string down in. For instance, a ""1"" is your top fret, ""2"" is the second fret, ""3"" is the third fret, ""4"" is the fourth fret, ""5"" is the fifth fret, and ""6"" is the sixth fret.

, By looking at the fret number and the string line, you can determine how to play the note.


For example, a ""2"" placed on the third line indicates that you should hold the second fret and play on the third highest pitched string (usually ""D"").
In tablature form, that would look something like:

E--||--------------------
A--||--------------------
D--||---------2----------
G--||--------------------



, Chords are indicated by placing numbers on top of one another.


For example, C-major would look like:

E--||--0--------------
A--||--3--------------
D--||--2--------------
G--||--0--------------


Tablature will not tell you which finger to use for each fret, however. For that, you must practice the chord positions separately, as indicated previously.

, The duration of each note is indicated by how much horizontal spacing is left in between notes.


Actual notes (whole notes, half notes, quarter notes, eighth notes) are not indicated on the tablature. Rhythm is based entirely on the way notes and their durations are related to each other on the tablature.
Numbers placed closely together indicate shorter notes. Wider spacing indicates longer notes.
Numbers spaced evenly apart should last the same length of time. When there is a wider space, the note indicated by the number before it should last for a relatively longer time (a gap twice as wide means the note is twice as long, etc.). The same can be said for notes followed by smaller spaces (a gap half as wide means the note is half as long, etc.).

, Since you have a sweet potato ocarina (named after its shape), you hold it by placing your thumbs on the back holes and putting each of your fingers on the front holes. Your left hand should come from under the ocarina, and your right hand from the top.

, You will alter the sounds if you blow harder or softer while you are playing. Although doing so can be used to produce different sounds, you first have to learn to primarily use fingering while controlling your breath. Ultimately, fingering controls the notes and breath controls the octave.

, To raise the pitch, remove your fingers from the holes. The more holes you uncover, the higher the pitch. The only hole you may not cover is the hole on the back between the back holes. This hole is where the sound comes out, and covering it will not allow your ocarina to produce sound.

, Since you just began your musical journey with your new ocarina, you may want to begin with tablatures. Tablatures, or tabs, are pictures that show you which holes to cover to produce a song. You can play using sheet music, but ocarinas use a different type of sheet music that may be difficult to learn at first.

Pine is an acceptable choice, although oak will yield a better tonal quality. Professional quality xylophones have keys made of rosewood or padauk, but these woods are harder to find.;
, A good approximation is to cut the lowest note to about 14 inches (35 cm) long and the highest note to about 10 inches (25 cm) long. The keys in between should gradually bridge the gap between these 2 lengths. With these lengths, the keys can be tuned easily to the C Major scale. The exact length of each key is not important, as you will be trimming them down during the tuning process.

, This is the most time-consuming step in the process. Lay each key out on a soft surface (such as a towel) so that it can resonate. Strike the key with a mallet and register the pitch on an electronic tuner. If the pitch is too low, you can raise it by shaving or filing off the edges of the key to make it shorter. If the pitch is too high, you can lower the pitch by carving out a curved gouge on the underside of the key. The gouge should be centered on the bar, and should generally be kept within the middle third of the bar. A rasp is the best tool for this, although a file or draw knife will also work. Continue checking the pitch throughout the tuning process.

, The nodes are the parts of the bar which will not vibrate when the bar resonates, and are located about 2/9 of the length of the bar in on each side. To find their exact position, sprinkle salt on each key and strike it repeatedly with a mallet. The salt will dance around on the bar and gather on the nodes (because there is no vibration there). Mark this position with a pencil.

, These holes should be centered across the width of the bar. Make each hole slightly larger than the nail that will be used to secure the key to the frame, because the key must have room to move when it is struck, or it will not resonate very much.

, You will need 4 pieces of wood for this, the dimensions of which do not matter much.


Lay the keys out from lowest to highest, with about 0.25 inches (6 mm) in between each key. The lowest-pitched key should be on the left, with the highest-pitched key on the right.
The total width of your xylophone should be about 18 inches (45 cm). Cut 2 pieces of your frame wood to this length, and then wrap them in a soft material (a towel or a worn-out piece of clothing will work). The fabric will ensure that the keys can still resonate and will not be knocking loudly against the frame during play.

, Drive nails through the pre-drilled holes in the keys and into the wood frame below.


Attach the 2 long pieces of wood to each other to keep the frame rigid. Take the other 2 pieces of wood reserved for the frame and screw, nail or glue them across the 2 long pieces to form a 4-sided frame.

, Go over the whole instrument with a piece of sandpaper to remove rough edges and improve the appearance.

Practice in front of a mirror, you might amuse yourself with your own comedy concentration face.

,
Reward yourself!,
If you have a friend who plays an instrument, you could practice together.,
Try playing your music in a different key, it can sound very cool and it always practice more fun.

",How to Make Cello Practice Fun," When you aren't practicing specific pieces for a concert or chair test, play what you like. It makes practicing more fun and it can be a good challenge (some film music out there is pretty complex).;
, If you're practicing for, say two hours, take two or three 15min breaks to stretch, get something to drink/eat or just move around. Then go back to playing and continue taking breaks as needed.

,,,, Every time you get through a piece without a single mistake, have a healthy treat you love like fresh raspberries, a small piece of dark chocolate or a favourite low cal savoury cracker.

, You don't have to play at the same time or play the same tune, you can take turns.

You’ll also need a general purpose hand-held sander, masking tape, a saw, a ruler or measuring tape, and a box cutter or sharp knife. You should be able to find all of these items from the hardware store.;
, Of course, you’ll need some bamboo as well, and you don’t always have to buy it. Even if it is not a plant that is native to your area, sometimes you can find it growing on the side of the road because these plants tend to take root and flourish almost anywhere. However, if you are unable to find bamboo out in nature, head to your local hardware store and ask around.


Also, look in your local yellow pages. Carpet stores sometimes have bamboo flooring that comes in bamboo rods that you could use., When you’re selecting bamboo, make sure that the diameter is between 3/4 inches and 7/8 inches. However, thin-walled bamboo about 1/8 inch-thick or so produces the best sound. Also, look for a good piece of seasoned bamboo that isn’t cracked. It shouldn’t be really flexible or have any visible cracks, rips, splinters or holes.Make sure that the bamboo has at least one node -- a notch where it is solid inside instead of hollow like the other parts of the bamboo. It’s usually marked by circular ridges that look like joints on the bamboo. One node at the end of the flute will become what is known as the “cork.” The node should be smooth and without holes on the inside or the outside so that the flute has proper tone., Use a hacksaw if necessary. You’ll also want to sand down any notches left behind from where you cut off the bamboo. If you have one, use the hand sander to do this; it’s much faster and easier than sanding by hand.


The piece of bamboo that you selected might have several nodes. If it’s a long piece of bamboo, select the part of the bamboo that you are going to work with and sand down that section so you don’t sand the entire bamboo stem unnecessarily.

, The length of the pipe determines the key that it plays. To make a flute that plays in the key of A, cut a 14 inch length of pipe. For an F flute, cut it to 18 inches, and for a key of D cut it to 21 inches. Choose a section of bamboo with joints that are a little bit more than half as far apart as the intended length of the instrument.


For instance, if you want a 14 inch flute, the nodes should be a little more than 7 inches apart from each other. In other words, there should be a little more than 7 inches of tube between each node.
The aim is to cut it so that there is a node at the end and another node more or less in the middle. You want the flute to have a node at one end and another more or less in the middle after you cut it to size. It should have at least one.
Wrap a piece of masking tape around the area that you want to cut, then cut it with the hacksaw. The tape helps stop the bamboo from splintering.
Cut outside of the node. Don’t cut into it.

, Choose the part of the bamboo with the node near the end to be your cork. Then, measure 2 cm (0.78 inches) out from the node and mark it with a pencil. This area is will be known as the cork of the flute. The blow hole, which is formally known as the embouchure won’t be placed far from it. Don’t cut into this area.

, Because if it has holes in it, then it the flute’s tone might not be proper.

, As previously noted, the inner portion of the nodes are solid, not hollow like the rest of the pipe. So, you’ll have to knock out all of the nodes except for the one near the end serving as your cork. You can use a hammer and chisel to do this. Stick the chisel or a sharp tool up against the node inside the tube, then hit the top of the tool with a hammer. You’ll slow chisel it away.


Another option is to burn out the nodes with a hot poker, but the safest option is most likely boring out the nodes with a long drill bit.

, Wrap sandpaper around a dowel rod about 20 inches long and tape the sandpaper to it. Then, rub the sandpaper against the inside of the bamboo to smooth the inside of the tube. Also, sand the places where the nodes were located so that it is as smooth as possible.

, Now that the bamboo is open, you can see the thickness of the walls, which you’ll need to know to calculate the diameter of the embouchure -- the blow as previously noted. Using your ruler, measure each one to the nearest millimeter and write down your measurements. Then, set them aside for later.

, The embouchure should be one diameter up from the cork -- the node you selected at the end of the bamboo. For instance, if the width or diameter of the bamboo is 8 centimeters (3.1 inches), then you will measure 8 centimeters (3.1 inches) up from the cork. Then mark it, and this is where the center of the blow hole will be placed.


The diameter is the length of a circle.

, Now, you need to know how wide to make the blow hole because the width of the hole makes a difference with the sound of the flute. Use a flute calculator such as Flutomat to calculate the measurements for you.


Input your measurements of the flute's inner diameter and wall thickness.Then, choose the key you want the flute to be in. If you cut your flute to a specific length for a specific key, you can skip this step if you want. The application will calculate the diameter for the embouchure and the other holes in the seven-note Western scale. Write down the diameters of each hole. For instance, suppose the diameter of the blow hole is 10mm (0.393 inches), then according to the calculator, the diameter of the following finger holes 1-7 might be 8.0 mm(0.3149 inches), 8.5 mm (0.335), 9 mm (0.354 inches), 7 mm (0.275 inches) ,9.5mm (0.374 inches) ,10mm (0.393), 5.5mm (0.217 inches).

, Use the flute calculator, which also calculates the space between the edge of each hole and the open end of the flute. It gives the measurements based on each holes distance from the embouchure. So, mark where each hole should be to make sure that they will fit on your pole. Once, all your measurements seem correct and everything seems to fit on the bamboo, then you’re ready to drill.

, Use wood clamps to clamp it down. Then, with the embouchure facing up, begin drilling with the 2mm (0.078 inches) drill bit where you made your mark for the first hole. Once you’ve made a small hole with the drill bit, increase to a larger drill bit like 8 mm (0.315 inches) . Steadily increase the size of the drill bit until you get to a bit larger enough to make the size of your holes. For instance, if your embouchure is 10 mm, increase your drill bits in increments until you get to a 10mm drill bit to make the hole that size.


When you’re drilling, hold the bit perpendicular to the bamboo with a steady hand. If you hold the drill at an angle or are unsteady as you drill, you might drill the bamboo improperly or splinter, crack or rip the bamboo. Be deliberate but careful as you drill.

, Use a Dremel or a similar rotary tool to make the hole nice and smooth. Put a sanding attachment on the rotary tool. Use one of the attachments that has medium grit sandpaper. (Feel the paper to check. The rougher the sandpaper, the more gritty the sandpaper.) Gently sand the hole with medium grit and then a smoother sandpaper while being careful not to change the shape or size of the hole.

, You need to test it to make sure you get a familiar, mellow, ""flute-like"" tone. If you need to make adjustments, sand the outside edge of the embouchure with a sanding file at a downward slant, but only do this if you think it needs adjustment. If it sounds good to you, it’s better to play it safe and not make any adjustments.

, Make sure that they are in the right place respective to the blowhole. The Flutomat calculator gives the space between each hold from the end of one hole to the end of the next hole. So, it doesn’t give you the hole’s center. You’ll need to make your hole one radius up -- half the diameter-- of the hole. This is where the center of the hole will be and where you’ll drill. Then, drill in the same manner that you drilled the blowhole.


Make sure your holes are marked in a straight line.
Drill in successively larger bits, which means start with the smaller bits to make a starter hole. Then, slowly increase to the larger bits to get to the size drill bit to make the appropriate size.
Some parts of the bamboo and thinner than other such as where a branch was growing. So, be mindful of this when you’re drilling.
If you have to drill a hole over a node, this area will be thicker than other areas. Take your time and drill slowly.

, With your rotary tool, sand the edges of the hole so that they are smooth. If you are scared of making a mistakes or sanding too much, use the sanding file. They’re also great for smaller holes. Once you’ve cleaned up the drill holes, you’re ready to play.

You might not be making music yet, but try to get your hands on an instrument and get a feel for it in your hands before committing to buy one or signing up for lessons.

a

Typically, if you want to sign up for band or orchestra at your school, call-outs are regularly held during which the directors allow you to experiment with instruments and select one. Go to one of these call-outs and check out all the different kinds of instruments.
Most instrument stores are excited to share their instruments with you and let you give them a shot. They might even be able to show you a few things.;
, One of the most common instruments to start out on, used in many different styles and regions, is the piano. From children to adults, the piano is an extraordinarily popular instrument to play and learn. Because you can actually see the notes in front of you, the piano is also a good instrument to build your knowledge of how music works, and your music-reading. Once you've learned the piano, you can also specialize in:


Organ
Accordion
Synthesizer
Harpsichord
Harmonium.

, Other than the piano, the most popular instrument from Hank to Hendrix is the guitar. Technically a classical stringed instrument, the popular electric guitar put the instrument into pop culture like no other instrument. It's fun for rock and roll, jazz, and almost any kind of music. Guitar also provides a good foundation for different kinds of folk or rock instruments:


Bass guitar
Mandolin
Banjo
Harp

Dulcimer.

, If you want to play in an orchestra, a string quartet, or have a particular interest in classical music, a stringed instrument might be right for you.These instruments are also commonly used for folk music and other acoustic sounds. You might consider the following instruments:


Violin
Viola
Cello

Double bass (also known as the upright bass).

, Brass instruments are so-called because they are traditionally extremely long metal tubes, bent in intricate patterns, featuring valves or keys to change the pitch, and made entirely of brass. Now they're generally made of different metals, but still work by vibrating your lips inside a metal mouthpiece. They're used in concert bands, jazz, marching bands, and many other types of music. Brass instruments include:


Trumpet
Trombone
Tuba
French horn
Baritone

Sousaphone.

, Like brass instruments, woodwinds are played with the power of the breath. While brass instruments use mouthpieces to blow through and vibrate your lips, however, woodwinds use reeds that vibrate themselves when you blow over them. They're made of many different combinations of metals, woods, and reeds, and no orchestra or jazz combo is complete without them. Woodwind instruments include:



Flute, piccolo, or fife
Saxophone
Clarinet
Oboe
Bassoon

, Holding down the bottom-end of most music groups are the percussionists. In rock bands and jazz combos, the drummer typically plays a drum kit, made of several drums organized at once to play simultaneously with sticks and pedals. In orchestras and concert bands, percussionists perform a quite large variety of instruments that are played by striking them with hands, mallets, or sticks. Percussion instruments include:


The drum set

vibraphone, Marimba, and xylophone

Glockenspiel

bells and Cymbals


Congas and bongos

Tympani
Woodblocks, cowbells, and triangles.

, There are literally thousands of instruments you could take up and hundreds of teachers who offer lessons. Explore the world of music and listen for things you like and you might enjoy playing. Some difficult-to-categorize instruments:


Harmonica
Djembe
Concertina
Bagpipes
Singing bowls
Ukulele
Mbira
Sitar.

, You want to make sure you end up with both an instrument that works for your size and your hands, as well as an appropriate size of that instrument for you. Long and slender fingers are desirable for string instruments, while some brass instruments are somewhat heavy and require the strength and lung-capacity necessary to play them.


Some instruments, like violin and guitar, are available in lots of different sizes that can be customizable for your abilities and your size. Child-sizes are common. Look into your options, and get something in your budget that feels comfortable. Talk to the employees at the instrument store to get a sense of appropriate sizes and models.
Some band directors try to steer people away from particular instruments like trumpet or saxophone because they're very popular. Pursue the instrument you want to play. There are one-handed guitarists and petite tuba players.

, You can very quickly develop bad habits by playing your instrument without the right posture, or by playing it out of tune. You need to develop the proper technique with your particular instrument, holding it, sitting right, and blowing or striking the strings in the correct position.


Have your band director, teacher, or music store employee to give you a tutorial on the proper technique for your instrument. If you don't have access to teachers, videos and diagrams online are excellent resources for technique.
Spend time tuning every time you sit down to play. Even unexpected instruments like the trombone need tuned, or you'll develop the wrong positioning on the slide when you're trying to hit the notes.

, Though it can be a bit like learning a new language, learning how to read music will expand your musical horizons considerably. You can learn any song just by looking at the sheet music, noting the melody, the rhythm, and even the feeling of the music in the page directions. It's an invaluable tool for students of any instrument.


Make sure you learn to read bass clef if you're learning bass guitar or low brass instruments like trombone, baritone, and tuba.

Learn and practice playing scales. On all instruments, playing scales will help you improve faster technically and help you become more familiar with the correct notes, building your muscle memory toward them.
As you progress, consider learning a little theory. Knowledge of simple chords and scales will broaden your musical imagination, you can do a great deal with a just a little. Ask a friend to show you, or find an online resource. Learn these basic structures at a comfortable pace, and you'll soon be tackling more advanced ideas.

, The difference between learning an instrument and giving it up is practice. Develop a practice routine and commit to it. Practice at least 30 minutes a day, every day, to develop the right consistent habits and learn to play the instrument like it deserves to be played.

https://www.wikihow.com/Learn-to-Play-an-Instrument

Consider taking private lessons. Instructional books and YouTube videos can only take you so far, especially with instruments like the violin or wind instruments. Suzuki method classes spend a great deal of time (sometimes years) playing on fake violin-shaped instruments to get the correct bowing technique. Having one-on-one attention is invaluable when you're trying to learn an instrument.
Make it easy to practice. Find a nice place in the house for your instrument. Store it where you spend your leisure time, or someplace where you're going to see it often during your day. The more accessible your instrument, the more you will pick it up and play it. Eventually you'll be picking it up every free minute you have.

, It's very important to always practice playing in time. One of the signs of a novice player is that they often will play the notes as quickly as they are able, rather than playing them appropriately. When you learn the difference between playing in 4/4 time and waltz, when you learn the difference between quarter notes and whole notes, these things will be more clear, but it's critical to play according to the rhythm of the song that you're learning to play. Even if you're practicing scales, play in time.


Find a beat off of which to work: there are free metronomes online. A ticking clock or the radio will function well for you too.

, It's no fun to play a trombone with a sticky slide, a sax with old reeds, or a guitar with gnarly green strings. Learn how to take care of your instrument, taking the time to clean, maintain, and respect it for the piece of art that it is. You won't develop bad habits in your technique and you'll get more life out of your instrument, not to mention a cleaner and more true sound. Take a few minutes before and after every practice session to take care of your instrument and do it right.

, If you're in school, consider joining the orchestra or the concert band to take advantage of the lessons and the training that it has to offer. Even if your eventual goal is to become a rock drummer, the fundamentals offered in school band are quite valuable, not to mention that you have access to the school's instrumental resources, practice spaces, and teachers. They're usually sympathetic to your music goals, as well. Sign up!

, If you're trying to learn an instrument on your own, start playing with other people to learn as much as you can about playing in a group, playing with the right technique, and developing good habits. Aside from all you'll learn, it's also a whole lot more fun than playing scales in your bedroom. Try meeting other players at:


Music festivals
Open-mic nights
Fiddlers' jams
Guitar shops.

, Music is more than notes. No matter how boring a piece, even if it's like a nursery rhyme or a march, learn to inject feeling into the music and play it with your heart and soul. If you're finding this hard, imagine you're telling a story with the music and actually say an appropriate story in your head. Really listen to the music that you're playing and learn to give it color and character. Make it come alive.

, Learning to play on the fly will make you a better all-around player. One part scales and one part creativity, playing extemporaneously means that you're learning the ""language"" of music. You're one step closer to speaking it fluently.


Start sight-reading sheet music when you get comfortable with your instrument. Rather than playing the Darth Vader theme one more time on your tuba, try learning something else and seeing if you can play it right the first time. Stick with it until you've got it just as much as the Imperial March.

, Learning to play an instrument takes years of practice. It won't happen overnight. If you want to be good, commit to your instrument. Jimi Hendrix used to sleep with his guitar and some expert players are even buried with their horns, violas, and drumsticks. Ustad Ali Akbar Khan, a Hindustani classical musician, once famously said: ""If you practice for ten years, you may begin to please yourself. After 20 years, you may become a performer and please the audience. After 30 years, you may please even your guru, but you must practice for many more years before you finally become a true artist—then you may please even God.""

Take care of your instrument.,
Pay attention to your instrument when you are playing it.,
Get an idea of your instrument's general outside appearance.,
Take a look at the pads and check to see if they're leaking.,
Check the instrument's mechanism.,
Make sure your corks are in good condition.,
Decide if there's anything you want adjusted, even if it's not really something ""wrong"" with the instrument.,
Take your instrument (and mental/written list of things to be done) down to the music store, and ask for a COA.,
When the repair work is done, play-test your instrument, take it home, and enjoy it, now that it looks and plays its best.

",How to Know when It's Time to Clean Your Musical Instrument or COA," While this should be obvious, it's good to be in the habit of being careful. Don't drop it, use the case as a footrest, hold it in a way that can damage the keys, skip swabbing it, etc. Taking care of your instrument can save you a lot of time at the repair shop and a good bit of money.;
, If you are alert and familiar with your instrument, you should notice almost immediately when something isn't working right. However, there are some things that you may not notice when playing, so every so often, sit down and take a really good look at your instrument.

, The ""C"" part of COA covers both cleaning the inside and cleaning the outside. While the outside appearance of your instrument doesn't really affect your playing, most musicians want to keep their instruments looking nice, and if you try to sell it in the future, you'll be glad that you kept up its appearance.


Examine the keys of the instrument. Are they in serious need of polishing? Is the plating coming off? You may want to see about having your instrument re-keyed or re-plated, if they look bad enough.
People with wooden instruments - Is the wood cracked or badly scratched? Cracked wood can affect playing, and some scratches can be smoothed off.
Saxophone players - What does the body of your sax look like? If it hasn't been polished in a while, it may look kind of dull and smudgy.

,


Take a look at the color and condition of the pads. Color doesn't always affect playing ability, but if the pads are cracked, swollen, or growing mold, it might be time to replace them. It may be that only some of the pads are in bad condition, in which case you can just get your instrument partially re-padded.
Check for leaks.

For most woodwinds, this can be done by taking each individual section of your instrument, covering all the holes with one hand, covering one end of the section with the palm of the other, and blowing into the open end. You should not feel or hear any air escaping.
For saxophones, find a relatively small but high-powered flashlight, take your instrument into the dark, and either shine the flashlight through the top (without the neck), or lower it into the instrument on a swab string (if it's very small), and check to see if there's any light escaping. Where there's light, there's a leak. You may want to have someone else hold the flashlight for this. This method can also work on some other woodwinds, but the flashlight will need to be a lot smaller, and you'll have to be very careful.



, There may be bent rods, missing screws, badly oiled joints, or any number of things that you may not have noticed.


Play through the range of the instrument. See if any notes are unusually hard to get out or are woefully out of tune. This can indicate an issue with the keys, or it may be the pads again.
Make note if any of the keys are too hard or too easy to move - you should be able to make a key move fairly easily, but there should be enough resistance that you can feel what you're doing.
Check carefully for bent rods or missing screws. You may first be alerted if you notice that some keys ""wiggle"" when they shouldn't. You may want to have a friend who plays the same instrument, a conductor, or a director take a second look, to see if you missed anything.

, No section of the cork should be missing, spit shouldn't leak out between the sections, and the instrument should not fall apart or wiggle where the sections meet. If you are experiencing any of these problems, get your instrument re-corked, or at least fix the cork(s) that are giving you trouble.

, You may decide that it would be easier to play certain notes if a certain key was tightened or loosened slightly, you want your keys silver-plated instead of nickel-plated (since you've already decided to have it re-keyed), or things of that nature.

, Ask how much it'll cost, and when you can pick your instrument up. If not much is wrong, you may be able to walk out with in in a matter of minutes, or an hour or so. If it's having anything major replaced (corks, keys, pads, etc.), you may be looking at a few days to a week.

Explore the theremin community.",How to Make a Theremin," A theremin is basically a box with two antennas, one of which controls the pitch of the instrument, the other of which controls the volume. These antennas create electromagnetic fields which are ""played"" by manipulating them with the hands. Coils of tight-pack wire act as oscillators, producing signals fed into the antennae.While it may seem like spooky magic, the fields are created by relatively straightforward circuitry. A theremin involves the following components, most of which you should be able to purchase at electronics supply:


Pitch-reference oscillator
Pitch-control oscillator
Mixer
Volume-control oscillator
Volume-resonant circuit and voltage-controlled amplifier
Audio amplifier
12-volt power supply;
, Building a theremin from scratch isn’t a project for a weekender with a love for spooky sounds. If you want to build one easily and cheaply, buy a kit, follow the instructions and put it together. If you want to wire your own, there’s a lot you need to learn to do first. Even if you want to put together a theremin, it’s likely that you’ll need to understand how to read a basic schematic. To build a theremin, you need to know how to:


Read an electronic schematic
Solder electronics
Wire a potentiometer
Wire a circuit
If you want to put a theremin together, kits are available at a variety of different price ranges, some of them relatively easy to put together and some more complex. It's somewhat easier than starting from scratch and getting all the boards and circuits you'll need individually. Unless you're an experienced maker of circuits, it'll be difficult, though not impossible, to make your own theremin without a kit., Find or construct a box big enough to house the theremin's internal circuitry. A professional theremin, the type of which can be played comfortably, should be large enough to stand in front of, your arms held shoulder-width apart, about 24 inches (61 cm) wide for most adults.


The top should be hinged so you can install the components and make adjustments when necessary. Kits are available for this purpose, which can be a good idea to get the basic housing shape, even if you still want to customize the circuitry.

, A monopole antenna for pitch needs to be attached to the top of the box and a similar antenna for pitch needs to be installed vertically. A loop antenna used to control the volume will be attached to the side of the box. The looping antenna is sometimes a somewhat more difficult device to find, but should be available at specialty electronics stores.


While it may seem like it's more important to wire the circuits first, it's much easier to get the housing in place before you start worrying about the circuitry, to make sure that everything is spaced accurately and comfortably to play. Just as you'd build the guitar's body before wiring the pickups, you want to start with the housing. You're making an instrument, not a radio.

, The pitch of a theremin is controlled by creating a circuit between a variable oscillator and a reference oscillator, which should be available at specialty electronics stores as individual units. Each should be tuned to the same frequency, ideally in the middle of the low frequency radio range.


The pitch-reference oscillator should work around 172kHz, used in conjunction with a 10k potentiometer. The signal this oscillator creates should be fed into the mixer with screened cable. The pitch-variable oscillator should also work around 172khz, and will be affected by the stray capacitance of the reference unit.Potentiometers need to be wired into the circuit to make the relationship of your hand movement to the change in pitch more linear. Without them, the instrument's pitch be almost impossible to control, changing wildly with only a microscopic movement of the hand.

, Using screened cable, wire the circuit of the pitch control components into the antenna when you're finished. When playing the theremin, your hand changes the capacitance of the antenna, which will change the frequency of the variable oscillator. Essentially, you're sending the signal into the antenna to be manipulated manually.

, This should also be in the low frequency radio range and carefully tuned, operating somewhere in the neighborhood of 441kHz. This signal will be influenced directly by the volume antenna, manipulating it by hand. A 10k trim potentiometer needs to be installed to enable the operator to tune the theremin appropriately.


Send the output of this variable oscillator into a volume resonant circuit. The output will be a DC voltage that varies according to the output of the variable oscillator.
Tuned correctly, the oscillator frequency will match the tuning of the volume-resonant circuit as the operator's hand approaches the antenna, causing the signal to cut off gradually. In other words, the closer the hand to the antenna, the quieter the sound.

, The purpose of the mixer is to compare the frequency of the variable oscillator with the reference frequency. The output will be an audio signal between 20Hz and 20kHz. Assembling the mixer is the simplest step in the process. Fed with two slightly different frequencies from the oscillators, the mixer will produce an output with a complex waveform, giving it the distinctive warble we associate with the sci-fi sound of the theremin.


The output actually contains two distinct frequencies, which require the need of a low pass filter, that is two 0.0047uF capacitors and a 1k resistor, used to extract the output and boost it into a listenable range.

, Route the outputs of the mixer and the volume resonant circuit into a voltage-controlled amplifier. The voltage from the volume resonant circuit changes the amplitude of the audio signal from the mixer, helping to boost the sound and control the volume of the instrument.

, Send the output of the voltage controlled amplifier into an audio amplifier and then a speaker to amplify the sound created by the electromagnetic fields as you manipulate them. In a pinch, you can use the internal components or a guitar amp you connect to the theremin with a jack installed in the back of the case.

, You should need a power converter that operates at about 12 volts to power a basic theremin with this assembly. You can build a step-down transformer that will convert the normal house voltage or buy a power cord with a built in converter.


Use extreme caution if you're not an experienced electrician. There's a fairly serious amount of voltage going through these circuits, and fire or injury can result from mistakes. Brush up on the skills outlined at the beginning of this article before trying to wire these circuits and apply them to power.

, If you're going to take the time to build a theremin from scratch, it's important to tune it accurately and make sure that you've got a playable prototype. Each module should be built, tested, and tuned so that the final assembly is the simple process of hooking everything together and performing a few final adjustments.


In order to test and tune the modules, hook your theremin into the input jacks on an oscilloscope and you'll be able to see the sound waves you're creating as you manipulate the theremin. Adjust the modules accordingly, if the sound waves are off.

, It's important to work from a detailed schematic and brush up on the skills necessary to circuit-wiring if you're going to undertake a DIY theremin project. Tons of schematics, tips, and tricks of the theremin-building trade are available online. You can learn more about building theremins with the community of ThereminWorld."

Publish or share your review.",How to Write a Movie Review," You want to get the reader hooked immediately. This sentence needs to give them a feel for your review and the movie -- is it good, great, terrible, or just okay? -- and keep them reading. Some ideas include:



Comparison to Relevant Event or Movie: ""Every day, our leaders, politicians, and pundits call for ""revenge""-- against ISIS, against rival sports teams, against other political parties. But few of them understand cold, destructive, and ultimately hallow thrill of revenge as well as the characters of Blue Ruin.""

Review in a nutshell ""Despite a compelling lead performance by Tom Hanks and a great soundtrack, Forrest Gump never gets out of the shadow of its weak plot and questionable premise.""

Context or Background Information: ""Boyhood might be the first movie made where knowing how it was produced -- slowly, over 12 years, with the same actors -- is just as crucial as the movie itself.""

, Don't leave the reader guessing whether you like the movie or not. Let them know early on, so that you can spend the rest of the time ""proving"" your rating.

Using stars, a score out of 10 or 100, or the simple thumbs-up and thumbs-down is a quick way to give your thoughts. You then write about why you chose that rating.

Great Movie: ""American Hustle is the rare movie that succeeds on almost every level, where each character, scene, costume, and joke firing on all cylinders to make a film worth repeated viewings.""

Bad Movie: ""It doesn't matter how much you enjoy kung-fu and karate films: with 47 Ronin, you're better off saving your money, your popcorn, and time.""

Okay Movie: ""I loved the wildly uneven Interstellar far more than I should have, but that doesn't mean it is perfect. Ultimately, the utter awe and spectacle of space swept me through the admittedly heavy-handed plotting and dialogue.""

, This is where taking notes during the movie really pays off. No one cares about your opinion if you can't give facts that support your argument.


Great: ""Michael B. Jordan and Octavia Spencer's chemistry would carry Fruitvale Station even if the script wasn't so good. The mid-movie prison scene in particular, where the camera never leaves their faces, show how much they can convey with nothing but their eyelids, the flashing tension of neck muscles, and a barely cracking voice.""

Bad: ""Jurassic World's biggest flaw, a complete lack of relatable female characters, is only further underscored by a laughably unrealistic shot of our heroine running away from a dinosaur -- in heels.""

Okay: ""At the end of the day, Snowpiercer can't decide what kind of movie it wants to be. The attention to detail in fight scenes, where every weapon, lightbulb, and slick patch of ground is accounted for, doesn't translate to an ending that seems powerful but ultimately says little of substance.""

, Plot is just one piece of a movie, and shouldn't dictate your entire review. Some movies don't have great or compelling plots, but that doesn't mean the movie itself is bad. Other things to focus on include:


Cinematography: ""Her is a world drenched in color, using bright, soft reds and oranges alongside calming whites and grays that both build, and slowly strip away, the feelings of love between the protagonists. Every frame feels like a painting worth sitting in.""

Tone: ""Despite the insane loneliness and high stakes of being stuck alone on Mars, The Martian's witty script keeps humor and excitement alive in every scene. Space may be dangerous and scary, but the joy of scientific discovery is intoxicating.""

Music and Sound: ""No Country For Old Men's bold decision to skip music entirely pays off in spades. The eerie silence of the desert, punctuated by the brief spells of violent, up-close-and-personal sound effects of hunter and hunted, keeps you constantly on the edge of your seat.""

Acting: ""While he's fantastic whenever he's on the move, using his cool stoicism to counteract the rampaging bus, Keanu Reeves can't quite match his costar in the quiet moments of Speed, which falter under his expressionless gaze.""

, Give the review some closure, usually by trying back to your opening fact. Remember, people read reviews to decide whether or not they should watch a movie. End on a sentence that tells them.


Great: ""In the end, even the characters of Blue Ruin know how pointless their feud is. But revenge, much like every taut minute of this thriller, is far too addictive to give up until the bitter end.""""

Bad: ""Much like the oft-mentioned ""box of chocolates"", Forest Gump has a couple of good little morsels. But most of the scenes, too sweet by half, should have been in the trash long before this movie was put out.""

Okay: ""Without the novel, even revolutionary concept, Boyhood may not be a great movie. It might not even be ""good.""But the power the film find in the beauty of passing time and little, inconsequential moments -- moments that could only be captured over 12 years of shooting -- make Linklater's latest an essential film for anyone interested in the art of film.""

, You can do this before or after you watch the movie, but you should definitely do it before you write the review, because you'll need to weave the facts into your review as you write. Here's what you need to know:


The title of the film, and the year it came out.
The director's name.
The names of the lead actors.
The genre.

, Before you sit down to watch a film, get out a notepad or a laptop to take notes. Movies are long, and you can easily forget details or major plot points. Taking notes allows you to jot down little things you can return to later.


Make a note every time something sticks out to you, whether it's good or bad. This could be costuming, makeup, set design, music, etc. Think about how this detail relates to the rest of the movie and what it means in the context of your review.
Take note of patterns you begin to notice as the movie unfolds.
Use the pause button frequently so you make sure not to miss anything, and rewind as necessary.

, Analyze the different components that came together in the movie as you watch. During or after your viewing, ask yourself what impression the movie left with you in these areas:


Direction. Consider the director and how he or she choose to portray/explain the events in the story. If the movie was slow, or didn't include things you thought were necessary, you can attribute this to the director. If you've seen other movies directed by the same person, compare them and determine which you like the most.
Cinematography. What techniques were used to film the movie? What setting and background elements helped to create a certain tone?
Writing. Evaluate the script, including dialogue and characterization. Did you feel like the plot was inventive and unpredictable or boring and weak? Did the characters' words seem credible to you?
Editing. Was the movie choppy or did it flow smoothly from scene to scene? Did they incorporate a montage to help build the story? And was this obstructive to the narrative or did it help it? Did they use long cuts to help accentuate an actor's acting ability or many reaction shots to show a group's reaction to an event or dialogue? If visual effects were used were the plates well chosen and were the composited effects part of a seamless experience? (Whether the effects looked realistic or not is not the jurisdiction of an editor, however, they do choose the footage to be sent off to the compositors so this could still affect the film.)
Costume design. Did the clothing choices fit the style of the movie? Did they contribute to the overall tone, rather than digressing from it?
Set design. Consider how the setting of the film influenced its other elements. Did it add or subtract from the experience for you? If the movie was filmed in a real place, was this location well-chosen?
Score or soundtrack. Did it work with the scenes? Was it over/under-used? Was it suspenseful? Amusing? Irritating? A soundtrack can make or break a movie, especially if the songs have a particular message or meaning to them.

, It's impossible to fully understand a movie you've only seen one time, especially if you're pausing it often to take notes. Watch it at least once more before you compose your review. Pay attention to details you might have missed the first time around. Pick new points of focus this time; if you took a lot of notes on the acting the first time you watched the movie, focus on the cinematography the second time around.

, Now that you've thoroughly studied the movie, what unique insights can you bring to the table? Come up with a thesis, a central idea to discuss and back up with your observations on the various elements of the film. Your thesis should be discussed in the first paragraph of your review. Having a thesis will take your review beyond the plot summary stage and into the realm of film criticism, which is rightfully its own art form. Ask yourself the following questions to come up with a compelling thesis for your review:


Does the film reflect on a current event or contemporary issue? It could be the director's way of engaging in a bigger conversation. Look for ways to relate the content of the film to the ""real"" world.
Does the film seem to have a message, or does it attempt to elicit a specific response or emotion from the audience? You could discuss whether or not it achieves its own goals.
Does the film connect with you on a personal level? You could write a review stemming from your own feelings and weave in some personal stories to make it interesting for your readers.

, It's good to give readers an idea of what they'll be in for if they decide to see the movie you're reviewing. Give a brief summary of the plot in which you identify the main characters, describe the setting, and give a sense of the central conflict or point of the movie. Never break the number one rule of movie reviews: don't give too much away. Don't ruin the movie for your readers!


When you name characters in your plot summary, list the actors' names directly afterward in parenthesis.
Find a place to mention the director's name and the full movie title.
If you feel you must discuss information that might ""spoil"" things for readers, warn them first.

, Write several paragraphs discussing interesting elements of the movie that support your thesis. Discuss the acting, the direction, the cinematography, the setting, and so on, using clear, entertaining prose that keeps your readers engaged.


Keep your writing clear and easy to understand. Don't use too much technical filmmaking jargon, and make your language crisp and accessible.
Present both the facts and your opinion. For example, you might state something such as, ""The Baroque background music was a jarring contrast to the 20th century setting."" This is a lot more informative then simply saying, ""The music was a strange choice for the movie.""

, If you make a statement about the movie, back it up with a descriptive example. Describe the way scenes look, the way a certain person acted, camera angles, and so on. You can quote dialogue to help you make your points as well. In this way you are giving your readers a feel for the movie and continuing to express your critique of the film at the same time.

, You could treat your review like a formal college essay, but it's more interesting if you make it your own. If your writing style is usually witty and funny, your review should be no exception. If you're serious and dramatic, that works, too. Let your language and writing style reflect your unique perspective and personality - it's much more entertaining for the reader.

, It should tie back to your original thesis and provide some guidance as to whether the audience should go see the movie. Your conclusion should also be compelling or entertaining on its own, since it's the end of your piece of writing.

, Once you've finished the first draft, read it through and decide whether it flows well and has the right structure. You may need to shift paragraphs around, delete sentences, or add more material here and there to fill out parts that are stunted. Give your review at least one editorial pass, and maybe two or three, before you consider it to be editorially sound.


Ask yourself whether your review stayed true to your thesis. Did your conclusion tie back in with the initial ideas you proposed?
Decide whether your review contains enough details about the movie. You may need to go back and add more description here and there to give readers a better sense of what the movie's about.
Decide whether your review is interesting enough as a stand-alone piece of writing. Did you contribute something original to this discussion? What will readers gain from reading your review that they couldn't from simply watching the movie?

, Make sure you've spelled all the actors' names correctly and that you got all the dates right. Clean up typos, grammatical errors, and other spelling errors as well. A clean, proofread review will seem much more professional than one that's full of silly mistakes.

, Post it on your blog, share it in a movie discussion forum, put it up on Facebook, or email it to your friends and family. Movies are the quintessential art form of our time, and like all art, they spark controversy, provide a venue for self-reflection, and greatly influence our culture. All this means they're worth discussing, whether they're flops or works of pure genius. Congratulations for contributing your valuable opinion to the discussion.

Before proceeding, please realize that movie hopping is grounds for being banned from the theater or escorted out.,
Choose a large multi-plex, something with a long hallway that has multiple theaters or even better, multiple floors.,
Find the times for the movies online.,
Re-adjust the start times listed by adding 15 minutes, that’s approximately the real start time after all the commercials and trailers have played.

,
Factor in the actual length of the movie to the newly adjusted start time, that’s when the movie ends.

,
Take this list to figure out what times are best for certain movies, so that you aren't late!

,
Go to the matinée on a weekday, the staff will be minimal and the chances that an usher will be watching theater doors will be slim.

,
Purchase the ticket of the most popular movie you’ve chosen to see that day, be sure to buy it for the time you actually expect to see it since that will be the theater most likely watched by ushers.

,
Have your ticket torn and enter like normal, do not act suspicious and don’t look stressed.

,
Buy your snacks and (optional) enter the theater of the movie you have scheduled to see and repeat throughout your day, just casually walk in and out of the movies at your schedule times.

,
Enjoy the day of movies, with proper planning you'll be able to see 3 movies for the price of one.

",How to Theater Hop," Very rarely you can be arrested for theft of services (similar to shoplifting).;
, Be sure it’s a place that has a ticket taker at the main entrance and not in front of the theater doors.

, Be sure to use a site that lists the length of each movie. You can use a movie hopping schedule application called The Movie Hop or TheaterTag.com to plan a movie schedule.

Understand the theme's underlying the film to ask the questions:


""What does the black community have to show for its 95% support of the Democratic Party?",How to Recognize Features of Economic Philosophy Presented in the Film Runaway Slave (Conservativism)," View behind the scenes info at the movie page entitled ""Run from tyranny to liberty"".,,, C.L. Bryant, a featured character in the story, who refers to himself as the “runaway slave.” A former NAACP chapter president, he left the organization after ""concluding its goals were more about political posturing than actual civil rights"". Rev. Bryant says he had been taught that ""blacks must think a certain way"", but he now says he has: ""Escaped the bondage of progressivism"" to individualized, personal responsibility.
""Denounced the shackles of entitlements"" (to make self-empowerment) to get out of slavery to government hand-outs.
""Committed himself to helping others"" -- to stop the racial group stereotype/stigma and launch as equal, as individuals.

, Rev. Bryant takes viewers on a historic journey across America that traces the footsteps of runaway slaves who escaped to freedom along routes that became known as the Underground Railroad. Consider how he says that he now travels a “new underground railroad” upon which black conservatives are speaking out against big government policies (and leaders) having established a “new plantation” including:Civil rights leaders. Check why he says that the NAACP and other so-called civil rights leadership help ""keep the Black community 95 percent beholden to one political party"". While Rev. Bryant’s compelling story helps launch the film, we soon discover he is not alone as he treks across the new Underground Railroad in America.
Interviews. View and listen to RUNAWAY SLAVE featured interviews with politicians, community leaders and everyday Americans, including the founder of the ""FDR: Frederick Douglass Republicans"" national organization, related to the philosophy of the 19th century runaway, Frederick Douglass -- who after escaping slavery, became a respected, storied black leader, a Republican, in the abolitionist movement. Douglass was the intellectual, living embodiment of the Black answer to slaveholders' self-serving arguments that slaves did not have the intellectual capacity to live independently. He engaged American citizens by his knowledge, incisive oratory and lucid, antislavery writing, as an exemplary citizen, a runaway slave, wikipedia:Frederick Douglass. The Runaway Slave movie salutes Frederick Douglass Foundation.

, View the RUNAWAY SLAVE’s numerous heroes -- who are featured “Conductors” on the new Underground Railroad -- and who speak of liberating all Americans from the ""Government Plantation that has left the black community dealing with this new form of slavery"". And, they are black conservatives speaking out to say that all Americans can truly be, “Free at last!” -- some who are very well known, including: Dr. Alveda King -- the daughter of the late, slain civil rights activist, Rev. A. D. King (MLK's slain brother) and Naomi Barber King is niece of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. She is a Minister in her Church, a prominent pro-life activist, and author. She commented, ""Runaway Slave exceeded my expectations"";
Deneen Borelli -- a Fellow with Project 21, a national public policy group and network of black conservatives based in Washington, D.C. Deneen currently regularly appears on MSNBC, CNN, the BBC and C-SPAN and serves as an official contributor on many of the Fox News Channel programs. Deneen’s commentaries ""promote the importance of freedom and limited government"", and she points out the connection between ""personal responsibility and social advancement"".
Thomas Sowell -- black American economist, social theorist, political philosopher, and author of more than 30 books. Dr. Sowell has served on faculties of universities, including Cornell and UCLA, and worked for ""think tanks"" such as the Urban Institute and at the Hoover Institution since 1980;
Allen West -- U.S. Congressman of Florida had previously risen in the U.S. Army to Lieutenant Colonel. After 22 years in the Army he retired, but returned as a civilian advisor to assist Afghan troops;
Herman Cain -- a candidate for the 2012 U.S. Republican presidential nomination has a background as a successful business executive (Godfathers Pizza, etc.), syndicated columnist, and radio host. Before his business career began, he worked as a degreed mathematician in ballistics as a civilian employee of the U.S. Navy;
Star Parker -- commentator and syndicated columnist and founder and president of CURE, the Center for Urban Renewal Education -- created CURE to fight dependence and poverty. Before Star's personal ""transformation from welfare dependent to conservative crusader"", she had seven years of first-hand experience in the grip of government, welfare dependency. Star is a regular commentator on CNN, TBN, CSPAN, CBN, and FOX News...

, So, is the community truly 'free at last?' "" Message of Rev. C.L. Bryant in the film:“Run away from economic slavery. Run toward the blessings of liberty. Let us remain strong in this fight. Run away from socialism, run away from progressivism. And if you get tired, America… run harder!”

Take breaks.",How to Stay Up to Watch a Film," The night before your event, be sure to get a good night's sleep. This will make sure that you're fully rested for the next night. If you're a kid, try to get 6-8 hours of sleep. If you're an adult, you might be able to get away with 5-7 hours sleep, but more is always recommended. If you've been working hard at school or work, feel free to give yourself the extra hour or two sleeping. Don't be lazy all day though. If you don't get a full night's sleep the night before, taking a nap halfway through the day is better than nothing.;
, While everyone has different opinions on what a good film actually is, choose one that won't bore you to sleep, literally. Films with fast paced action and music generally keep you awake better than slow, love-based films. James Bond is a great film to watch because it has a lot of action in it and will make you want to stay awake and watch more. War films, like Saving Private Ryan are also very good but might make you fall asleep at the dull parts. Try to choose a film that's interesting from start to finish.

, Resist the urge to snuggle up in bed with three blankets, even if it's winter. This will only make you very warm, and heat will make you feel more tired. Instead, lay or sit on the top of your bed. This might may make you a little bit uncomfortable, but at least you'll stay awake. Also, remove your socks and don't get your nightwear on. Stay in your jeans. Open your window and your door to let in more cold air, keeping the room colder. When you do this, make sure the heaters are turned off so you don't waste your money and electricity.

, When you feel yourself dozing off, take a sip of some ice cold water. This should help to shock your body into staying awake. Water is a better drink than something with caffeine in it because caffeine gives you a temporary buzz, and then a huge crash meaning that it will drain you of all energy. Also, water is healthier and will make you need to go to the toilet more often. Taking the trip to the toilet can help to keep you awake in itself. Staying up all night isn't healthy so you don't want to add bad chemicals to your body. That will make it even more unhealthy.

, The sound going directly into your brain will naturally make you want to focus on the film because there isn't anything else to focus on. This should make you want to stay awake to see where the noises are coming from rather than falling asleep. Explosions, car chases and sudden gunshots will shock your brain and hopefully make you feel more awake again. If, unfortunately, you do fall asleep during the film, the sound in the earphones might wake you up again so you wouldn't have missed much. It will also allow everybody else in the house to fall asleep because they won't be disturbed by the sound of your film.

, Foods that contain lots of Vitamin B12 such as cheese, milk and other dairy products will give your energy a slight boost. Fish is a good choice too. You can also eat fruits (apples, oranges) which contain Vitamin C and Protein. These foods are also very healthy and will reduce the unhealthy factor of staying awake. If you get bored of eating apple after apple, mix it up a little. Make a fruit salad containing apples, oranges, grapes, bananas and kiwis. Pour in some fruit juice if you want it even more juicy. Squirt some lemon juice on the top of it all. This will give the fruit salad an extra kick. The fruit and Vitamins will keep your energy up while the sourness of the lemon juice shocks your taste buds. If you really don't like the taste, wash it down with water.

, Films are usually around two hours long. To sit in the same spot for two hours drinking ice water and eating sour fruit salads really is a lot to ask. Don't force yourself if you're finding it difficult. Pause the film and take a slight break. These can be anywhere from five minutes to fifteen minutes. Don't spend too long on your break though because the longer you stay up, the more tired you will become. On your break you should wash your face or take a shower. This will shock your body into feeling more awake and alert. Because you've been drinking water and eating juicy foods, you will probably need to go toilet too. Do some last minute stretches and start again.

Genre-bending: The goal of this tactic is to make watching the movie as ridiculous of an experience as possible.,
Drinking games (note that alcoholic options are only suitable for viewers of legal drinking age):


As the film progresses, keep track of particularly cheesy, cliché, or otherwise awful and consistent aspects of the cinematography, acting, or plot.",How to Watch a Bad Movie from Beginning to End2,"


You can imagine that the movie is a totally unrelated genre to what is intended by the director and the actors.Imagine that a drama is a comedy or that a rom-com is a horror film. Try to add some flare to make things interesting, for example, Try to imagine Inception as a satirical comedy making fun of Sigmund Freud's popular work on The Interpretation of Dreams.
You can use musical accompaniment to totally re-frame the context of the movie you are watching. For example, try playing intense classical concertos as the backdrop to a child's movie or a terrible attempted comedy (possible candidates for your airwaves available here: ).
Caution: only attempt this method if you are in unhostile territory, watching a bad film by yourself or with a group who also believes the film is bad. Attempting this tactic with a loved one who actually likes the movie in question could produce disastrous consequences. Consider yourself warned.

, Perhaps there are tasteless voiceovers or facial close-ups. Corny one-liners that are either intended to be funny or diabolical but fail miserably. Once you find a consistently n00bish characteristic of the film, you and your cohort can begin to consume alcohol (or lemonade, or RC Cola, or green tea, or a mango-kiwi smoothie) each time that this same type of scenario arises in the film. Depending on the length of the film this game could become fatal and incredibly sloppy. Be careful.

Issue another insult with ""petaQ.""",How to Speak Klingon1," Each letter has its own specific way of being pronounced, though, and you must study up on how to pronounce letters correctly before you can speak words correctly.


Lowercase ""b,"" ""ch,"" ""j,"" ""l,"" ""m,"" ""n,"" ""p,"" ""t,"" ""v,"" and ""w"" are all pronounced the same way in Klingon as they are in English.
Lowercase ""a"" is pronounced like the English ""ah,"" or like the ""a"" in ""father.""
Lowercase ""e"" is pronounced like the short ""e"" sound in English, as in the word ""led"" or ""bed.""
Capital ""I"" is pronounced like the short ""i"" sound in English, as in the word ""hit"" or ""bit.""
Lowercase ""o"" is pronounced like the long ""o"" sound in English, as in the word ""note"" or ""wrote.""
Lowercase ""u"" is pronounced like the long ""u"" sound in English, as in the word ""prune"" or ""you.""
Capital ""D"" is pronounced similarly to the English ""d,"" but you must touch the tip of your tongue to the highest point in your mouth, rather than near the teeth as you would with its English counterpart.
The capital ""H"" is a harsh sound made in the throat, similar to the ""h"" in the German ""Bach."" Leave it unvoiced. Similarly, the ""gh"" sound is considered one letter in Klingon. Produce it in the back of your throat as a gargle, similar to the Klingon ""H,"" but voiced.
The ""ng"" is treated as a single letter in Klingon but is pronounced the same way ""ng"" is in English.
Lowercase ""q"" is similar to the English ""k"" but is made further back in your throat. Your tongue should actually brush the uvula or the opening of your throat. Capital ""Q,"" on the other hand, is similar to the Klingon lowercase ""q"" but must be immediately followed with the Klingon ""H"" sound.
Lowercase ""r"" is similar to its English counterpart, but slightly rolled.
Capital ""S"" is similar to the English ""sh,"" but is made by moving your tongue near the roof of your mouth rather than near the teeth.
The ""tlh"" is treated as a single letter in Klingon. Begin with a ""t"" sound, but drop your tongue to the sides of your mouth rather than immediately down. From there, hiss out the ""l"" sound.
Lowercase ""y"" is pronounced like the English ""y"" at the beginning of a word, as in ""you"" or ""yet.""
The single apostrophe (') is treated as a letter in Klingon. It is the same sound produced in English for words that start with a vowel, as in ""uh"" or ""ah."" The sound is, essentially, a catch or soft pause in the throat. In Klingon, this can be used in the middle of a word.;
,""It is the equivalent of ""hello,"" but translates more closely to, ""What do you want?""

, The former to mean ""yes,"" while the latter means ""no.""

, Roughly translated, it means ""I understand."" Similarly, ""jIyajbe'"" means ""I don't understand.""

, The former means ""Good!"" The latter means ""Well done!""

, It literally means, ""Do you speak Klingon?"" If someone asks you that question but you do not feel confident in your Klingon speaking abilities yet, you can answer, ""tlhIngan Hol vIjatlhaHbe’,"" or, ""I cannot speak Klingon.""

, This translates into, ""Today is a good day to die,"" and is a valued phrase in Klingon culture.

, The phrase translates into, ""We are Klingons!"" Similarly, you can use ""tlhIngan jIH"" to state simply, ""I am a Klingon.""

, Every race needs an occasional bathroom break, and Klingons are no exception. If you cannot locate the nearest restroom at the next convention you head to, you can ask a Klingon-speaking Trekkie this phrase, which translates into ""Where is the bathroom?""

, Roughly translated, it means, ""What time is it?"" More literally translated, it means, ""How many times has it been heard?""

, This translates into, ""Your mother has a smooth forehead!"" Klingons are known for their forehead ridges, and stating that one's mother has no such ridges is considered a very strong insult.

, Translated into English, the phrase means, ""Fire the torpedoes!""

, The phrase translates into, ""Where is a good restaurant?""

, If you want to sit next to a Trekkie whom you are not formally acquainted with, you could use the phrase to ask them ""Is this seat taken?""

, It could also be spelled ""p'tahk,"" ""pahtk,"" ""pahtak"" or ""p'tak."" The term is a common insult that has no direct translation into English, but roughly translates into ""fool,"" ""coward,"" or ""dishonorable person."" Use it to describe someone who lacks Warrior Spirit.

Research the Disney vault system.,
Memorize the movies in the vault.,
Keep a spreadsheet of the vault schedule.",How to Keep Track of the Disney Vault1," Disney’s vault system means putting certain movies on a moratorium so that they are not available for purchase or digital viewing until they are released from the vault. Generally, Disney puts movies in a seven-year vault hold and then releases them. Disney’s reasoning behind the release is that every seven years a new generation of 2 - 7 year old children comes of age and is ready to enjoy the films. Generally, two movies are released a year.Others believe that Disney’s vault system was created to create a scarcity. Because the scarcity encourages people to rush out and buy the DVDs and Blu-ray disks when they are released, since they’re not available all the time.;
, Not every movie goes in and out the vault system, and you have to know which movies you should be tracking to keep track of the vault. Currently, the movies included in the vault system are the following:Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Pinocchio, Fantasia, Dumbo, Bambi ,Cinderella, Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan, Lady and the Tramp, Sleeping Beauty, One Hundred and One Dalmatians, The Jungle Book. The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and The Lion King. Basically, it’s all the classics., Write down the name of the movie, its theater release date and DVD release dates. Also, track digital releases such as releases to iTunes and Amazon. When you purchase the rights or redeem a Digital HD Copy through Disney Movie Anywhere (DMA) you can continue to view your purchased titles even when they return to the vault and are no longer available to purchase. Track Diamond Editions, Special Releases and Blu-ray releases. They don’t usually release DVDs, Blu-rays and digital releases at the same time. So, you have to keep track.


For instance, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was last released on Diamond Edition on October 6,2009 and in a DVD set on November 24,2009. However it was not released digitally or on Blu-ray. It went into the vault April 3rd, 2011 and is expected to be re-released on Blu-ray on February 2nd 2016 and on Digital HD and Disney Movies anywhere January 19th 2016 under the Signature collection.
Review disney.wikia.com to gather some Intel on the current movies in vault to get a head start on your spreadsheet.Another item to include in your chart is anticipated releases. Generally, Disney releases two movies from the vault a year. So, calculate when the movie went into vault by adding seven years. Then, include a column for anticipated releases.
For instance, Peter Pan went into the vault on April 30, 2014, so it is not expected to be released until 2021."

Join a Klingon language group.,
Listen to the language.After you have learned the alphabet and a few of the words, look up videos on the Internet or purchase audio CDs or DVDs of experts speaking Klingon.,
Get a Klingon language dictionary.,
Download a Klingon font.Even though you can spell out and read Klingon using the standard Latin alphabet, strictly speaking, there are separate characters used to represent those letters and sounds.,
Read works written in Klingon.",How to Speak Klingon2," The most thorough and well-known group is The Klingon Language Institute,but you can also find other fan groups by doing an Internet search. Access the free information provided by these groups to determine if you are really interested in learning the language. Some of these groups also offer official membership, which will provide you with greater access to more information and events.

, In this way, you can learn Klingon by example. Audio files will allow you to listen to how Klingon words need to be pronounced, and video files will help you see how the mouth needs to be formed in order to produce such sounds.

, You can purchase one online or at a bookstore, or you can find a dictionary free for download. A Klingon language dictionary will work like most other language dictionaries. Most will have a Klingon to English section as well as an English to Klingon section, so that you will be able to translate terms and phrases both ways.

, You can brush up on these letters by researching more online and in Klingon language books. Once you feel comfortable with the new alphabet, you can download a font that uses this alphabet for any digital Klingon communications you need to make.

, A good way to practice any language is to get plenty of practice reading it. You can download or purchase books, magazines, poems, and short stories written in Klingon. Some of these books even include works previously written in other languages. Or you can read books translated from the original Klingon, like Shakespearean plays.

Document current releases.,
Document the releases of new movies.,
Calculate a rough estimate.",How to Keep Track of the Disney Vault2," If you take note of the movies that are currently released, then you can anticipate when they are going in the vault and when they might be re-released. Take note of Disney commercials advertising limited-time offers for movie purchases. Those offers really are limited.


For instance, if a commercial says only available until July 2015, then that really is the case. After that date, you won’t be able to purchase it for a while.

, New Disney movies such as Frozen are not currently in a vault because they’re new, but if the movie sells well it probably will be placed on the limited-release list. Frozen, for instance, did sell well and it wasn't released in Blu-ray, so it likely will go into a vault and won’t be available in that format for a while.

, Research when a movie was released. If you want to track when a movie will be re-released take note of the last time it was released. If you don’t know, then start with its original movie release date. Add two years for DVD production after the original movie release, then assume it went into the vault for seven years. This might not give you an exact release date, but it gives you a good estimate of when it will be released.


Let’s say Sleeping Beauty is to go into the vault in 2016, but you don’t know that. Research the original release date, which is 1959. Assume it’s available for two years for purchase. Then assume another seven years in the vault. Assume another 2 years for release out of the vault. Continue doing this up until present day. It will look like this. 1959+2 = 1961 ( Release) The movie is released until 1961. Then it goes back into the vault for seven years until 1968. 1961 + 7 = 1968 ( Vault) In 1968, it is released out of the vault for two years until 1970. Then, it goes back into the vault for another 7 years until 1977. If you keep this up until present day, you’ll find that the movie is released in 2013, which means it would go back into vault in 2015.
In actuality, it goes back into vault in 2016, and if you adjust for the month and date, you can get an even more accurate release date. Nevertheless, just by using the year of the original release date, you can get really close to guesstimating the vault release dates.

"
"
Research the Disney websites.,
Expect milestone anniversary release dates.,
Pay attention to current events and anticipate releases for special circumstances.",How to Keep Track of the Disney Vault3," Disney has a website for almost of its Diamond Edition releases. So, you can check out the website for release information. Also, research Disney’s press releases. They provide ample information on special releases and release dates.There are also some websites that track some of the Disney release dates such as disney.wiki.com. Make sure websites such as these are bookmarked in your browser.

, For instance, Peter Pan was just released in 2013 for its 60th anniversary. Anticipate that Disney will release certain movies from the vault to celebrate milestone anniversaries such as 10th, 20th, 30th and 50th anniversaries. Sleeping Beauty, for instance, was released in 2014 to celebrate its 55th anniversary.


To track milestone anniversaries, just add the appropriate number to the original release date. Sleeping Beauty, for instance, will celebrate it’s 60th anniversary in 2019. So perhaps it will be released from the vault prematurely; it’s not scheduled to be released until 2023.
In 2006, Disney released Bambi from the vault for 70 days in celebration of it 70th anniversary of when Disney began work on the movie., Take note of Walt Disney’s birthday -- the creator of Disney. His favorite movie, such as Bambi, could be released around his birthday to celebrate. Also, pay attention to current events with actors who performed in Disney movies.


For instance, after Robin Williams’ death, Disney released Aladdin from the vault because Williams played the beloved genie in the movie.

Connect everything up.,
Learn how to record a sound from an input line and how to arrange pre-recorded sounds.,
Select a room in your house.,
Start writing simple tracks.,
If you have trouble with any of the above, pick up a Mixing / Studio Book.,
Once you've learned the basics, start breaking it down.",How to Build a Home Studio for Computer Based Music Recording1," Do you want to build a recording studio? Is it a singing booth? Is it an engineering booth? Is it for computer-based music production? Knowing what you want before you start can help you decide which equipment you will need. Doing extensive research will help at this stage. Try to find a specialist at PC World, or your local Apple shop, take notes and then find more information on the Internet.;
, This will include such items as amplifiers, microphones, mixers, electric instruments, cables for connecting it all together. A modern computer built or purchased within the past three years should be sufficient.


If possible, acquire a working high-quality soundcard, such as an M-Audio Fast Track Pro or Digidesign Mbox 2 Mini. Creative Labs does have a Pro Music line called EMU. A 1212M PCI system is ideal if you were going to go that route.
Monitor speakers are helpful if you are looking to stick with this for more than a hobby. The M-Audio Studiophile BX8a's, KRK RP-8 Rokit work well, and if you've got money to burn, the Mackie HR824 Studio Monitors.
If you're into hip-hop, techno, or dance music, a set of turntables will be needed to record your sets or scratches on the fly. You can also use DJ software such as Traktor or Serato and a USB DJ controller to try out your mixes.
A midi keyboard will be useful if you want to use midi software (which you can use to write bass lines, piano parts, and drum beats). Nothing fancy is needed, but each person will have their own preference. There are many advantages to having a midi keyboard because it will give you the tactile feel of a real instrument, which can greatly aid creativity.

,, This is where most of the genius (and perspiration!) comes in. In general, keep it as simple as possible. For best playback quality run from the sound card into a mixer or amplifier and then to your monitor speakers. For best recording quality, run instruments/mics into a mixer(make sure you are getting a perfect signal) then run from the mixer into the sound card.

, Also learn how to turn an arrangement into a .wav or .mp3 file. (After all, eventually we want to make a CD with all this awesome music!)

, Sound-proof it if possible. If not, try to use special carpet or insulation that can at least reduce external noise.

, Start off with a drumbeat. Add a bass line or piano or vocal track. Start mixing. Explore! It's all about experimentation. At the beginning, you don't have to write a masterpiece - just focus on having fun!

, It will help you understand the underlying concepts needed to keep you going for a lifetime.

, Lay a bunch of tracks together. Experiment with processed effects. Experiment with plugins, loops, new hardware and anything else you can get your hands onto.

Understand the person who has the collection.,
Don't assume you are right.,
Be familiar with movies.,
Immediately look for a predominant genre in the collection.,
Take note of odd balls.,
Scan and question.,
Be open minded.,
Judgement is personal.,
Have fun!",How to Judge a Person Through Their Movie Collection," All people are different, and judging someone based on their movie collection requires a lot and a little. The point of judging however, is to gain insight into a person's subconscious or to tell you more about them that you may not currently know, or that he/she may not even know about themselves.;
, Movies can be given as gifts, be borrowed, or are someone else's--therefore, do not assume that every movie is an indication of what type of person you are dealing with or what their interests/deepest darkest thoughts are.

, To judge, you have to know what you are judging. Movies you have never heard of should be filed away in your memory to look up later.

, Action, drama, comedy, romance, etc. The larger number usually is a good indication of what the person prefers to purchase or watch in their down time.

, If a movie or several strike you as completely out of the ordinary, you can always ask in a casual way. This is when you can determine if the movie was a gift, belongs to someone else, or is loved by another person in the household. Again, don't assume too much and don't state your question as if you already know the answer.

, Now, as you read the list-your first thoughts are subconsciously ""Have I seen this movie?"" Going with that, you can decide whether or not you liked it. If you liked it or loved it, a strong sense of amusement or fondness may occur. Maybe even a slight head nod. If it is one of your all-time favorite movies, you may immediately ""forgive"" any other movie you deem ""unacceptable."" The next question to ask if you haven't seen a movie is ""Have I heard about it?""...Immediately your next though is ""Yes, so and so said it sucked..."" If it is a close friend who's opinion you respect and you both generally agree about things, especially all matters intellectual, chances are you will probably think it sucks as well if you saw it. Take note of that and move on.

, Judging requires you approach a collection with an open mind, taking into account all the variables mentioned previously. Some movies ""overlap"" and there is usually a story behind what a person thinks or feels about each and every movie they possess. Note that not everyone can explain why they like some of the movies they own...this is where judgement comes in.

, Your judgement is YOUR opinions and thoughts. Judgement of a person based on movies is considered by most, an inaccurate measurable tool, therefore, you may not receive other people's support of your assumptions or thoughts. Save your judgements for a close friend or relative later, not to the person's face or to someone who you think will agree with you but unsure of. You may end up saying something offensive unintentionally.

, Judgement does not always have to be negative. If you see a lot of movies you like from a collection and feel you can ask that person about them, you may realize you have a lot in common. Or better yet-realize something else about a movie that you didn't notice before, a scene, character, some history about the actors, etc. Also, if there are movies you are interested in and the conversation/s have been positive for the most part, you may even start by letting the person borrow one of your movies, and you borrow one of theirs. This way you can continue to get to know one another and share new thoughts and insights about topics the movies address.

You'll be engaged in your Potter-viewing mission for about 20 hours, likely longer with breaks, so you'll want to be sure that everyone has a comfortable seat and a clear view of the screen., You could simply choose a day on the weekend when your friends are free to host your party, or you might want to pick a date that references the Harry Potter universe. For example, you might have your party on September third at 4:00 PM, since Harry boards the Hogwarts express on platform 9 (September is the ninth month) and ¾. (which represents the third day at four o'clock)., Twenty hours is a long time to watch anything, even something that you love. You might want to split your marathon into two days and do a half marathon each day, or you might only want to marathon your favorite movies. In any case, write down your general viewing schedule, so you can tell your friends the start and end time of your marathon.


You can add some fun and imagination to your marathon by also making it a theme party.
For true, diehard fans who plan on watching the entire series from beginning to end, you should plan a sleepover party. Otherwise, you may have trouble fitting 20 hours of viewing into a single day.

, Sitting for long periods of time without moving can be bad for your heath. Think of Harry Potter themed activities you might do to stretch out your body between viewings. This might include:


Pretend dueling
Muggle quidditch
A Potterverse based board game
Potter themed charades or pictionary
Potter themed online quizzes

, Due to the combined length of the movies, you'll have to start watching early in the day and end late at night. You might even need to continue watching until the morning of the following day. Include your viewing schedule for your guests on your Potter themed invitation, and don't forget to include the address for the party, the time it starts and ends, and whether or not there will be refreshments.


If you're trying to plan your party on a budget, you might consider making your party a potluck, where everyone brings a dish to pass. This should be clearly indicated on your invitations.Write your invitations on yellowed, parchment style paper so your invites imitate mail in the Potterverse. Purchase this paper at your local craft store or at an art supply store.
Use pictures that reference Harry Potter in your invitations. For example, since owls deliver mail in the wizarding world, you might include the picture of an owl on your invitation.

, You don't want hunger pangs to interrupt your epic marathon! Think about some popular treats served in the wizarding world, and then do some research online to find recipes for these. You might serve butterbeer or pumpkin juice as drinks, and for food you might prepare golden snitch cupcakes or Bertie Botts strange flavored jellybeans. You might make:Homemade butterbeer
Treacle tart
Cauldron cakes
Pumpkin juice

, If you don't have any of the Harry Potter movies, or if you are missing some of them, you'll have to purchase or rent the missing DVDs. Check for scratches ahead of time and give each movie a test run before the day of your party. It would be disappointing if you made it most of the way through your marathon and then had to stop due to a damaged disk or corrupted digital file.


If you're missing one of the Harry Potter movies in your collection, you might ask one of your friends to bring the movie to the party. That way you can focus on getting ready!

, When your marathon day finally arrives, put the first movie on your TV and allow it to play for a few minutes to check the volume. After you've adjusted the volume to a good level, pause the movie at the beginning so all you have to do is push ""play."", Disposable cups, paper plates, and a few rolls of paper towel can make clean up easier when your marathon's through.You can even buy cups and plates decorated with Harry Potter designs. These should be available at your local grocery or dollar store, though if you have difficulty finding Potterverse themed products, an online retailer might be your best bet.

, Depending on the recipes you've found, or depending on your favorite Potterverse treats, you may need to buy additional supplies from your local grocery store. Once your treats are made, arrange your snacks in a way that mimics the movie, like arranging food on a long table like.


Organize your treats on a rolling cart and pretend during food breaks that you're riding the Hogwarts Express!
Have backup treats ready so that when you've finished one you don't have to interrupt viewing.

, You don't need to go over the top, but small details will certainly add to the atmosphere. If you plan on playing muggle quidditch you'll need brooms for players, and these could be stacked off to the side as decorations in the meantime. Posters from the movies can be taped to walls, butterbeer served in an intricate looking carafe or coffee press, and the books can be placed around the viewing area to give your home some Potter flair., These can be something that you send your guests on their way with once the party is done, or maybe you'll want to give these to your friends when they arrive as a way of saying thanks for coming. To make your goody-bags more authentic, you might include:


Chocolate coins wrapped in gold foil
Mini creatures, like spiders, frogs, and dragons
A ""potion"" that's really a juice box

, You'll want your space to be as comfortable and as easy to move around in as possible. Move furniture that is blocks walkways or takes up unnecessary space, and bring extra seating from other rooms if you are able.If you are worried you won't have enough seating, you might make a cozy nest with blankets and pillows in front of your TV.

, Even if you don't have a CD of the soundtrack from one of the Harry Potter movies, you can still stream tracks from YouTube, Pandora, or other online media providers. This will get your guests into the mood to marathon watch Harry Potter from start to finish., This may be as simple as having your guests choose a strip of paper with one of the four Hogwarts houses written on it from a ""Sorting Hat."" Or you might do something more elaborate, like have each guest that's arrived duel the next guest to arrive.If dueling, you might want to write up a cheat sheet for duelists that has offensive and defensive spells listed.

, After you've sorted your guests according to house, you can award points to each house for good things done and trivia known. Use a spare piece of parchment style paper leftover from your invitations, if you have any, and keep track of house points to make things fun. You might award points for:


Quoting lines with the movie
Knowing obscure movie facts
Pointing out errors and mistakes

, Unplanned breaks might happen over the course of your marathon, but each of those will add time to your already 20 hour long journey through the Potterverse. Be sure food is conveniently placed so that your guests can eat as they get hungry.


Stopping to prepare food can put you behind in your viewing schedule. Have pre-made food ready to go in your refrigerator, or plan in advance to order in once the snacks are gone.

, Stand up and really stretch yourself out every hour or so to prevent yourself from becoming uncomfortable. Sitting for extended periods of time is bad for your health, but taking five to moving around and stretch out every 30 minutes to an hour can relieve many of these problems., As you and your guests graze on the goodies you've set out, you'll have to clear off empty dishes and bring out more food as necessary. Use your scheduled break times to top off your Bertie Botts jellybeans or replenish your cauldron cakes."

Examine the type of rights you can purchase, and decide which are best for your particular use.,
Determine whether you want the rights to an existing recorded version or the rights to re-record it.,
Decide how much of the music you plan to use, and note the exact timing -- including at which second in the recording your use will start and stop, if you’re buying rights to the recording.,
Think about where you will show your production.,
Locate the music’s publishers and visit their website for contact information.,
Contact the publishers to inquire about obtaining the rights you need, including all information about how you will use the music and the type of rights you’re seeking.

,
Wait for a response from each publisher, which can take 6 to 8 weeks.",How to Buy Music Rights,"


Most people who buy music rights opt for theatrical or full rights, which allow you to use the music in a film without restriction.
Television rights allow you to use the music in a television production and can change in price according to the exact nature of the program.
Video rights allow you to use the music in a video as opposed to a publicly-screened film.
Rights for the Internet allow you to use the music on Web sites, software and CD-ROM.
Non-theatre rights allow you to use the presentation in a non-public context, such as at a conference or a festival and are the least expensive to obtain.;
,


The rights to re-record the music are cheaper than the rights to use the recording. However, if you want to use the music in a film, for example, and you don’t have access to a professional band and a recording studio, it may be worth it to use the original.

, If you’re using a short clip of the music rather than the entire piece, the rights are less expensive to purchase.


At the same time, decide the length of time that the music will play. For example, you may decide to use the music only once, or you may decide to use the same clip more than once.

, For example, if you’re using a piece of music in a local stage production, the rights will be less expensive than if you’re using it in a film that you plan to show in North America and Europe.

, If you have a copy of the CD, you can usually find the publisher’s information printed on its cover. If you don’t have the CD, visit the websites of major music publishing companies, such as ASCAP, BMI and SESAC. There, you can search for the music by title, songwriter or performing artist and locate the publishers that way.

,, If a publisher rejects your rights request or if the price for the rights you initially requested is too high, contact the publisher to see whether you have any other options, or whether you should find a different piece of music.

, Is an actor in a period film wearing a modern watch? Look for things like that to take your mind off the scariness.

, If you're watching it in a movie theater, grip your seat tightly.

, We watch scary movies for the thrill, but afterwards, it's a nightmare. If you know that you are easily scared, just don't watch it.

Read about the movie before you watch it.,

Go to the bathroom before starting the movie, especially if it's at night.,
Gather together some pillows and blankets to make a cozy area or even a fort.,
Watch it with someone else.,
Peek rather than watch.,
Cover your eyes during the scary parts.,
Peek through your fingers slowly, and then cover your eyes again.

Keep saying to yourself, ""This is not real!"",
Watch the commercials on how the movies were made.,
When there is suspenseful music playing, brace yourself.",How to Watch a Horror Movie," This can help you to know what it's about and what others have thought of it. You can read reviews to see what others have to say about it and how many stars they rate it. And if you don't mind spoilers, you can read a synopsis of the film. For some people, knowing what will happen reduces the fear but not the thrill because it helps take the edge off.


Try looking up the plot on Wikipedia or IMDB (Internet Movie Database) beforehand if you don't mind spoiling the movie for yourself. It helps to know what happens when, so if you think you might get scared by that part, go to the bathroom or get a refill on snacks.;
, Perhaps the content is not of interest to you or maybe the reviews have canned the film and it seems a waste of time. Or, perhaps the reviews are glowing and you're keen to find out more. Decide whether or not you want to watch the horror movie.

, A way to stop getting scared is by watching the non-gory ones first, the ones with a great deal of suspense, and slowly move into the most frightening and gory ones. Keep in mind that gory does not mean scary and the movies are not necessarily scarier when they're gorier. Some horror movies without blood are actually scarier than some of the really gory horror movies.

, If it is dark you may not want to have to wander the halls alone.

, Having some comfort objects might help you to feel safer and will provide something for you to clench if the movie gets especially scary for you.

, There's no need to be trialing this alone!


Never watch alone if the movie is really scary. Watch it with people like your family members or friends. This will help.

, If you're really scared, you can watch the movie through your fingers.

, Or, turn away.

,, Reminding yourself that it's just a movie with special effects (and sometimes a bad script) can help you to remember that it's just a gory play on film and not reality.


Try laughing at all the unrealistic parts. For example: Bad effects for blood, unrealistic bodies, fake fear, dumb-looking monsters, etc.

, Notice how the scenes were created so you can know how unreal the movie really is. This can help prepare you for future horror movies too.

, Something loud, horrific and gory is probably going to happen.

Decide if you really want to watch it.,
Remember that you are just watching a movie.,
The first time you watch a horror movie, make sure it's not so terrible, and watch it with a person who is not as terrified as you.,
Sit comfortably because you might jump when something pops out, and you don't want to be uncomfortable.,
Don't create a scary atmosphere.,
Before you start watching, remember that during the movie, you will have strong emotions.,
Press play.

,
Don't try fake yelling.,
Breathe normally.

,
Try to remember all the steps mentioned above.

Make sure you have access to the remote control to stop the movie when you can.,
Comment on funny parts of the movie.,
Take breaks when you come a suspenseful part.,
After the movie, watch relaxing TV program.,
If the movie did not result so terribly scary, laugh about yourself being so scared!

,
If the movie scared you a lot, and is tormenting you day after day and won't make you sleep, talk to someone you trust and remember - it is just a movie.

",How to Watch a Horror Movie Without Getting Scared," Watching a movie is a way to relax and have fun, not a torture. Nobody can force you.
, Even if the movie is based on true events, remember that it is probably based on what little event or what someone believed would happen in this ""true event"".

, Make sure that person will not torment you afterwards. For example, many people watch it with their older siblings which sometimes, wouldn't be the best idea. Also, we know that some people say that PG-13 movies are less scary - well, that is not always the case. Take The Grudge or Insidious both known as two of the scariest movies. Try something that isn't extreme - get introduced to the horror genre by maybe seeing comedy-horror or drama-horror. Look for that other genre that interests you that you can combine with horror.

, Hug the person you are watching the movie if you can. Anyway, you should have the possibility to establish a physical contact with this person. Have pillows and blankets to hug too!

, Even though some horror fans may want to watch movies in the dark with surround sound, you definitely should not do that if you are afraid of being scared. Watch movies in the daytime, turn on the lights, open the window to let sunlight in. Also, avoid surround sound, because it sends you all the background suspenseful music louder than the actual people talking.

, Scary movies are made for suspense, so you will not relax totally.

,, It tends to make you even more jumpy.

,,, Pausing the movie helps remind you that it is just a movie.

, Laugh about things, or funny faces, or anything.

, Get yourself some food and a drink; this is very useful. Read a short advertisement in the newspaper, check your mailbox for mail, or play a quick game of sudoku. This can divert your mind from the movie temporarily so you can continue watching it.

, Do not stay in a room alone or read something related to horror. If possible, discuss the movie with someone. Another awesome thing to do is go to the ""Special ""Features"" in the main menu and look at how everything was so fake.

Relax -- know that the jumps are coming without worrying about them.,
Be ready for at least one jump scare within the first 30 minutes.,
Know the audio cues commonly set before a jump scare.,
Keep an eye on unnaturally empty spaces in the frame.,
Be aware immediately after any ""false"" scares.,
Watch more and more horror movies to get desensitize the urge to jump.,
Check out a site like WheresTheJump.com for a comprehensive list of jump scares.",How to Stop 'Jumping' During a Horror Movie1," Paradoxically, just knowing when a jump scare will likely occur may make you more likely to jump. That's because people start to fixate on the idea of the scare coming up, giving it their full attention as their fear mounts. But this is what a horror director wants -- you are focusing on the fear, just like the characters. When the jump eventually surprises you, you are so tuned into the moment that the scare hits you with twice the power.


Try not to let the fear of an upcoming jump scare bother you -- just tell yourself that one is coming and stop worrying about it.
The following steps detail ways to see jump scares coming, helping you anticipate scare. Instead of watching for these signals with dread, think like a filmmaker -- ask ""how do these effects work to build tension"", and not ""when does the tension finally release?"";
, This may seem like a broad assertion, but it stems from the larger artistic reason to use jump scares in a film. Horror is a genre that manipulates fear and tension, trying to grow this fear slowly throughout the movie so it all culminates in one big scare or set piece (like the reveal of the monster). To do so, directors use small scares to get your adrenaline pumping. This puts you in frazzled, tense state, which makes more complex or psychological scares easier to pull off later on.


Think of each jump scare as a horror director's early ""brush strokes"" and you'll be better equipped to handle them.

, Silence is the most common, but it usually comes right after a long, slow, and ominous swell in the music. Remember that jump scare work by hitting you with an image or sound very abruptly and quickly, not by slowly ratcheting things up. Thus a scare almost always comes right after a lull or moment of quiet -- this makes the loudness of the scare extra noticeable and frightening.

, If a character is leaning in the bottom of the screen and there is a big space of blackness or an empty room behind them, be ready for that frame to fill. The director is knowingly drawing your eye to that space and hoping that you'll dread the idea of it getting filled. Instead of sitting and waiting for the jump to occur, recognize that they are simply moving your eye to the place they are about to scare you. It's the oldest trick in horror cinematography -- but an easy on to see.


Note that some modern directors are adept at keeping the screen blank the first few times to lull you into a false sense of security.

, A cheap but common trick is to ramp up the music and suspense before a dramatic moment (like opening a dark hallway door), then show absolutely nothing scary. More often than not, this moment of relaxation is simply used to lull you into a false sense of security -- the real scare is coming shortly afterward.


Any scene that spends its time building or establishing tension will try and pay off in some way -- rarely do directors put you on the edge of your seat but give you nothing to ""do"" once you get there. Be on the lookout for this rising tension.

, The best way to get over jumping during horror movies is to jump a lot during horror movies. The more horror you know and see, the less likely it is that any particular movie or moment will be able to scare you. Horror has a lot of great qualities, but plot originality is not frequently one of them. The more you know, the more you'll be able to successfully anticipate.


Horror or thrilling video games are a great way to get used to jump scares as well, because they require you to not only react but also do something with your reaction (like shoot the bad guy) that helps you learn to stay calm., While they don't have every movie ever, they feature just about every movie you could want to watch. Furthermore, they have ratings on how ""jump-heavy"" each movie is, and some films have subtitle files that you can download that will warn you 2-3 seconds before a jump scare is coming. While it may sound like overkill, it is one of the best ways to completely avoid jumping."

Watch the trailer so you know what's coming.,
Read a plot summary.,
Research the actors.,
Watch parodies of the movie.,
Learn about horror movie costumes and makeup.,
Know the classic scary movie tropes.",How to Survive a Horror Movie1," If you know what movie you're going to be watching, look up the trailer online and watch it from start to finish. Trailers are usually no more than three or four minutes long, and they contain highlights from the film. If you can get through the trailer, you'll be familiar with the plot, characters and setting, so there will be fewer surprises when you watch the movie. When it comes to horror movies, the fewer surprises, the better.;
, In this case, spoilers are a good thing! Read all about the plot twists so you won't have to anticipate them when you watch the movie. When you already know how a movie ends, some of the magic and power is taken away. Read about who's going to die, who the killer is and what creepy twists you should brace yourself for.

, Find out what other movies the stars of the horror movie are also in. If the guy who plays the psycho killer played a friendly dad in a different movie, watch clips of the dad character. Do the same for all the other actors in the movie. When it comes time to watch the movie, you'll remember them as they were in their other, friendlier roles, and they won't seem as scary.

, If you're watching a classic horror movie, there are bound to be plenty of parodies. See if you can find a Saturday Night Live sketch making fun of the movie. If SNL didn't do one, look on YouTube to see if another comedy group might have done one. When you watch the actual movie, you'll remember the parody, and the movie will seem silly., One thing that makes watching horror movies so uncomfortable is seeing the blood and gore. The thing to remember is that it's all fake. Fake bones, fake skin, fake stitches, fake blood. Creating bloody costuming that looks realistic actually requires a lot of skill. When you learn about how the costumes and makeup were put together, you'll be able to watch the movie with a sense of fascination instead of horror., Certain things happen over and over again in horror movies, to the point where many horror movies are quite predictable. Learning the tropes can help to take away the movie's mystery and make it much more watchable. Here are a few examples of classic scary movie tropes:A babysitter goes upstairs to check on the kids, only to find a killer up there
There's a murderer on the loose at summer camp
An old, abandoned house turns out to be haunted
A creepy looking child turns out to be a ghost

Recognize common formula used in 99% of horror films to get past the tension in them.,
Watch horror films with an eye for style over substance.,
Remember that the best horror movies are the ones that subvert, not conform, to your expectations.,
Know that your jumping or flinching is an evolutionary advantage worth keeping around.",How to Stop 'Jumping' During a Horror Movie2," Horror movies are a particularly formulaic genre, as anyone who has watched a lot of horror can attest. This means, however, that astute viewers can usually piece together the general arc of action and suspense. While this may ""ruin"" the scares a bit, it helps you realize that the scares in horror aren't real -- they are manufactured in a very similar way to get a very similar response from all viewers:



First is a scene meant to scare you immediately, such as the first victim or the release of the ""evil"" at the heart of the film.

Second comes establishment of characters and locations. This is usually the place of the first jump scare -- not the real villain or scare, but something to put you on edge.

Third comes the first death or scare, while people think things are still ""normal"" in the horror world. The jump scare usually coincides with this death, if there is one.

Fourth comes the worst/scariest part of the film -- the bodies mount up and the characters slowly realize that things are not looking good. Expect 1-2 more jump scares.

Fifth and finally comes the defeat of the villain (or is it?!), and this section is usually more action-heavy than the rest. There may be 1-2 jump scares, but they are usually easy to see coming., Because most horror films follow cookie-cutter plots, this isn't where most directors look for inspiration or originality. Horror is a very stylized, unrealistic genre that takes great creative leaps in lighting, costume design, sound/music, and theme in order to stay relevant. Most horror connoisseurs don't watch horror to get scared all of the time, they watch it to enjoy great artists pushing an extreme and stylish genre to its limits, all while serving up a delicious shot of adrenaline.



Cinematography in horror films is extreme and artistic. Pay attention to the lights and common colors, crazy camera angles, and interesting jumps or cuts.

Social themes are common motifs in horror, exploring what society fears through art. From Night of the Living Dead to It Follows, look for the real-life metaphors.

Sound and Music are subtle but key. It's been shown that sound on its own is often scarier than pure visuals. Anyone who's ever been alone at night in a creaky house knows that, but ask yourself how the filmmakers are able to pull off this same effect in the movie., A truly great horror movie is scary because you never see the events and scares coming. While all horror films will follow the ""rules"" outlined above to various degrees, you should be prepared for a great horror flick to break these rules in crucial, terrifying ways. The best way to avoid jumping, at the end of the day, is to never watch horror movies in the first place. But what is the fun in that?!

, You may get annoyed at how easily you flinch during a jump scare, even one that you see coming, but there is a very good reason for the jump. Almost all mammals share this ""startle reflex,"" as it naturally moves you away from potential danger without having to take the time to think of it. Even if it's not fun, it is hardwired into human DNA to move when scared."
"
See if you can watch it with the lights on.,
Imagine the crew behind every scene.,
Narrate the movie during the scary parts.,
Laugh at the scary parts.",How to Survive a Horror Movie2," When the lights are low, it's easier to believe that a monster with a chainsaw could come up from behind and surprise you. With the lights on, you can take a break from looking at the screen and look at the lint on the carpet or watch your cat scratching his post. Tell your friends you'd like to watch the movie with a few lights turned on.

, This little trick can be done in a theater or at home, and it instantly takes away the movie's power. So, you're watching a disgustingly creepy scene where a clown monster chases a little girl up some stairs? Picture a group of people with cameras capturing it all on film. It's not so scary when you realize that behind every single scene is an entire crew of people: camera operators, lighting operators, other actors, and so on. Picture the director telling the actors what to do. ""Run up two stairs, look behind you, scream, then keep running. More feeling this time."" It'll help the scenes lose their potency.

, Yell at the screen when things get too scary. If you've ever watched a horror movie in a theater, you've probably noticed people doing this. ""She's opening the door. She's going in! No, don't go in there!"" There seems to be a universal agreement that it's OK to talk during horror movies. If you're in a home setting with some die-hard fans, you may annoy them, but that's the price they should have to pay for making you watch a horror movie.

, Horror movies are often pretty hilarious. Aliens pop out of people's stomachs, hideous trolls end up fighting each other instead of killing their prey, and so on. Spot the comedic moments, which are sometimes the scariest, and laugh out loud. After all, the point of watching a movie is to be entertained.

"
"
Make sure your friends don't leave the room.,
Cover your eyes and ears when necessary.,
Have a ""safe"" signal with a friend.,
Leave if you really aren't enjoying it.",How to Survive a Horror Movie3," You don't want to end up watching a horror movie all by yourself. Even though you logically know it isn't real, it can still deeply scare you if your mind gets too involved. If horror movies truly scare you, only watch with friends. Try not to watch with the types of friends who'll use your fear against you later by jumping out of closets and grabbing you from behind.

, What you can't see or hear can't hurt you. When you can't stand what's on the screen, close your eyes and put your head in your lap and press your hands over your ears.

, If you want to ensure that you won't open your eyes too soon, have a friend poke you when it's safe to look. Again, do not employ a trickster type who will intentionally poke you right when a violent stabbing is occurring.

, No one is forcing you to watch the movie (hopefully), so just get up and leave if you hate it. Wait in a well-lit room for the thing to end so you don't have to endure another second. If you hate horror movies so much that you can't stand to watch them, that's nothing to be ashamed of. It just means you're sensitive to pain and violence and have great empathy for your fellow humans. Tell this to your friends if they give you a hard time.

Remember this not real.,
Watch something peaceful, funny, or nice afterward.,
Remember, the movie industry invested tons of effort in making their movies ""real"".,

You're no less safe than you were before. Keep in mind that all the scary things you just viewed were most likely computer effects or something similar. Remind yourself that it is not real.;
, Like 50 First Dates, or The Wedding Planner, or some chick-flick! Try comedies as well- they will make you laugh and lift your mood.

, Just keep remembering those are live actors and actresses, and nothing horrid can or did really happen, try to imagine the director suddenly yelling cut! Then then actor/actress taking off their mask and saying ""What the heck. What now?"" It helps you to realize that it is all just made up.

,,, Hang out with a friend, or be around family.

, Try to point out how it is impossible, and if the scary things did exist, why would they target you in particular?

, Each time, make the scene less scary. For example, maybe the killer just jumped out of nowhere and killed someone. Think of when the killer stabbed the person. Next time, make them be poking them with a stick, next time they can be cat fighting etc. Each time just make it funnier. Pretty soon it will be hilarious! You won't be scared at all. Do this with each scary scene that has left you scared. Next time you watch the movie, you may be laughing your head off while everyone else is shaking in fear!

, You will find that seeing how the movie was made will take a lot away from its scariness.

, ""Oh yeah, talk to the creepy stranger in a trench coat wearing a black hat- he'll be so nice!""

, It is another attempt to give the movie scarier realism.

, It'll remind you that it's all in your head.

, Why would it happen now? Why would zombies suddenly exist just after you watched a zombie movies and not before? And why would the zombies or monster just so happen to be in your town?

If you were watching the movie alone, go and socialize with the rest of the family, you will feel safe and comforted.

,
Sometimes, although it sounds strange, you will be drawn to watch the movie again because it was scary.,
If you think you can cope, watch the movie over and over and over and over.,
Discuss the film with friends and family.,
Hopefully, and remember it will take time, you will overcome your fear.,
Watch a family movie after the scary movie, if you have time.",How to Not Get Freaked out After a Scary Movie," Avoid storing it near your bedroom, as come night, you will not stop thinking about it, keep glancing at it, and will feel as if the fear from the movie is returning. If things get really bad, sell or destroy the DVD entirely.;
,, This may be good sign, as it probably means you were entertained/scared rather than just scared.

, You will get severely bored, but the scary parts will become dull from constantly seeing them. Do not stop watching until the movie becomes unbearably boring.

, The chances are your parents will have watched it too and will offer support and comfort.

, Unless the movie was absolutely terrifying, the chances are your memories will fade away, and in a few years you will have forgotten what it was about altogether.

, This will make the night (if watching at night) seem more fun. If watching by day, a funny comedy or romance just takes your mind off the scary movie.

Acknowledge the things you are scared of.,
Talk about your fears.,
Be logical about what frightens you.,
Overcome your fears.,
View the movie bloopers.",How to Go to Bed After Watching a Horror Movie1," After watching a horror movie, you may be worried about zombies, ghosts, serial killers, or a myriad of frightening things. Think about what it scares you, and acknowledge the things that you fear. Recognizing what is making you scared can help you deal with that fear logically.For example, you may be afraid of someone breaking into your home, or you may be afraid of being haunted by a ghost.;
, It can be very helpful to tell someone else how you are feeling. Speak to your partner or roommate, or call or text a friend or family member. Choose someone who is supportive and will listen as you explain what is upsetting you.You can call a sibling and tell them “I just watched Saw IV and now I’m scared that someone is going to torture me.” They may be able to calm you down and help you realize that you’re not actually in danger.

, Remind yourself that you are just as safe as you were before watching the movie. Tell yourself that it was a movie, not reality, and realize that the movie was designed to scare you. Hundreds of people worked hard and millions of dollars were spent creating costumes, putting on makeup, and adding special effects to create a horror flick. Consider the likelihood of your fear coming true and use rational thinking to pick apart your fears.Though it may seem scary and plausible in the movie, zombies are not going to flood your neighborhood. There’s no boogeyman out to get you, either.

, The best way to overcome your fear is to face it. Expose yourself to your fear if you have access to it, or imagine exposing yourself to it if you don’t have access to what frightens you. Breathe deeply and tell yourself that you are okay, even if you are frightened.For example, if you are afraid of the dark after watching a scary movie, turn off the lights in your home. Try to sit in the dark for a few minutes before turning the lights back on and realizing that there’s nothing there to hurt you.
For instance, you may be afraid of spiders after watching a horror movie about them. Look at pictures of spiders online. Remind yourself that while they might be creepy, but they aren’t going to swell to an enormous size and try to take over your town.

, Watching a blooper reel or behind the scenes footage of the movie can reinforce the fact that it’s all fiction. Seeing the set and the characters in their regular forms may help ease your fears. Watching a scary scene dissolve because of mistakes, laughter, or other issues can help you understand that there’s nothing to be afraid of.You can also watch extras included in the film, like interviews with cast members, or short clips on how the movie was made, how the costumes were prepared, and how makeup was applied to characters to make them look scary.

,, Any craft store sells oval, egg shapes Styrofoam pieces that you can paint to make it look real.

, If you have a spider toy, you can probably use that, but you can also create one by using a small pillow and sewing on small finger-like pieces around the edges of it. Look up at picture of a face hugger for ideas.

, This will be very messy, so find an area where you don't mind getting fake blood everywhere. A chestburster looks like a long worm, that, as it's name implies, burst out of your chest. One way to get the chestburster out of your chest and looking realistic is by sitting at a table and pushing it through your shirt and having it already covered in fake blood.

, Look up some head shots of some of the cast looking normal (no crazy costumes).

, Search for an interview with one of the main characters or one of the scary guys.

, They usually aren't famous considering they wear masks and make noises the whole time. This means that they usually have small parts in other films and shows. A serial killer is never scary when the role before that was a cashier in a low-budget comedy.

, Most actors and actresses use horror films as a stepping stone into action, comedy, drama, etc. Go to IMDB.com and search for the movie you saw, once you click it, find some of the scary characters and click on their actor's names. Find some lighthearted films on their bio page and go rent them. For example, Adam from Saw and Saw III, was in the romantic comedy, The Referees.

, Do an online search for the movie's title along with ""behind the scenes"" and you'll usually get a 5 minute video going on a tour with one of the main characters.

, Some movies even go as far as having videos of the actors getting their make-up on.

, Trivia of the movie is usually interesting. For example, did you know that Starbucks refused to be mentioned in Dawn of the Dead? Use the trivia to make the horror scenes much more trivial.

, People go there to tear apart movies they saw. Most of these reviews are hilarious in nature and make the movies seem quite silly; this might be useful for feeling less taken in by the movie you watched.

, If the movie won any awards, look for the acceptance speeches of the people, it's like an interview and seeing them all happy crying is a great chance to get to know them.

, Look up goofs in the movie on IMDB, for example, in The Hills Have Eyes, ""at the beginning of the movie, after the title sequence and during a long crane shot toward the gas station, the film crew can be seen in a reflection on the green car's windows."" To find goofs for the movie, search for the movie on IMDb.com, click the search result, and then scroll down past the cast and crew, to where it says ""Goofs"". Then click, ""More"". Every movie has a ton and it will make the movie seem laughable. To make this even more effective, see the movie again and look for the mistakes. If you don't want to see the whole movie again, go to YouTube, Google video, Metacafe, etc, and search for ""goofs]"".

, Most movies have gag reels which have the cast screwing up and laughing during suspenseful scenes. For example, ""Silence of the Lambs gag reel"" brought up a video of people laughing, dancing, and ab libbing funny lines during takes. Just use Google and search for it.

, Most horror films reference funny movies, such as One Missed Call has a girl explaining the drama Beloved's plot to someone.

, Again, under Movie Connections, movies are usually referenced in comedies and made fun of. Besides, Scary Movies 1, 2, 3, and 4, Saturday Night Live has done a lot of parodies of scary movies. Look under Movie Connections> Referenced In/Spoofed In. Also, search on YouTube for fan-made parodies of the movie which are usually hilarious.

, Under Fun Stuff on the movie's IMDB.com page, click on quotes, most horror films have some seriously funny quotes. For example in One Missed Call, Beth Raymond says, ""How was it?"", Leann Cole, ""It was a funeral, it sucked. From now on I don't go to parties where someone gets cremated.""

, Now that you know what is coming up, make fun of it the whole way through. The more ridicule, the better.

, This can help you to forget the horror and replace it with really funny things. Be sure to find something that is really hilarious though; it needs to totally counteract what you just watched. This might help you to relax and sleep better.


It's probably a good idea to stay away from black comedies straight after a horror movie.

, This won't be easy but practice it anyway. Letting go of horrible images that aren't real is possible with repeated attempts, so keep at it.

Persevere.",How to Be Inspired by Nyota Uhura from Star Trek," Nyota was a very elegant woman: she had poise, grace and most importantly assurance (self-esteem). If you are suffering of lack of self-esteem, you’re not the only one. Ask yourself ""Why am I so down on myself? Have I always been like this or is it something recent?"" If you’re able to answer those questions, write them down and see how you can build your esteem back up. If it comes from something deeper, such as rape, childhood abuse, then seek help from a counselor.;
, Remember when Kirk kept on bothering her to be his communications officer for the Kobayashi Maru test? Be there for those who need you because you don’t know what demon they are battling.

, Stand your ground. Defend your beliefs, make yourself heard and give your opinion on the matter. Be tough but not rough, know when to say ‘no’ and when to say ‘yes’. Nyota always spoke her mind, ""We're outnumbered, outgunned. There's no way we survive if we attack first. You brought me here because I speak Klingon. Then let me speak Klingon.""

, Nyota always kept Kirk on his toes, ""For a moment I thought you were just a dumb hick who only had sex with farm animals.""

, Spock once said , ""Lieutenant Uhura is unmatched in xenolinguistics. We would be wise to accept her conclusion."" Vulcans do not lie nor do they give compliments, they just state the facts. She didn’t become unmatched by being lazy, she sacrificed and put in extra time/work for her feats.

, In order to exude elegance and poise, dress in a classy manner. Nyota was always in assigned uniforms, however those uniforms were ironed and kept clean.

, Due to being in the military, Nyota’s hairstyle was limited: it varied between a ponytail or a bun while on duty, and letting her hair down while off duty. Whatever hairstyle that you choose, it needs to be appropriate for your workplace. Remember that the way in which you present yourself is an expression of your personality.

, Keep a healthy lifestyle/routine: brush your teeth/floss, shower, wash your face, your hair (some people wash their hair daily, others weekly, others biweekly––just make sure your hair doesn’t stink), and put deodorant on.

, Make up should be appropriate for your workplace. Nyota’s make up wasn’t natural, but it wasn’t flashy either. She mostly focused on her eyes and added some rosy/natural lip gloss.

, Keep them clean and at normal length. Use shades that are complementary to your skin tone.

, The first thing is knowing what you want. Take a moment and imagine exactly what you want to accomplish––once you figure that out, outline it.

, When you’ve figured out your goal, write down a path on how to achieve it. See it as a road map for getting from point A to point B.

, Write down every single thing that you think you’ll need to accomplish the goal. There is no such thing as being too detailed. Overall details will help you see the bigger picture. Since Nyota’s goal was to be the best communications officer and to specifically serve on the USS Enterprise, she created a map on how to achieve it. She had to 1) apply and get accepted to university, 2) enroll into classes for communications majors, 3) study hard to get extremely good grades, 4) apply and get accepted to Starfleet Academy, 5) enroll in a class specifically for communications majors, self-defense and weaponry, 6) study even harder to get extremely good grades, 7) work out in her spare time, not only to be in shape, but also to have endurance, 8) know/understand how to use a weapon, 9) spend extra time in the library to do extra research (go above and beyond), 10) with any doubts, ask questions to the appropriate professor.

, Once you’ve written down every single detail on how to achieve you goal, put it in a schedule. Your schedule should be weekly and daily.


It’s important to have down times. The brain needs a break from all the seriousness of achieving your goal, so some distractions are necessary.

, That is the key to success for anything in life.

Write a list first of all.,
Consider whether you want an in-person or virtual relationship.,
Decide on what your preferred age range is.,
Be prepared to talk openly about Star Trek and/or science fiction.,
Free up some time and start looking.,
Search for local sci-fi clubs or meet-ups in your area.,
Patronize local comic book stores.,
Check out the traveling Star Trek conventions.,
Stop by comic book conventions.,
Hit the Trek-friendly social networking or dating sites.,
Network through friends and family members.,
Help any girl you fancy become a Star Trek fan.,
Accept her for who she is.",How to Meet Girls Who Like Star Trek," From looks, intelligence, compassion and enthusiasm for life in general to Star Trek knowledge in the specific, decide which qualities are most important before pursuing your Star Trek girl. If you don't have suitable qualities in mind, you might be dazzled by her Star Trek knowledge but not take the time to work out whether she's the right person to spend your time with for more reasons than just Star Trek. You'll definitely want to be on the lookout for a girl who shows that she is open-minded, tolerant of quirkiness and lets you be yourself, regardless of her level of Star Trek interest.


As part of drawing up your list, decide whether you want to end up being involved romantically or casually with this girl, or whether you'd like to be really good friends with a common interest of Star Trek. She might even be someone you're happy to only meet up with at particular conventions.;
, If having an online girlfriend is preferable, especially if you're mainly seeking to engage in conversation, an online Trekkie-loving lady may be ideal. There are less logistics involved in trying to find her in the flesh, although you may eventually decide to meet up at a convention or meeting. In choosing whether you want an online or face-to-face relationship, think about what would make you feel most comfortable and what lets you be yourself when first getting to know someone.


If you want a romantic relationship, a real life relationship would be more realistic than an online one, especially if you're after a long-term commitment. Then again, the love of Star Trek is not a widely shared trait, so connecting online first and then meeting later might be your only true means for meeting the absolute Star Trek girl.

, Most people have a preferred age range when dating or finding friendship but in the case of finding a connection with someone who has a specific enjoyment of Star Trek, you may need to be somewhat flexible. This is because you might find that older women have more of a love for the 1970s version of Star Trek than Voyager, which is the newer, updated and vastly different version. Be open-minded about age or the specificity of the Star Trek interests and be guided by what you want from the relationship.

, If you're afraid that you'll get glazed looks and get called a ""geek"" for mentioning Star Trek or your passion for sci-fi, then you're never going to find the girl who will connect at the same level as you. Be bold and be prepared to mention your love for Star Trek and all things associated with this genre. If she doesn't like the mention of Star Trek, then she's not the girl you're seeking––it really is as simple as that. Remember that when you connect with people, it should be a genuine connection, so that the other person likes you for who you are.


If you like to dress up and do cosplay, unless you're at a Star Trek cosplay convention, then it's probably a good idea to leave off mentioning this aspect of your interest until you're better acquainted with the Star Trek girl and you're sure of her interest level. Once she likes you for the person she's already connected with, it'll be easy for her to accept any elements of your Star Trek fan expression that might not necessarily be something that she's already doing. Be patient!

, Where you look will depend both on what you've decided in terms of the type of relationship you're after (romantic, casual, friend, etc.), how you want to connect (online or real life) and what level of interest you're hoping this Trekkie-star crossed girl will have. For example, if you want to meet a girl who gets into the comic aspect of the series or even cosplays as a Trek character, trolling comic book stores or turning up at conventions may be your best strategy. However, your strategy may differ if you simply want to meet a gal who appreciates the show, but may not be so deeply immersed in the Trekkie culture. The remaining steps

, One of the best ways to meet singles that love Star Trek is at a local sci-fi meet-up. The club or meet-up doesn't necessarily have to be focused on Star Trek alone but can be science fiction focused in general––there's bound to be some Star Trek fan girls amid the sci-fi lovers. To find a local club or meet-up, Google, “sci-fi club meet-up” and your city and state. Find out about costs, dress requirements and times, etc. and arrange to spend as much time at the meet-up or to attend as many club meetings as possible. And be ready to proudly proclaim your love of sci-fi and Star Trek!


You could also look further afield but accept that if you do connect with someone, it'll be harder to initiate a relationship if you're not there for long and then you'll have to take the time to maintain the relationship long distance.

, Star Trek comics are often a popular draw at local comic book stores. In addition to generally hanging out at the comic book store, ask about Star Trek comic book author signing parties or other events where you could possibly meet the girl of your dreams.


If you know the owner of the bookstore well, let him or her know you're trying to find female Trekkie friends. The owner might be able to suggest someone, talk to someone he or she knows to see if they'd be interested in meeting you or might even be happy to put up a notice in the store to help connect you with someone.

, Star Trek conventions continue to be as popular today as they were 30 years ago. Visit the Star Trek website in order to retrieve the latest convention information and dates. You'll meet a lot of women interested in Star Trek at these conventions but you'll need to polish up your small talk skills because it's small talk that serves as the social lubricant to bring you together with others, whether you have similar or different interests. And it's through starting a conversation that you'll discover the extent of her passion for Star Trek!


Read How to make small talk, How to conduct small talk in cyberspace and How to start a conversation when you have nothing to talk about for further details.

, In addition to ComiCon, some of the local comic book conventions are a great place to meet Star Trek girls. Ask the local comic book store owners for a list of upcoming conventions or a quick search on Google will produce a list. As with the Star Trek conventions, be prepared to mingle and talk in order to get to get to know the interests of the girls there.

, Spending time on sites such as trekpassions.com is one way to connect with other singles who love Star Trek. Additionally, Facebook offers numerous groups and fan pages devoted to the love of Star Trek. Don’t discount other dating websites such as Match.com or local dating sites, as you can often search profiles for women who are expressly interested in science fiction.

, Everyone knows someone who loves science fiction and/or Star Trek. If you aren’t the type who talks non-stop about Star Trek or haven’t voiced an interest in girls who love Spock, consider asking close friends or family members if they could recommend a girl they know as a possible date.

, If you've tried all of the above ways to find the Star Trek girl but you haven't yet made a genuine connection with someone, try the subtle method of having a girl you do fancy watch some Star Trek with you once she's either become a good friend of yours or is firmly romantically attached to you. Show her some of The Original Series (TOS) or Voyager (VOY), depending on your own preferences, and see how she reacts. She'll know these mean a lot to you so it's very likely she'll do her best to be engaged with watching them. Afterward, spend a little time explaining why you love Star Trek but don't go into copious details about its background and characters or you risk turning her off. Keep the focus on how much Star Trek means to you, to help her understand that being a part of your life means also understanding your passion for Star Trek. By all means let her know she can ask you anything at all about Star Trek and that you'll be happy to help out.

, As much as you want your girlfriend to accept your Star Trek affiliation and your need to spend time watching, reading and toying around with all things Star Trek, accept her too. If you do find the girl of your dreams, but she may not necessarily want Star Trek in her life the way you do, but she sure knows that she wants you in her life, then she's likely the one all the same. Her respect for your interest is all that you really need confirmation of. You can work out all the rest around that!

, There are three eras of Godzilla films.


The Showa Era (1954-1975) spawned the oldest Godzilla movies, the classics. Many of these seem artificial today and don't have very good special effects by current standards. Still, the original Godzilla (1954) is highly regarded: It is a masterpiece of dark tone.
The Heisei Era (1985-1995) is often cited as the best era for the franchise, the Godzilla heyday.
Films from the Millennium Era (1999-2004), as a group, get mixed reviews from fans, but this era brought to the screen, two films that rank with the original as the best: Godzilla 2000 and Godzilla: Final Wars. (Gojira Nisei: Mireniamu and Virago: Fainaru uôzu).

Earn a college degree.,
Call talent agencies and ask about opportunities.,
Apply for talent agency internships.",How to Become a Talent Agent1," As with many careers, a formal education will greatly benefit you. Many courses of study can help you become a talent agent, including English, business, marketing, film, communication, law, and public relations. You may be able to find specific talent agent courses at some institutions.These degrees do not automatically qualify you for the career, but they will give you a lot of the knowledge you need to succeed as an agent.
If you can pair any of these studies with minors such as theater, production, or acting, you’ll have a well-rounded starting place.
If you know of a specific talent agency that you want to work for, find out what college requirements they have when they hire.;
, Many talent agency jobs will not be advertised, so you may need to call and ask directly. If you know anyone in the industry, never be afraid to ask for a referral. Agencies look for people who are highly motivated, so calling shows that you take initiative.You may have to take an unpaid or part-time position to start with, but don’t let this deter you. It’s an industry where you usually start at the bottom and work your way up.
If you call once and are turned down, wait a week or two and call again. You never know when a position is going to open up and you don’t want to miss it.

, After earning a degree, an internship is the most important building block of a talent agent career. Find websites that are devoted to internships. Apply for as many as you can. Call specific talent agencies directly to ask them what internships they offer.As an intern you will most likely not work with talent or clients. You’ll more likely answer phones, file paperwork, fetch coffee, and generally do whatever your superiors ask.
Be willing to do whatever you are asked so you appear passionate. Showing that you can follow a task through to the end is what will impress the agency and afford you more opportunities.
Many talent agents start out as interns at agencies. If you show you can do the work, you may be offered a permanent position after some time.

Market yourself and your talent.,
Be persistent in your marketing.,
Be highly organized.,
Connect with people.,
Negotiate contracts that benefit all parties.",How to Become a Talent Agent2," You are essentially a salesman, and your product is the talent you manage. Salesmen do not sit and wait for people to come buy from them, so you shouldn’t either. Call casting agencies and directors and pitch your talent to them. Besides calling, you should create business cards, flyers, and postcards for your agency and your talent.


You want as many people as possible to know about you and your talent, so never think that you’ve made too many contact attempts.
Make postcards with your talent’s photo and skill set listed, as well as your name and contact info. Send these postcards out to any casting agency or company that you think might be interested in hiring your talent. Call the places you sent postcards after a week or so and check in with them.
Flyers could be placed around town promoting your agency and calling for new talent to contact you to see about a representation contract.

, You may not book a gig on your first contact attempt, so continue to pursue it and don’t give up. Don’t sit and wait for clients to call you. Contact the same people consistently at intervals of a week or two. Eventually they are likely to offer you something. The most persistent agents are the ones that succeed.You have to constantly put your name and your talent out there if you want to secure gigs. Talent agents who put a few attempts out there and then rest won’t succeed.
You will face rejection often as a talent agent, but you have to learn to shrug it off and move on to the next opportunity. Don’t let setbacks stall you.

, As a talent agent, you will have to balance many conflicting schedules from clients and talent. Make use of an online calendar and input everything into your schedule. iCal and Google Calendar are good options. Keep track of contact information like phone numbers and names, as well.Make sure your talent is available for potential gigs and make sure they get to the gig on time. Missing opportunities makes you look bad.
Start using a calendar immediately and learn to schedule your life. If you don’t always know what you’ll be doing, at least write it down after it happens so you get used to recording events.
Keep a detailed contact list or catalogue with any clients that you meet or hear about so that you have what you need to contact them as soon as you have the chance.

, Talent agents are middlemen between the talent and the clients who need to hire talent. Develop exceptional people skills and make the most of every interaction. Be friendly with potential clients and talent as well as anyone you already have a contract with. If you are easy to work with, more people will want to work with you.Go the extra mile to help someone out to show that you are a team player who wants everyone to succeed. Your success only comes from the success of your talent and your clients.

, When you are lining up a job for your talent, you are responsible for working with the client to decide on payment. The client needs to make money to pay the talent so you can also earn money. Continually work to master the art of negotiating for the best possible contract for everyone involved.Clients want to get your talent for as little possible, so you may need to push them to offer you more money. Find a balance between pushing too far and not getting enough for your talent.
You also have to work out an appropriate commission with your talent. You may decide on a standard rate or you may have a flexible rate depending on how much work each person gets.
Make sure to get a contract between you, the client, and the talent in writing for every job or gig you set up. You always want proof of the agreement that is reached.

Scout undiscovered talent.,
Choose a specialty.,
Get your talent agent license.,
Develop your talent.",How to Become a Talent Agent3," Go to local theaters, improv shows, clubs, or other venues where talent is at. Develop an eye for those who have what it takes to make it. If you see someone with potential, start a conversation with them and see if they want to work with you.You can start this practice before and during your education or training so that when you are ready to offer your services you will already know how to find people.
If you work for an agency, they will appreciate you bringing in new talent. If you work alone, you will be fully responsible for finding your talent, so you will have to get good at scouting.
You can find lots of people in big entertainment centers, but many stars are born in small towns far away from the hotspots. You can find people and gigs even in less busy places.

, Talent agents run the gamut from working with TV actors to models, and musicians to commercial actors. Working in an agency will usually mean having a variety of clients, but if you work alone you can focus in on the talent you prefer. If you can book modeling gigs easier than shows for bands, stick with that strength.You probably won’t make this choice right at the start, but you may be able to. Rather, if you do the work for a little while, determine what comes most naturally or where you are most successful and stick with that.
Remember that some talent have rules you’ll need to be familiar with. For example, child actors have restrictions on how many hours they can work in a day and week.

, You need to learn about what is necessary to legally practice your trade as a talent agent. Make sure you get the proper licensure and display it in your office and consider keeping a copy handy when you are away from the office.License requirements vary from state to state, so be aware of requirements where you practice.
As you get fully into the career, keep current on changing compliance standards and regulations.

, When you pick up new talent, you may need to groom them a little. Sign them up for acting or modeling classes to help them hone their skills. Help them learn how to nail an audition. Teach them to work well with people and sell themselves as a worthwhile investment.Your talent is a like a product you are selling, so make them as marketable as you possibly can. They may need to develop their appearance, moderate an accent they have, or find the niche of roles that are best for them.
Your job is to book jobs for your talent, but it is also to make sure your talent is qualified and prepared for those jobs. Push them to always keep improving their skills.
If you work in an agency, it may have specific protocol for grooming new talent. If you work alone, you’ll be fully responsible for figuring out the best way to help your talent improve.

Listen to the band Black Veil Brides.,
Purchase their album(s).,
Come up with your BVB warpaint.,
Believe strongly in the ideals and Recruit others for the army.,
Do have fun and treat all Ushers and Bridesmaids as family, as that is what we are.,
Start Usher and Bridesmaid gatherings, and local groups.",How to Become a Bridesmaid/Usher (BVB Army)," If you like them, and really dig their lyrics and message, move on to step two. If not, this is not the article for you.;
, Real members of the BVB army buy the music, and merchandise, so as to support the band and further the cause. But if you can't afford it, don't worry. Also, strongly consider purchasing a couple BVB shirts, and for a real hardcore fan, either a Pentagram necklace (For atheists, Satanists, and anyone who doesn't care about the meaning behind the Pentagram)(The necklace is really just the BVB symbol made into a star) Or necklace of Prayer beads/a rosary (For Christians, Catholics, or anyone uncomfortable with pentagrams)

, Most people only wear it to BVB concerts and gatherings, but some BVB fans wear it all the time, to turn heads, or just because they feel RIGHT in their paint. BVB warpaint all has it's own little twists and add ons that make each person's paint unique. Try to paint your arms and neck/face/legs/whatever in an image that reflects your inner self. The one detail that almost all warpaint has in common is a stitch on the right side of the face (with makeup of course) from the lip all the way to where your face ends and jawbones begin. This is another brilliant piece of symbolism used to express that although nobody is perfect, and everyone is wounded and scarred in some way, everyone is beautiful. This is the meaning behind their debut album's title ""We Stitch These Wounds"". Here is an example on the face of lead vocalist Andy Biersack.

, Take a strong stance against bullying and be prepared to stand up for ALL people being bullied (especially but) not just other Bridesmaids and Ushers. Though we are generally a nonviolent group, do know how to defend yourself in a physical confrontation, but do everything you can to avoid one first. Defense, not offense!!

, Whether male or female, gay or straight, white or black, rich or poor, we are all united under the stitch, and we are all equal.

, Have fun, and stay safe. Protect each other, and always remember, that we are young and we are strong. Through strength in self we become something more than they can be. This is our Sweet Blasphemy.

Take note of what genres of music you like.,
Flip through each FM station on your car radio when you are sitting still.,
Decide which stations are your favorite.,
When you start driving somewhere, pick the station you wish to hear by default at the time.,
If the station starts playing a song you dislike or a commercial break, move onto another station.",How to Best Enjoy Your Car Radio," Common genres played on FM radio stations include pop, rock, R&B, hip hop, urban contemporary, dance, alternative, oldies/classic, adult contemporary, light sounds, country and more. These genres are often ambiguous and do not necessarily have the same meaning in each market. And they may change over time.;
, Note which stations get a good reception where you live, and write down the frequency and the genre it plays. If you live near other cities, you may be able to reach other stations within an hour's drive or sometimes more.

, Set each of the six buttons on the car's radio (most car radios have 6 buttons) to those stations.


You could set one button to represent two stations close in frequency. For example, if you like 100.3 and 100.7, you could set one button to 100.3, and just two taps up brings you to 100.7. This could free up another button for another frequency.
If you like a chain of nearby frequencies, you could set one button to represent all of them. For example, you could set one button to 100.3 that also represents 100.7, 101.1, and 101.5.

, As long as that station is playing a song that you like and are up to hearing, there is no need to flip.

, Keep doing this until you find a song that you like.

Keep practicing!",How to Become More Musically Experienced," The best way to learn about music is to learn from professionals such as music teachers and band directors. You will usually be exposed to a wide range of music as well as learn the theory behind music. You can start with a school band at any age - middle school concert or marching band, high school marching band, school orchestra... there are plenty of possibilities.;
, See if you can join another group at school, or an outside ensemble. Many schools have a jazz band, an elite brass group, indoor percussion, or other things of that nature. This will expand your knowledge of different types of music.

, Many areas have All City, All County, and/or All State bands that you can audition for. Being chosen to be a part of these bands is a great honor, will challenge you, and will look great on college applications.

, S&E is an event that many school districts put on every year, where musicians can perform solos or ensemble pieces for a judge, and are graded according to their personal performance.

, This is a great way to get one-on-one help with your music, advance beyond others in your class, and get special teaching in certain areas of music that you're not as familiar with. You can also see about getting one-on-one lessons with your band director after school.

, Some schools offer music theory, music composition, or other courses of the sort.

, Learning an instrument that is closely related to the one you already know can help you broaden your skill and at the same time help you understand the differences between types of music played by different instruments. Being able to play several instruments can also make you an asset to your band, being able to switch instruments as a certain piece needs more ""power"" from a certain section.

, Pick a favorite song and analyze what makes it good, and try to apply those things to your own music. Try to play songs by ear on your instrument, or write sheet music for them.

, Get out and play your instrument or song for your church, a community event, or even just for your friends. Over time, your music will get better, and you'll get used to the stress of playing in front of people.

, This is a great way to continue on with music with your friends, and can earn you some fame and/or money in your area. If you don't wish to form a group, play as a solo musician.

, This is the best thing that you can do for your music education.

Listen to the radio.,
Save their number in your phone.,
Set the number to speed dial.,
Wait until they ask for callers.,
Redial if you get the busy signal.,
Don't call too late or too early.",How to Be Caller Number 10 to a Radio Station1," You'll need a pretty good idea of when your favorite radio stations are holding these contests. Sometimes a station will randomly welcome callers to enter these types of contests. Choose a few stations and write down the times for when they begin the contest.;
, Be careful to save the number that the DJ lists for callers to call in on. If you get the wrong number, you could easily mistake it for a busy signal., If your phone doesn't have speed dial, then store the number into your favorites. This will increase the speed at which you'll be able to dial the number.

, Calling into the station at any old time could get you nowhere. Listen for the DJ to actually say we are now accepting callers for a chance to win yada yada.If you're caller number 4, 7, or 9 in the giveaway you shouldn't give up. Even if you're caller 9 and they're looking for the 10th caller, don't give up. DJs often get distracted and don't always answer the phone calls in the order they started ringing.

, Lots of people will also be calling into the station. Chances are that you'll call-in at the same moment as someone else. Hang up as quickly as you can and redial.


Remember that the phones inside the studios don't ring out loud and they just have a little flashing light. Don't give up when no one answers in 20 rings. They may be getting to you.

, The radio station usually starts accepting calls after the contest has been solicited and the new song or commercials have started. You should wait until they say they are going to play the music or news so that you have a chance for your phone to ring.

Write or listen to shoegaze music which is ""introspective, self-deprecating music with a non-confrontational feel...",How to Be a Shoegazer,";
,,, The sound of the music was overwhelmingly loud, with long, droning riffs, waves of distortion and cascades of feedback. Vocals and melodies created a wash of sound where no instrument was distinguishable from the other -- but are usually very pretty and fundamental to the song, but its true that the magic of the songs is in the complex harmonics blended into noise."" , Guitar effects are typically from two distorted rhythms interwoven together giving an exceptional muddied sound."""

Get the right headphones.,
Don't turn your headphones up too loud.,
Keep your musical device in your pocket, especially if it is a smart phone or iPod.,
Respond when someone taps you.,
Walk fast while you listen to music.,
Know your route.,
Look at shadows on the ground.,
Look behind you every time you turn a corner to make sure no one is following you.,
Ignore people when they yell at you.",How to Be Street Smart with Headphones," Headphones of a lower quality will cause you to turn your music up loud in order to hear it well. Headphones of a higher quality will allow you to lower the volume. This will allow you to hear the important things that are going on around you in public spaces.;

, Look at them and acknowledge that they are there. If they are a stranger, say, ""Hi"" to them very kindly and avoid eye contact if having a conversation with them concerns you. If they persist in touching you, kindly tell them that you're not interested, and put your earphones into your pockets. This way they know you are fully aware that they are following you.

, It may seem silly, but it looks like you are on an evening jog rather than trying to get through an urban neighborhood without trouble.

, If you don't know where you are going, and are in a neighborhood that seems dangerous, take your headphones out to let locals know that while you may be lost, you are not too confused as to your surroundings.

, If you see one that is bigger than yours, turn your head behind to check and see if anyone is there.

, Often times, people think because you are listening to music you are completely oblivious of your surroundings. Make sure that every time you turn a corner there is no one behind you, and that people you've seen before aren't there anymore.

, A lot of individuals often find it funny to intimidate the public. When you ignore them, it makes them feel insecure, and they end up looking stupid. Just jam to your music and enjoy your day!

Learn the ""delay"" of your phone.,
Decipher which radio stations answer.If you find that one station never picks up your calls, but a different one will, on occasion, spend more time with the latter station.,
Get an extra phone.This might sound a bit far-fetched and expensive, but it doesn't have to be.,
Ask a friend to help.,

, Check the station's website and register to be a VIP, registered user, etc. Don't forget to opt in. You aren't restricted to winning on the air. More radio stations are also doing web based giveaways of the same prizes given away on the air.

Set an alarm.,
Engage after the program.,
Don't call every time you hear a contest.,
Call the radio station to chat.,
Brush up your music knowledge.",How to Be Caller Number 10 to a Radio Station3," It's a good idea to set some type of a reminder for yourself. This will also help you be less of a victim to waiting around for the radio show.

, Most DJs have Myspace.com pages, facebook.com pages or pages and emails accessible from the station's website.

Call your local opera company.,
Learn some opera vocabulary.,
Choose a good “starting” opera.,
Buy your tickets.,
Learn about the opera you will attend.,
Sleep well the night before an opera.",How to Attend Your First Opera1," Opera houses are always looking to broaden and increase their audiences. They are a good resource for those new to the art form.


They can give you advice on operas in their current season that would appeal to a new attendee.
Be sure to ask whether there are discounts for matinees or dress rehearsals.
Local opera companies may also offer tours or informational talks for those new to the opera.Some opera companies have clubs for “younger” attendees (those under 40 are often considered “young"") that offer discounts and social events.;
, Like any art form, opera has its own unique vocabulary. By learning a few of these terms, you will be more familiar with what to expect.


An “aria” is a solo song that occurs during a pause in the action and expresses a character’s current situation or emotions.The lyrics, or textual basis, of the performance are the “libretto,” which translates to “little book”.There are genres that features spoken dialogue as well as singing including the “operetta.” These are usually more comedic than traditional operas.Terms such as “baritone,” “bass,” “soprano,” and “tenor” are used to describe the types of voices of the opera singers.

, Some operas are more approachable or accessible than others. By selecting a relatively short production with some familiar music, you will likely have a better experience.Familiar, well-known titles such as La Boheme (by Puccini), Carmen (by Bizet), or La Traviata (by Verdi) are good choices for those new to the genre.Operas by Mozart, including The Marriage of Figaro or The Magic Flute, are also good choices for a first opera.An English-language opera, like Porgy and Bess (by Gershwin), may appeal to you if you’re intimidated by the foreign languages used in other productions.Decide whether you’re more interested in attending a comic opera (also known as an “opera buffer”), such as The Barber of Seville, or a serious one (an “opera seria”), like “Carmen.”

, Many popular operas sell out quickly, so it’s a good idea to purchase your tickets well in advance.


It is not necessary to splurge on the most expensive seats for your first opera.
The inexpensive seats up high in the opera house will still have good acoustics, because opera houses are designed to accommodate large audiences.You can use opera glasses, similar to binoculars, to view the performers if your seat is at a distance.
Look for discounted tickets. The Metropolitan Opera in New York City, for instance, offers a limited number of $25 tickets daily on their Web site., The more you know about the story ahead of time, the more you will appreciate the production.


Ask whether your local opera company offers information or workshops on upcoming productions.Buy a CD of excerpts or highlights from the opera that you will be seeing, and familiarize yourself with it ahead of time.
You can also download the music from iTunes or watch videos on Youtube.You can also ask the opera house to send you a program in advance of the performance or ask if they post a synopsis online. Programs guide you through the plot and familiarize you with the characters.

, You want to be fully awake to maximize your enjoyment of the production.


Because you will be experiencing something unfamiliar to you, and you will probably be reading the supertitles throughout, opera takes more mental energy to fully appreciate.
Most operas last about three hours, which is longer than you're used to watching movies.

Dress appropriately.,
Arrive early for the performance.,
Obtain a program.,
Respect general etiquette rules.,
Get ready to read.,
Enjoy intermission.,
Applaud enthusiastically.,
Check before bringing the kids.",How to Attend Your First Opera2," Many operas are approximately three hours long. You don’t want to ruin your experience by having your stomach growl throughout.

, Although an evening at the opera is a special event, you do not need to wear tuxedos or fine furs to fit in with the audience.


Unless it is opening night or a gala, many people wear cocktail dresses or suits to performances.More casual attire, such as dresses or sport jackets, are often worn to matinees. Many opera houses request that you not overdo it on cologne or perfume, so that performers and other guests are not affected by it., Your evening will be much more enjoyable if you are not rushing to enter before the curtain rises.


Be sure to have a location in mind for parking, or take public transportation if available.
Doors at most opera houses open 45 minutes to an hour before curtain time.By arriving early, you can explore grandeur of the setting, as most opera houses are extremely ornate.
You may also be able to pre-order your drinks for intermission, thus avoiding long lines.If you did not bring opera glasses, you may be able to rent them at your venue before the opera begins.Check to see whether your opera house offers tours or talks before the performance, such as at the San Francisco Opera.If you arrive after the performance has started, you will not be allowed to enter the theater until a break in the action or until after the first act., If you did not receive one prior to the performance, buy a program to give you a synopsis of the opera you are about to see.


The program will also feature the performers of the opera and give you more information about the production.

, The opera is an acoustic event , meaning that no microphones aid the performance. Thus, it is extremely important to remain as quiet as possible during the opera.


Turn off cell phones or pagers before the performance.
Refrain from opening candy or gum wrappers.
Do not talk during the performance.

, Nearly all major opera companies in the United States use supertitles, which project the line-by-line translation above the stage so you can follow along.The supertitles will help you understand the performance in real time.
Don’t worry about reading every supertitle. The emotions that drive the plot are apparent in the music., Because operas are lengthy, they feature at least one intermission per production, typically 20–25 minutes long.This is a good time to stretch your legs or use the restroom facilities.
You can also enjoy a drink or light snack at most venues.
Chimes often sound before the performance begins again to warn you that intermission is almost finished., The vocalists, musicians, and set designers put a lot of work into staging an opera production. Let them know their hard work is appreciated.


It is common to clap at the end of significant arias and at the final curtain call.Feel free to yell “Bravo!” for male performers and “Brava!” for female performers. Alternately, you can yell “Bravi!” for everyone., While it may be fun to include your children in your opera outing, it may not be wise depending on several factors.


Because of adult themes, some operas are not suitable for children. You should inquire with the opera house to see whether the production is recommended for children before buying their ticket.
Some opera companies, such as The Dallas Opera, recommend that children younger than 6 do not attend their main performances. Check about any age policies as well.

Keep up your Internet presence.,
Keep up your studies.,
Know who your real friends are.,
Prepare to work long hours.,
Keep reinventing yourself.,
Ignore the tabloids.,
Stay true to who you are.",How to Be a Popstar," One thing that almost all pop stars have in common is a wholesome factor – at least when they were first starting out. You can look at Justin Bieber, early Miley Cyrus, the members of N*SYNC, Britney on the cover of ...Baby One More Time, or pretty much any pop star, to see that they all have a level of wholesomeness, a virginal glow, and a general vibe that they won’t do anything worse than staying out past curfew. Though it gets more complicated when you see that this look also has to come with a healthy dose of sex appeal, focus on the wholesomeness at first.People want a pop star who they can relate to, not someone who is so stylish, or so much of a bad boy or bad girl, that they have nothing in common. Remind your audience that you’re not so different from the boy or girl next door.
Keep in mind that pop stars tend to appeal to an audience of teenagers or even pre-teens. You want parents to be okay with sending their kids to your concerts, don’t you?;
, To be a perfect pop star, you have to be able to add a layer of sex appeal to that layer of wholesomeness that you exude. You have to be a little bit sexy, or at least to have the potential of sexiness, if you really want to make it big. It’s tricky to find a balance between being wholesome and having sex appeal, but all you have to do is to find a way to show a little bit of skin and maturity without giving up your self-respect. Think of Britney on her first album cover – she was dressed as a schoolgirl while also bearing her midriff. Find a way to be a little bit fun and flirty without looking too adult at the same time.


Bare a little bit of skin so your fans can see your sexy side. That said, you shouldn’t have to show more skin than you’re comfortable with. You don’t have to bare it all to get people to like you.
Sex appeal is more than just baring your midriff or giving the cameras a suggestive smile. It also has to do with carrying yourself in a way that shows you’re confident and happy with how you look and what you have to offer. Stand up straight, look ahead instead of down at the floor, and don’t cross your arms over your chest or look displeased with your physical self.
Part of sex appeal is mastering the art of flirting. When you talk to people, whether they are interviewers or fellow stars, you should be a little bit playful, suggestive, and fun. Don’t completely let your guard down, but be open to being flirtatious.

, Of course, not every pop star in the history of music has been blessed with having the voice of an angel. Still, if you want to make it last, you have to start with a baseline of strong vocal chords, and to have range, too. You can take voice lessons and work on improving the talent you already have, but if you start with nothing, it’ll be hard to end up with something. Sure, some pop stars are famous for their lack of talent, their lip-syncing, or their computer-generated voices, but you want to be better than that. Think of Mariah or Whitney – no one has ever accused them of not having a voice.


This will require you to be honest with yourself and to get some feedback. Ask your friends or mentors to give you an honest assessment of your talent. Of course, if you really believe that you have what it takes, then you shouldn’t let other people get you down or tell you who you are. But if everyone is telling you that you’re missing out on the strong vocal chords, then it may be time to rethink your plan.
If you’re going through puberty or have yet to go through it, keep in mind that your voice can change. Boys who have sweet, higher voices before puberty may end up with deeper voices after it. This doesn’t mean that your voice will change for the worse, but that you should be prepared for the change.

, You don’t need to have moves like Michael Jackson to be a successful pop star. However, it does help to start with a baseline of solid rhythm, and to know how to move to a beat. If you have two left feet, though, don’t think that this disqualifies you from being the next Selena Gomez. The most important thing you need to have is a willingness to learn and the rest will follow. You should take dance classes to get your basic rhythm down, and be prepared to work with a dance instructor after you reach stardom. Another thing you’ll need is coordination – you’ll need to be able to sing and strut around on stage.


The most important thing is confidence. If your dance instructor or team see that you’re struggling, they’ll work on giving you a few simple moves that you can work with. If you can rock a few easy moves, you’ll be just fine. The important thing is that you’re willing to learn and that you’re not embarrassed about stepping out of your comfort zone to achieve greatness.

, Another important part of being a pop star is to be persistent. Just like any career in the arts, luck and determination is half the battle. Just because your first attempt at getting your work out there or getting signed by an agent doesn’t lead to much, it doesn’t mean that you should give up and find a new career path. Instead, it takes a whole lot of rejection to get to where you are, and even the most famous stars, like Madonna, had to start by waiting tables and waiting to get a big break. If you really want to follow this dream, then you have to be prepared for the rejection that comes with it.


That is to say, if you really want to be a pop star, then you need to develop some thick skin. You have to be sure about who you are and what you have to offer if you want to make it anywhere, or you’ll let other people break you before you get a big chance. If you’re really sensitive, vulnerable, and self-conscious, then you have to work on improving your self-esteem before you move forward.

, Being a pop star means being criticized in the tabloids, for everything from gaining two pounds to being accused of having an affair. You’ll have to be able to face annoying and untrue gossip and to treat it as part of the game. If you doubt yourself every time someone questions your fashion choices or questions your current relationship, then you won’t be able to make it out there. Instead, you have to learn to accept the praise, to learn from the constructive criticism, and to push aside the rest of the pointless hate if you want to succeed. You have to love who you are and to believe in yourself if you want to make it out there.


It’s not a stereotype that many pop stars get broken down in the face of fame. The endless criticism is too much for many of them to face. This means that you have to have healthy ideas about who you are and what makes you unique before you let the tabloids eat you alive.
Even the most confident pop stars doubt themselves now and again. However, starting off with little confidence will make it hard for you to stay strong. If you know you need to work on your confidence, you should do that as much as you can before you through yourself into stardom.

, Some people think that all you have to do once you make it big as a pop star is to flash a big smile, wear cute outfits, and go clubbing. However, real talent takes hard work, and if you’re committed to being a star with staying power, then you have to be able to put in the hours every single day. It’s like having a day job, only harder. You’ll often have to put in eight or more hours a day to recording songs, practicing your dance moves, rocking out at concerts, promoting yourself, maintaining a social media presence, and just making sure that you’re doing the best you can.


If you like to sleep in, slack off, or spend the majority of your time watching TV or hanging out with friends, then being a pop star may not be in the cards for you.
If you want to keep growing as a star, then you can’t settle for less than the best. You’ve got to not only make sure to perfect the moves and lyrics you’ve got, but to always work on taking it to the next level. Your audience won’t stay with you if you’re just producing the same beats again and again. They’ll want you to grow and evolve to keep things interesting. And that takes work.

, This does not mean that you have to be cookie-cutter hot and to have a perfect body to be a pop star, either. However, it does mean that your look has to stand out in some way. Think of Nicki Minaj, Lady Gaga, or Pitbull – often, it’s more important to have a distinct look that intrigues people and makes them remember you instead of being traditionally attractive. So, if you don’t think you’re classically good looking, you can find something else that makes you stand out, whether it’s a few key piercings, loud fashion, high heels, or a unique hairdo. You shouldn’t force an image that doesn’t feel comfortable for you just to stand out, but you should find something that makes you distinctive.


Pop stars are also often reinventing themselves again and again. You can find a look that makes you stand out, but then work within it to keep things interesting. Lady Gaga, for example, is always recognizable though she is constantly changing her hair, style, and general look to keep things interesting.

, If you’ve got what it takes, then the next thing you’ve got to do is to flaunt it. Being talented, cute, and determined isn’t enough if you want to make it big. If you want to get anywhere in this world, then you have to be prepared to promote yourself by networking. This may feel sleazy or not genuine to you, but that’s just the way you’ve got to play the game. Take every opportunity you can to meet with producers, other artists, dancers, song writers, or people who are connected in the industry.


Accept invitations to parties, put yourself out there, and be assertive when introducing yourself to new people without being annoying.
Swallow your pride and talk to people who maybe normally wouldn’t be your cup of tea to get your name out there and to find future opportunities, and you’ll be more likely to make a name for yourself.
It may feel unnatural to talk to people to let them know who you are, but you shouldn’t feel like you’re above it. Unfortunately, it’s rare that you can get by on talent alone, and you’ll need to do some extra work if you want to get noticed.
A big part of networking these days is having a strong social media presence. Have a Twitter account with daily tweets, create a Facebook fan page, and stay on top of your web page and Instagram account. The sad fact of the matter is, if you’re not making connections online and posting frequently, then people may forget about you.

, Applying to talent contests is a great way to put yourself out there and to get noticed. You should look out for local contests in your area, which are a great way to put your name out there and to give yourself some practice in competing with others. This can be especially helpful if you’re living in a small town and want to make it big. However, if you’re really committed, then you should move to a city like New York or LA, and try out for some bigger contests, such as America’s Got Talent, The Voice, American Idol, or whatever else is out there. The more you put yourself out there, the more likely you are to succeed.


Of course, it’s not likely that you’ll win American Idol the first time you apply to a talent contest. That’s not the point. The point is that you get used to the fact that you’ll be competing with people and putting yourself out there.

, If you want to be a pop star, then you’ve got to record your music. Wowing a director of a talent contest isn’t enough. If you write your own songs, then you should write and then record them to show producers what you’ve got. Though making a professional recording can be costly, you should try to pony up – or raise money to do so – for some time in a professional studio so that your recording is as clean and impressive as possible. You can start by recording a single or go for a whole album if you feel like you have enough material to do so. This is an important step on the path to making it big.


If you’re thinking of recording your music in a professional studio, then you should practice on your own so you’re prepared when you have to get in the studio. You don’t want to waste any time, since a trip to the studio will be expensive.

, Once you’ve got a recording of your music, it’s important to send it out to producers so you can start to make it big. If you can get yourself hooked up with an agent before doing this, then great, but if you have to do this yourself, it’s important to do it right. Ask around and do your research to send your music to producers who are looking for new talent, and who work with performers who do work that is similar to yours, but not too similar. Make sure you’ve described yourself well and that your music is packaged professionally.


Be persistent. Just because a few producers have rejected your work, it doesn’t mean you should stop sending it out. In fact, it means that you should try even harder.
That said, if multiple producers are giving you the same feedback, you should see if there’s a grain of truth in it. If you think there’s something you can do to change your sound to make it more appealing to future producers and fans, you should take that leap before sending it out more.

, If you want to achieve your dream, then you have to create a strong online presence. You can do this before you make it big, in order to show that you already have fans and that there are many people who are interested in you and your work. You can create interesting content, post at least once a day to stay current, and work on amassing hundreds, or even thousands, of followers. You can post YouTube singles, have a blog as part of your website, post photos of yourself, and just do whatever you can to make yourself known.


If a producer or agent is interested in you, it’s likely that they will Google you pretty fast. You’ll want them to see that you’re a professional who is already thinking of marketing him or herself, and that you’ve really put a lot of thought into putting yourself out there.

, Though it’s important to achieve your dream, you shouldn’t give up your studies completely to do it. It’s important to dream big but to also be realistic, and just in case things don’t work out, you don’t want to be without a backup plan. Whether you stay in school or hire a tutor or keep up your studies yourself while you try to make it big, it’s important to keep learning so that you’re still getting an education while you move forward in your career.


You don’t want to find yourself at the age of college students without getting anything resembling a high school education; this is valuable learning time that will be hard to make up.
This doesn’t mean that you’re admitting you won’t make it. It just means that you’re being smart about your future.

, If you’re lucky enough to have made it big as a pop star, then you have to make sure to keep a good head on your shoulders. You will find yourself surrounded by new friends and acquaintances who you wouldn’t have met in your everyday life. Some of them will be genuine, caring people, just like you, while others are just hangers-on who only spend time with you for personal gain. It’s important to be slow to trust people, to take your time to get to know new friends, and not to spill any big secrets when you’re just getting to know people. This will help you find people who like you for you, not for your fame.


Though it may not feel natural to keep your guard up when meeting new people, it’s important to do this to protect yourself. Ask yourself if your new friends are really interested in getting to know you, or if they just want to go to your fun parties or vacation with you.
The same goes for new significant others. Make sure you’re dating people who want to get to know who you are, not just who want to be seen in the tabloids with you, or to use you to promote their own fashion line.

, Being a pop star isn’t all about going on ritzy vacations and tweeting photos of yourself in a bikini. It takes hard work, long hours, and plenty of sweat. If you’ve made it big, then being a pop star is a 24/7 job and there is no such thing as a real vacation. You constantly not only have to work on your craft, your music, and your dance moves, but you have to work on maintaining a positive public image, and on reminding people that you do matter. If you’re really cut out for the lifestyle, then you have to put in the hours.


Even when you’re out at clubs, award shows, or parties, you still have to think of it as working because it’s important to keep up a good public image. Getting drunk or fighting in public is a bad career move, and you have to work on being on your best behavior full time, because there’s no vacation from keeping up a good image.

, Though it’s important to create an image and to remind people of how relevant you are, you can’t do the same old thing day after day, especially if you grow up a lot as you become a pop star. Sure, being an innocent girl or boy-next door is a great way to start, but if you’ve matured significantly as an artist, or have just become interested in exploring other sides of your talent, then it’s important to switch up your game.


Think of Justin Timberlake, who began as a wholesome pop star with bleached blonde curls, who is now in the throes of a fantastic R&B career. If you’re sick of singing the same old songs, then you’ve got to find a new way to be you – with a kick.
Of course, you still have to stay true to something that your fans love about you. Doing a complete career switch, like moving from country music to rap, may lead you to lose too many fans. Find a way to still be you while adding some more dynamic changes to your routine.

, If you’re really committed to being a pop star, then you have to be prepared for all of the negativity, the gossip, and the rumors. People will say the worst and most untrue things possible just to get you down and make you doubt yourself, and you have to learn to avoid what the tabloids say, whether they claim you’re pregnant or are in rehab when you’re not. Some celebrities just flat-out don’t read the tabloids, while others use their social media expertise to fight back. Whatever you chose to do, the most important thing is that you don’t let a bunch of ignorant people get you down or keep you from following your dreams.


Every single celebrity, even the most beloved of them, have had their fair share of dealing with gossip and rumors. Just think of it as an initiation process. Unfortunately, there’s not much you can do to keep people from spreading rumors about you. However, you can control your reaction to all the hate.

, The hardest part of being a pop star can be staying true to who you are. It can feel nearly impossible to be faithful to yourself when there are a million voices in your head telling you what to do and who to be. The most important thing is that you never forget your initial dream and that you don’t end up acting and looking like a complete stranger. At the end of the day, it’s all about being happy with the work that you’ve done, and in affecting your fans in a positive way. Make sure you never forget the person you were before you reached stardom, and you’ll be able to stay true to yourself.

Though making new friends and starting new relationships is an important part of being a pop star, don’t forget your old friends or family members. They’re there to keep you grounded, and they’ll keep you from forgetting where you came from.
Though it can be hard to find alone time when you’re a pop star, it’s important to make time to check in with yourself, to write in a journal, and to make sure that you’re achieving the goals you want to achieve. If you’re constantly surrounded by an entourage and are moving from one show to the next, you won’t be able to slow down and remember why you wanted to become a pop star in the first place.

Learn the basics of film-making with photography.,
Purchase suitable equipment.,
Produce amateur music videos with your friends.,
Study different genres of music video.,
Take a class.,
Shoot amateur music videos for local bands.,
Polish your editing skills.,
Enter prominent video competitions to build your reputation.,
Make a demo reel.,
Utilize social media.,
Network with local music artists.,
Submit your demo reel to music labels.,
Take a position with a production company.,
Identify moneyed companies suitable for your demo reel.",How to Be a Music Video Director," Many directors and film producers get their start in photography. Photography will introduce you to the basics of many important aspects of film making, like the different kinds of lenses, shot composition, lighting effects, and framing.


Even while learning basics with still photography, you should begin to orient yourself in the genre you are most interested. For example, if you like thrash metal, you might take pictures of or for a local thrash band to get a better feel for capturing that kind of image.
In many cases, you can get permission to take pictures of local or lesser known bands by offering free copies of your photography.;
, Filming equipment is notoriously expensive, so you'll have to take time determining which camera will be the best for your situation and budget accordingly. It's likely you'll also have to account for the cost of lenses, which can add several hundreds of dollars of expense to your purchase. Some recommended cameras include:



Canon EOS M is a very economic model that also has an HD movie mode for shooting in high definition. If cost is a significant factor for you, this may be your best option.

Canon EOS Rebel T2i is one of the best mid-cost cameras for shooting music videos. It also has a dim light mode, making it suitable for many different kinds of lighting environment. The videos you make with this will look professional, no matter the content.

Nikon D5200 is the most expensive of these three models. It has excellent features for music video shooting, like it's 24.1 megapixel CMOS sensor and 5 FPS continuous shooting, though you'll definitely need to budget for a lens for this one.
In many cases, you can buy refurbished or like new models from electronics stores, pawn shops, or online for a fraction of the retail value. However, you should be wary when you go this route. Some ""like new"" cameras have damage that isn't obvious., This will prepare you for learning how to set up and direct the action of a scene. The professional side of video production can be very demanding, and working with your friends will allow you a safe place to make mistakes and learn from them.Depending on the quality of these videos, you might want to upload them to your YouTube channel to see if you can gain some popularity and reputation.
You might consider putting together a video in the style of a flash mob, or you could involve your school/local theatre group to acting out a simple story to a popular song.

, If you want to become a truly great music video director, you should expose yourself to other great videos to learn from them. This way, you'll be able to talk about and deconstruct the differences between different styles of music video. While watching, be on the lookout for things like:The use of lighting in the video. How does it affect the atmosphere of the video? How do you think you can replicate the effect? Is there a mix of hot (strong, bright) and soft (diffused, dim) lighting effects?The composition of the video. How do the visual elements of the video work together? How are the visual elements of different scenes integrated?The framing of the video. Framing is generally considered to be the way the shot brings focus to the subject. In what ways is the subject defined in your favorite videos? How do shapes or other elements (light, shadow, environment) bring attention to the subjects in the video?, In many cases, there are photography/film classes offered at local community centers, community colleges, and universities. You can attend these to give yourself more formal knowledge about shooting and film making. You'll likely want to focus on the technical side of things, like a class on lighting effects, as an example.


If you live in a major city that has regularly produced photography/film media, you might be able to volunteer your time doing on-set tasks to get real exposure to the industry. For instance, you might volunteer to run food and drink to talent at your local news studio.
Consider going to film school for a bachelors degree in film.

, In some cases, you may even be able to convince somewhat popular though still relatively unknown bands to allow you to shoot their music videos. This will help you learn how to manage the expectations and on-camera movements of band members, and could result in suitable material for your demo reel., Not all directors are skilled at film editing, but having a general knowledge of it will help you to coach the editors you work with to your desired result. Take some time to play around with film editing software until you are comfortable with the basics. Also, you should always make sure any finished productions are well-edited.


You may want to consider taking a class on film editing, specifically. There's a great deal of psychology that goes into piecing together a story from separate shots, and knowing this can put you ahead of the curve., In particular, on-spec/brand competitions should receive priority, as these generally are more highly regarded than others. Try not to get discouraged if it takes you a while before you see any success at one of these. Competition can be fierce.Keep improving upon your method and techniques as you make videos for competitions. Critique can be difficult to hear, but can result in drastic improvements.
When you finally win or achieve a ""shortlisted"" or ""runner up"" ranking, you should include this information in any bio, personal statement, or resume you submit. These sorts of awards serve as proof that you are a serious film maker.

, Your demo reel is a short clip that shows prospective clients/employers what you can do as a music video director. It should include clips of your finest work, and shouldn't exceed more than 90 seconds in total length. It should be specific to the line of video production that you want to work in, like pop, heavy metal, or country.


These reels can either contain short snippets of many different scenes, or a few longer samples strung together.
Don't forget to include your name and contact information in your demo reel. While trying to craft the perfect demo, this can be easily overlooked.
Signify your roles during shooting with headings. For example, if you directed and also creates models for the scene in your demo reel, you might include the text ""Lead Modeler"" in one of the lower corners of the shot where it won't distract from the scene., Social media, like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube, are free ways that you can build your fanbase and increase your exposure. As your popularity among users grows, you'll notice that larger companies and labels will take you more seriously.Many bands and video production companies look favorably on a large YouTube or Twitter following due to the fact that you'll be adding your fanbase to their own.

, Local artists will also be trying to break into the industry, so they may have connections that could be useful to you on your journey to becoming a music video producer. A simple business card can help you appear more professional while providing your contact information.


Through social networking sites, you may be able to find the email addresses of PR representatives or other decision makers at music video production companies. A brief email introducing yourself or with a proposal could result in a potential gig.
Social media is sometimes a ""back door"" to companies or groups that are difficult to get in touch with. You might announce on Twitter that you're looking for a new music video project and see if anyone bites., After you have some experience and presence, you can start submitting your demo reel to professional companies and music labels. You'll want the quality of your reel to be as high as possible, as you'll be competing with other professionals for a chance at directing music videos.If your editing ability is weaker than your directing skills, you may want to hire a professional video editor to help you put together the most impressive video reel possible.

, Oftentimes, you won't be able to get your desired position right from the start, but that doesn't mean you can't work your way up to it. Running food or helping with lighting can turn into an assistant directorship or stage managing position. From those positions you'll have a better shot at directing.


When working from the bottom up, you'll often have to put in extra work to prove yourself. Be honest with your goals with other staff and your supervisors, and show them you are serious by putting forth your best effort.
You should try to angle for any position that works closely with a director, like as a director's assistant or secretary. This way, you'll have more opportunity to watch a professional in action., It takes money to produce a music video, and by targeting profitable music companies in your genre, you'll stand a better chance of getting an offer to direct. Look for companies that are actively producing music videos, as this is often a sign of financial health and stability.You can also supplement your career as a director through online means, like YouTube. Popular YouTube channels often receive compensation.

, A friend, older band member, band director, or other musical acquaintance will likely be willing to help you out.

, This includes the chromatic scale, which will likely be a requirement as well. In many auditions, points are given for octaves - three octaves, for instance, will obviously be worth more than two (however, you may only get all of the points if you do well on every octave). You need all the points you can get, so if you can play a second or third octave, do so. However, keep in mind that you will most likely have a time limit to play the scales, so don't add too many extra octaves, and it's better to play ""easy"" octaves well than to try to max yourself out and play sloppily (which means you'll lose more points than you might have gained for the extra octaves).

",How to Audition For an Honor Band3," Chances are, you'll be in a classroom or other small room that you've never been in before, with at least one emotionless person staring at you, possibly surrounded by microphones. Try to mentally prepare yourself for this beforehand, and just pretend you're in your band room or bedroom playing for your director or your parents.

, Most proctors will let you play a few notes to get a feel for the room - simply play your tuning notes, a couple arpeggios, or a short scale. This will also give you a chance to get your bearings and relax.

Any positive response might give you false hope or overconfidence, and a negative response would hurt your confidence and cause you to do even more poorly.

, Use this time wisely: Finger through it, count it, ""pie game"" it, or whatever else you have to do. Do this twice if time permits, and then take a deep breath and start playing when given the cue.

Place your stencil over your faceplate.,
Arrange all of your supplies in your work area.,
Lay out the leather belt, face up.,
Attach the velcro to the belt straps.",How to Make a Wrestling Belt," For this part of the belt, you will need to get leather, measuring tools, and leather cutting tools. Obtain a piece of scrap leather. You can get one of these at craft stores, country supply stores, or motorcycle supply shops.
A measuring tape will be needed for you to measure your belt.
You will need a large piece of cardboard to draw up a mock belt.
You will need a box cutter to cut the cardboard and a leather cutter to cut your leather.;
, Use a fabric tape measure to do this.Write down your measurements before you buy your leather.
Add approximately 6 inches to your measurement. You will need to attach velcro to attach your belt later on so you will need excess length on your leather.
When you go to purchase your leather, make sure your scrap is at least as long as your waist measurement with the adjustment for the velcro. It should be big enough so your belt can be at least 6-8 inches wide from top to bottom.

, You will use this to trace your belt onto the leather.Use your measurement from your waist plus 6 inches to mark out the length.
Use your measuring tape, a ruler, or a yardstick to make your mark.
Make sure your belt is at least 6-8 inches wide in the center.

, Center it on your cardboard belt. Rather than making a regular rectangle belt, you can fashion one that is more similar to what professional wrestlers wear.
If you choose this, your belt will have a tapered shape.
Trace around the face plate with a pencil. This will make the center part of your belt a rounded shape.
Use a ruler or measuring stick to draw straight lines to draw the sides of your belt. These should be a few inches thinner than the thickest part of the face plate part of the belt.
Your belt should now be traced onto the cardboard. Cut out its shape with a box cutter, taking care with this sharp object. This is your template to cut your leather.

, This will give you the shape of the belt to cut out.You can trace the shape of the cardboard template with a white marking pencil (available at most craft stores) or a pen. Do this on the back of the leather.
Make sure your tracing lines are smooth and dark enough to see.
Once you have traced the shape, check it to make sure there are no areas where your mark is too light or where your lines are shaky.
Remove the cardboard template and use your marks to cut the belt out of the leather using your leather cutting tool.

, For the face plate you will need to get just a few items. The faceplate is the shiny metal part on the front of a wrestling belt that is decorated based on championships and wrestling federation.
You will need to buy a round or oval brass plate from a hardware store. These are relatively inexpensive.
You will need cardboard to make your decoration stencil. You should also get a box cutter or x-acto knife to help cut out any shapes or letter on the stencil.
Get spray paint in your desired colors for your face plate.

, This is typically gold, but you can try another color based on preference. Make sure you apply the paint in a well ventilated area.
Give the faceplate a generous first coat, and then let it dry.
After the first coat dries, apply a second coat of spray paint. Let the plate dry completely.

, You will use this to apply the letters and symbols you want to your faceplate.Cut out the shape of your faceplate out of cardboard. You can use the plate to trace this if you want.
Use a box cutter or x-acto knife to cut out any letters or symbols from your template.
Once you are done cutting out any shapes or letters, make sure your cut lines are smooth without any small uneven pieces of cardboard along the edges. This will ensure your design has smooth edges when you use the stencil.

, Make sure the designs are lined up where you want them.Using a black or dark colored spray paint, spray over the stencil generously.
Make sure you are doing this in a well-ventilated area as spray paint has strong fumes.
Pick up the stencil. Your design should be left behind on the face plate.
Set the faceplate to dry in an area where it won't be disturbed.

, You will need the following: Your cut out leather belt.
Your face plate.
Small short screws and screw caps.
A drill
Industrial velcro

, You will now attach the faceplate to the leather.


Place the faceplate, face up, in the desired area on your leather belt, making sure it is centered and in in your desired position.
Using the drill, attach the faceplate to the leather using small screws all the way around the edges of the plate.
The drill will put the screws right through the leather.
Make sure you hold the faceplate down with one hand while you are screwing it into the leather to hold it in place.
When the screws are in place, put screw caps on the back of them. This is the area that will touch your skin, so you don't want sharp screw ends scraping you!

, This will be what you use to fasten the belt on when you wear it.


You should use industrial velcro from a hardware store. It has a stronger grip than the kind you can buy at a craft store.
Attach a 5-6 inch piece of velcro on each of the belt straps.
Most velcro will have an adhesive side on it that you can use to attach it to the belt. If not, you can use hot glue or sew it on.
Your belt is now assembled and ready to wear!

You're done!",How to Create a Rob Van Dam Costume,"


If you want to be REALLY authentic, simply grow your own hair out until it's long enough to be pulled back into a ponytail. Shave the sideburn area, and possibly some of the back, leaving only the ponytail, and you're done. Alternatively, you can simply get a wig and wear that. Either way, Rob's hair is brown, so take note.
If able, (and of the right gender) you can grow some facial hair to add to the authenticity. Rob is almost never clean-shaven, and generally sports a five o'clock shadow. If not, get a stipple sponge, and a black makeup.;
,


Without a doubt, this will be the single most difficult and time-consuming part of creating an RVD costume. Rob's trademark article of clothing is his wrestling singlet; unfortunately, the design changes almost weekly, so there's really no ""classic"" RVD design. Common motifs include Taijitus (commonly known as ying-yangs), Dragons, claws, and a stylized ""RVD"" either on the chest or right thigh. Alternatively, nicknames are displayed, such as ""The Whole F'n Show"" (formerly spelled out, but WWE has since censored him), ""Mr. Monday Night,"" and ""RVD 4:20."" The ECW logo is also occasionally sported.
Colors vary wildly, so feel free to experiment. If truly desired, you can attempt to copy one of Rob's actual singlet designs. They are airbrushed on, so if unfamiliar with this technique, a suggested alternative is to purchase a blank singlet of whichever base color you desire and add designs with fabric paint, marker, and/or tie-dye.
Once you've got all that, throw some black bicycling shorts on underneath before donning the singlet.

,


The hardcore will get themselves a pair of actual black wrestling boots. Everyone else will simply hit the Army surplus store and get a pair of cheap combat boots. The difference is hard to spot to the untrained eye, and since they're going to be covered anyway, it's really up to you.
After you have the boots, you need Rob's kickpads. These are a pretty specialized item, available only in places that sell pro wrestling gear, and can get pretty expensive. A cheap alternative is to get some tall black socks, cut the feet off so that you have only the tube remaining, and wear those over your boots. Get some cheap soccer shin guards, spray paint them black, and wear them over both the socks and the boots. Slap some black kneepads over the whole deal, and it will look good enough for a costume (though not for an actual wrestling match) and you will have saved yourself a lot of money. The whole effect should be black from toe to just above the knee.
Along the outer edges of your kickpads (either real or makeshift), you need to add the words ""VAN DAM"" in white, spelled vertically. You can either stencil-and-spray-paint it, freehand with fabric paint, or superglue white craft foam letters onto them.

,


These days Rob tends to sport black weightlifters tape from his wrists to about halfway down his fingers, giving the effect similar to fingerless gloves. Back in the day, he simply wore the tape around his wrists only.

,


Strut your stuff on Halloween night and remember to stay in character. Use phrases like ""Dude,"" ""Everything's cool,"" and telling people to chill out. And if anyone asks who you are, make sure to do Rob's signature thumb point while proclaiming to be ""Rob! Van! Dam!"" Hopefully any wrestling fans within earshot will chant your name alongside you at this point.

, Original gear is difficult to find, since over 50 years have passed since the invasion., Use exact searching words to find an item, or at least narrow your choices down., Ask the vendors there if they have resources to provide either vintage or reproduction gear and clothing.

, Any gaze at a doll from that time period conveys this. No outfit from the 1800's was complete without stockings.

, The can be purchased online, or you could make one by tying a pillow underneath your skirt in the back. This can be used instead of some of the underskirts.

, These can be purchased at most clothing stores. The underskirts should be thin but not too thin, and made of cotton. They help make the skirt look puffed up, and like everything else, maintain warmth.

, Wear a one-piece, ankle-length dress that is not deep. If it is sleeveless, you can choose to let it be or wear a long-sleeved top underneath it. While many colors were used, the most common colors were earth tones. Cotton garments are most common, but wool would do too.

, In the early 1800's (Regency era) you might have a high bun and curls at the temples. Later on, in the mid 1800's, there would be a low bun with or without thicker curls over the ears. In the late 1800's, you could do a french twist or french braid with bangs.

, These were worn by working class women in the earlier part of the 1800's for modesty, as well as for more practical reasons: the hair was not washed very often, and the day cap helped keep it clean. This is best used for the early 1800's or elderly women.

You're done!",How to Create a Hulk Hogan Costume,"


If you're old enough (and of the right gender), you can try growing out your own mustache. Dye it blonde if necessary (temporarily, unless you're really hardcore) and there you go.
For those unwilling or unable to grow a mustache themselves, you can try fake mustaches (easily obtainable at any costume shop), dyed cotton balls held on with spirit gum, or just some yellow eyeliner, depending on your budget and how authentic you want to look.;
, Depending on which Hogan era you're going for, you'll need a different color bandana. ""Classic"" Hulk Hogan (the one from the 80s that body-slammed Andre the Giant) typically wore a yellow bandana. ""Modern"" Hulk tends more toward red bandanas, and ""Hollywood"" Hogan from the mid-90s had a black one. If you're looking to make a Hollywood Hogan costume, look elsewhere, brother.


In either case, you need to write something on the bandana. Choices include ""Hulk Rules,"" ""Hulk STILL Rules,"" ""Hulkster,"" and ""Hulkamania."" As for getting it on the bandana, you can either hand-paint it on with fabric paint (will yield good results, but is time consuming,) Magic Marker it on (faster, but less ""professional"" looking) or simply buy an authentic Hulk Hogan bandana from the WWE store and wear that (best-looking, but expensive.) The coloring of the letters should be opposite of that of the bandana (IE yellow on red or vice versa).

, Hulk's shirt should be sleeveless, though not necessarily a wife-beater. Again, your choice of red or yellow, but make sure its color is whichever one the bandana isn't.


The shirt must also have a slogan painted on it, but make sure it's a slogan you haven't put on the bandana. Choices for the shirt include ""Hulk Rules,"" ""Whatcha gonna do, brother!?"", ""Hulk STILL Rules,"" ""American Made,"" ""Hulkamania,"" ""Runnin' Wild!,"" or simply ""Hulkster.""

, What good is a Hulk Hogan costume if you can't dramatically rip open your shirt? Note that this part is for male Hulksters only. The simplest way to make a rippable shirt is to cut a small downward slit at the neckline of the shirt, cut off the bottom seam of the shirt entirely, and simply rip when (and where) appropriate. This, while best-looking and dramatic, has two downsides: One, you just tore apart a perfectly good shirt. Two: Now you have no shirt. To get around this, buy a cheap shirt you're willing to part with, pre-cutting down the middle, and applying velcro to either side. velcro the two halves up, rip when so desired, then simply velcro it back up, that it might be re-ripped later. Repeat as necessary, brother.

, Classic Hogan wore yellow wrestling trunks, which are easy enough to obtain, and if not, a yellow speedo is pretty much indistinguishable. For those who don't want to walk around all night in what amounts to tighty whities, Modern Hogan wears spandex pants to the ring. Tye-dye is your friend here. Get some white spandex pants and tye-dye them red and yellow. Done. A less sophisticated solution is simply wearing solid red or solid yellow spandex pants. The spandex aspect is key, though; people will call you on it if you try to get away with regular pants.

, Hogan’s hair is about halfway to shoulder length, and is bleach blonde. Additionally, you can wear a bald cap for added authenticity, but if you don’t plan on removing the bandana, then don’t bother.

, Easy enough to obtain. If all else fails, get some white ones and spray paint them red.

, The somewhat hardcore will get themselves a pair of actual yellow wrestling boots. The really hardcore will then paint red flames and the Hulksters' face on the boots, but only for the Modern Hulk. Classic Hulk wears plain boots. Everyone else will simply hit the Army surplus store, get a pair of cheap combat boots, and spray paint them yellow. Don't forget the soles. In any case, Classic Hulk has white laces while Modern Hulk has red laces, so obtain accordingly.

, Classic Hulk wore white tape on his wrists. Modern Hulk wears yellow wristbands.

, Yellow-rimmed sunglasses and both red and yellow boas are optional, but only for Modern Hulk. Classic Hulk needed not such things. Also, Modern Hulk, seeing as he's pushing 60, wears a red weightlifter's belt with ""HOLLYWOOD"" painted on it in yellow, but only the truly hardcore wrestling fans will ""get"" that on Halloween night. A suggested alternative is to paint ""Hulkster"" on it, simply for added recognizability.

, the WWE sells foam-and-plastic championship belts. They're easy enough to find at toy stores, and they run about $15, so it’s not too big a budgetary strain. There's no good way to fake a championship belt. Any homemade belt is going to look it; this is the one area you can't skimp out on.

, Strut your stuff on Halloween night, prepare to be stopped for photos frequently, and remember to stay in character. Use phrases like ""Well ya know something, brother..."" ""Whatcha gonna do..."" and calling people ""Hulkamaniacs."" Advise people to train, say their prayers, and take their vitamins. Claim to be a Real American, and that you fight for the rights of every man. Strike the Hulkster's signature poses, and generally have a great time.

Stick to a budget with a non-tempered sword.,
Be historically accurate but safe with a non-functional replica.,

Decorate with fantasy swords based on fictional descriptions.Fantasy swords are modern swords that are not based on historical designs.,
Get a blade made of carbon steel if you want to occasionally use it.,
Display your decorative sword safely.",How to Choose the Right Sword1," Tempered blades have been crafted a particular way so that they can be very finely sharpened and withstand the force of combat. They are considered to be functional, battle-ready weapons.They are also extremely expensive, especially those with historical designs, with prices ranging anywhere from $500 to several thousands of dollars.Unless you are a serious collector or a purist, go with a non-tempered sword.
These are far more affordable and look just as great hanging on your wall.;
, Many collectors and enthusiasts want a sword that is historically accurate for decorative purposes. However, just because it’s ornamental doesn’t mean it can’t be used, and whenever a sword is within reach it poses a potential danger, especially if you have children in the house.


The answer to this predicament is a non-functional replica based on a historical design.These look great, but they're not usable. The blades are dull, the swords are lightweight and the designs are too flimsy to withstand any kind of force.

, Authentic swords are available to be purchased, although the price tags on them are usually rather steep. However, if you have the money, these are a fantastic collector's item. Do your research before you commit to buying a historical sword to make sure you are getting the real deal.


Many establishments or private sellers will provide certificates of authenticity.
If the sword you have your eye on doesn't come with one of these certificates, ask why.

, They are either completely original designs or they are based on descriptions pulled from literature and other works of art. These swords look great on the wall and are relatively affordable.


For example, you can easily obtain a fantasy replica of Frodo’s sword Sting from the Lord of the Rings trilogy.A huge range of other options are also available, especially online.

, Some people want a mostly-decorative sword that can be taken down from the wall and used, if the owner so chooses. These swords are called functional swords – they are battle-ready and forged like real weapons. These tend to be on the pricier side, but the quality is generally quite high.


Functional swords may come with blades that are sharpened, others may not. Be sure to find out from the manufacturer.
If a functional blade does comes unsharpened, you can easily sharpen it yourself. It is a real weapon. However, if you’re concerned about safety, leave the blades dull.

, Swords are extremely dangerous and should be handled and displayed with extreme caution. If you are doing a wall mount, consider mounting the sword high enough so that it can't be reached (especially by children).


A wall mount with a glass case enclosure is the ideal way to hang an ornamental sword.
Even if you don't have small children, speak to everyone in your home about safety around the sword.

Train safely as a beginner with a wooden sword.Actual swords are extremely sharp and not meant for training because the risk of injury is too great.,
Use a sword made of hickory for intermediate to advanced training.,
Focus on technique with a lightweight sword.The weight of an actual sword can hinder your training by restricting range of motion.,
Use a foam or padded sword for intense training with minimal armor.If you want to train in an aggressive fighting style or if you simply don’t want to wear a lot of training armor, a foam or padded sword is the perfect choice for you.,
Select a blunted steel sword for advanced training with a partner.For the experienced swordsman who engages in intense training with steel on steel contact, the blunted steel sword is the ideal choice.",How to Choose the Right Sword2," Throughout history, all sword-wielding cultures have trained and sparred with wooden swords. The two most popular kinds are the bokken (used in Eastern martial arts, and properly called a bokuto in Japan) and the waster (used in Western martial arts).


As a beginner, start off with a relatively inexpensive wooden sword made of bamboo or any other type of lightweight wood.
Choose one with a well-crafted handle and guard to ensure that the sword fits securely in your hand.

, Because of its toughness and durability, a hickory-crafted sword is the preferred training tool for the serious swords collector. Also, hickory is a heavy wood, so swords made of it are closer to the weight of an actual sword.Synthetic wooden swords made of heavy grade polypropylene are also great for serious training because of their extreme durability.
These synthetic versions are not as stiff as their wooden counterparts., Test for a lighter, more ideal weight by holding the practice sword in your dominant hand for about ten minutes. If you don’t feel any discomfort in your arm during that time period, the practice sword is light enough for your training purposes.


Move the sword around a bit and try a few practice thrusts. You should be able to manipulate the sword easily without straining any of your arm muscles.
Make sure the practice sword features a blade that is dull (to prevent injury) and somewhat flexible., These make great training tools because they allow you to engage aggressively while sparring, offering a more realistic combat experience.


Minimal armor is required, but keep in mind that foam swords can still be a little painful when used at full force.
Minimal armor in this case would be a helmet and groin protection.

, They closely approximate a real sword in almost every way, but the possibility of injury is greatly diminished.


When training with blunted steel tools, armor should always be worn.
An inexperienced user should not wield one of these, since they can be dangerous.

Choose a foil if you're an energetic, sharp-witted fencer.,
Use a rapier if you prefer a cut-and-thrust technique in combat.,
Slash and slice with the curved blade of the falchion, scimitar or sabre.,
Use the long, deadly blade of the katana for outdoor combat.,
Deliver a lethal blow with the force of a two-handed longsword.,
Exercise extreme caution when wielding a sword.",How to Choose the Right Sword3," Foil fencing requires rapid reflexes and lots of endurance. There is only one way to score in foil fencing - by touching an opponent's torso with the foil. Because the torso is such a limited portion of the body, opponents usually engage with one another in close quarters and the foil requires almost non-stop movement during combat.


In general, the foil is best wielded by an athlete who is shorter than average.
The foil offers lively, engaging combat for those who are nimble and can think very fast on their feet., Rapiers have long, narrow blades that are ideal for an offensive cut-and-thrust style of fighting. The edges of a rapier aren’t that sharp, since the emphasis is on the pointed tip rather than the blade itself. They can slash and slice to some extent, but their main purpose was for lunging and thrusting.


Details can vary from rapier to rapier, but in general these swords are thin, lightweight and intended for unarmored single-combat.
Rapiers were originally Medieval swords used by both the military and civilians., These swords originate from different time periods and cultures, but all of them feature a curved blade with a single sharpened edge meant for violent combat. They were sharp enough to slice off the limbs and head of an opponent in a single stroke.These blades could be used for combat in close quarters and also worked well if you were on horseback.
Even when wielded by an unskilled swordsperson, these swords could cut through most armor and inflict massive damage and deadly wounds., The katana was one of the sacred swords of the Samurai. It features a long, extremely strong blade that is best used in combat on an open battlefield rather than close in close quarters. It was equally effective when fighting on the ground as it was on horseback.


The blade of the katana is slightly curved, single edged and usually at least 24 inches in length.
Katana are some of the most revered swords ever to have been forged, made of very durable, high quality steel.They were and still are considered works of art.

, These Medieval swords featured long grips that allowed the swordsman to wield it with both hands. The blade was usually double-edged and quite long, but the sword itself wasn’t overly heavy, so it was a very versatile weapon that could be maneuvered quickly and easily.


The longsword could slice, slash, cut and thrust with lethal force.Wielding a sword with both hands on the hilt allowed the swordsperson to deliver very powerful blows.

, All martial arts can be dangerous, but the sword is particularly hazardous because of the sharpness of the blade. Train with good instructors and always handle your sword with the utmost attentiveness. One mistake could result in severe injury and even death.


Always keep your sword stowed somewhere safe when not in use.
Small children should never have access to your sword in the house.

Decide who you want to portray.,
Consider class and profession.,
Dress for an activity.,
Favor simple fabrics.,
Accessorize appropriately.,
Try making your costume.,
Buy your costume pre-made.",How to Dress for the Renaissance Fair1," Choose a character or a type of person to dress as at a Renaissance faire, or just what type of look you’d like to borrow ideas from. Use this as your foundation for putting together an outfit.


Some common “characters” to dress as are peasants, pirates, wenches, and royal nobility.
It may help to sketch out a design on paper, or save images of pieces that you like and want to find, make, or otherwise emulate.
Note that while many people choose to dress according to the era, which is typically set in Elizabethan England at most faires, Renaissance faires have also become a gathering place for a wide variety of subcultures and cosplay (costume play) of all kinds, whether or not it relates to the time period.;
, Decide whether you’d like to dress as someone of lower or higher class, typically either a peasant or noble. Also consider if the type of person you portray has a specific job or trade.


For example, you might wear a dirty leather apron as a blacksmith, a flour-dusted apron and hat as a baker, and a typical “wench” outfit as the owner of a tavern or inn.You may also dress as a higher class person, or even royalty, who would not have worked in difficult trade or labor and would thus wear more high quality and expensive fabrics and outfits.

, Consider what you might be doing at the Renaissance faire, or what the character you portray might do as a leisure activity, sport, or performance. Take practicality in consideration with authenticity.


For example, you might be riding a horse, dancing, or working at a trade, all of which might warrant slightly different attire.
Keep in mind the weather on the day of the Renaissance faire as well. They are often held in summer, so you may not want to wear quite as many layers as might have been typical for some period outfits.

, Remember that if you are going for authenticity, you should look for fabrics that would have been available in the 14th-17th century, or at least closely resemble such. Consider both color and fabric type when purchasing your garments.


Look for earth tones like green, brown, beige, and rust. Choose pure white only when dressing as an upper class person, and purple only for the highest royalty. Avoid neon colors, patterns, and other bright modern shades.
Choose fabrics made with natural fibers or materials, as synthetic fabrics were not yet invented in this time period. Go for cotton, raw silk, linen, woven cotton, wool, and leather. Use velvets, satins, and brocades only for high class and royalty costumes., Add to your clothing with accessories made from leather or other natural materials that might have been seen during the Renaissance. Remember to keep it simple and period-specific if you can.


Try a simple leather belt and attach one or more pouches, also made of leather or a natural fiber, as a nice accessory as well as a way to hide away 21st century things like cell phones, wallets, and car keys!Don a tricorn hat for a classic pirate-type look, or a bonnet-like “muffin” hat for a female peasant costume.
Choose sturdy leather boots, if possible, or other practical footwear made of natural material.
Note that many Renaissance faire venues won’t allow real weapons inside unless you’re a performer, so opt for a costume sword or another decorative-only weapon for your accessories., Make your Renaissance faire costume yourself if you have the skill and the right tools and materials available. Seek assistance from another tailor or costume designer if you need assistance on unusual garments.


Check fabric and craft stores near you for sewing patterns for garments of the time period, like bodices, skirts, breeches, and doublets.
Look online for more sewing patterns, inspiration on the type of pieces you’d like to make yourself, or even suggestions on how to alter existing clothing to make it more period-accurate.

, Check out costume retailers or specialty stores for items meant to portray the Renaissance time period. You may only need to buy a few pieces to form a simple but authentic outfit.


Try thrift or secondhand stores, garage sales, or vintage shops for used costume or specialty items.
Check websites like Ebay and other locations that may be easier to search for specific items.
You can also buy clothing directly from sellers at a Renaissance faire, and either change your clothes there or save it for the next faire you attend.

Grab the corner of the bed sheet in one hand.,
Drape the sheet snug across your chest.,
Shorten the toga if necessary.,
Wrap the toga around your back.,
Tie the toga.,
Secure the layers tightly.,
Head to the party to show off that nice toga!

",How to Make a Toga out of a Bedsheet1," Leave about 6-8"" (15 - 20 cm) of the sheet in one hand to tie the knot with. Hold the bed sheet above either shoulder with the corresponding hand (left hand to left shoulder, right hand to right shoulder, etc.).;
, Then tuck it under the opposite arm.








, If the toga is too long, fold one edge over by about six inches (15 cm), and try again. Keep adjusting until you get the right length, which is around the knee area.

, Tuck the sheet under the arm you're holding it with, then once more around the front of your chest, under the opposite arm, and across your back.

, Bring the second corner of the sheet up over your back to the corner in your hand. Secure the two ends with a brooch, pin, or simple knot.








, Use a couple of safety pins inside the toga if necessary.

Consider undergarments.,
Choose a corset or bodice.,
Don a skirt or dress.,
Keep jewelry and accessories simple.,
Wear sensible flat shoes.",How to Dress for the Renaissance Fair2," Look for a chemise, the long shift worn as the base layer for female Renaissance clothing. You can forgo or supplement modern underwear with this garment.


A half size chemise is like a loose blouse, while a full size is like a long, loose nightgown. Substitute a long shirt or nightgown in a light, neutral color if you can’t acquire an authentic chemise.Forgo a modern bra if you plan to wear a traditional corset or structured bodice, as these will provide support for your chest and be more accurate to the time period if you’re going for full authenticity.

, Cinch a corset or a pull on a structured bodice over your chemise to achieve the narrow hourglass shape that was popular in all classes for women of the Renaissance period. Find modern and more vintage styles available widely in stores.


You can wear a corset or bodice as the main outer garment for your upper body, or you can use one as support and structure for a top and skirt or dress that you pull over it.
Make sure any very fitted garment like a corset is not worn to the level of discomfort or for a very long period of time.

, Wear a skirt or dress that reaches the floor or your ankles for a typical Renaissance look. Wear a gown or dress over your chemise and corset, or a separate skirt to complement your corset or bodice.


Avoid any ruffles, adornments, or patterns on skirts. For more volume, add crinoline or other layers underneath your main skirt.
Wear two or more skirts layered over one another and tuck the the top layer up into the waistband at the sides for a typical peasant look and shape.The costume for a woman of nobility would include a more formal and elaborate gown, made of velvet or silk and including a very full hoop skirt or “farthingale” underneath., Don a hat and belt and opt for jewelry with natural metal or stones. Remember that you want to keep the jewelry authentic if you aim for a period costume.


Go for light or no makeup, unless you are achieving a nobility look, in which case pale powder and dramatic rouge are acceptable.
Nobility can wear a girdle adorned with chains, jewels, and a purse that matches the gown. A fold-out fan is also a high class accessory.
Pull your hair up into a snood (a traditional hair net to hold back the hair), a simple clip, or a bonnet or other hat to keep you cool for a summer Renaissance faire., Keep footwear plain and simple, in a material like leather if possible. Try flats or boots worn under your dress or skirt.


Note that flat, practical shoes have the added real-world benefit of being more comfortable when walking around Renaissance faire grounds.
Don’t worry too much about the authenticity or quality of shoes compared with the rest of the outfit, as they will mostly be hidden under long skirts anyway.

"

Don simple breeches.,
Wear a loose-fitting shirt.,
Top with a jerkin or doublet.,
Use accessories wisely.",How to Dress for the Renaissance Fair3," Wear pants in earth tone shades that have a lot of volume and fall at the knee, or just above or below. These are often referred to as breeches or knickers.


Avoid pants with pockets, zippers, or other closures or embellishments. Stick to only drawstrings at the waist and hem for closure.
Cover the rest of the leg that is showing below your breeches with hose or wool socks, unless you are portraying an Irish or Scottish Renaissance man, for which bare legs were acceptable., Choose a loose, simple shirt for your upper body, sometimes called a poet shirt, with long sleeves and a low or drawstring neckline. Find this type of shirt in most vintage or costume stores.


Remember to favor simple colors and fabrics. Renaissance men’s shirts were typically cotton and off-white or beige in color.
Opt for a shirt with no collar, a drawstring collar, a drop collar, or a high collar for an authentic look.For a noble gentleman, the shirt may have lace details, or be made of silk.

, Put on a loose fitting sleeveless vest (jerkin) or a form-fitting vest with detachable sleeves (doublet). Consider this as a nice practical addition when weather is cooler.


A simple jerkin can look more simple and suitable for peasantry, or more formal and suited to nobility, depending on the style and quality of fabric.
For an outfit for nobility, find a doublet in velvet or corduroy, and match the color of it to your breeches., Don a hat, belt, and boots, and use other accessorizing minimally and according to trade. When in doubt, keep accessories minimal.


Stick to sensible, durable shoes, preferably in leather. A peasant or tradesman might wear leather boots, while nobility might have short laced and polished shoes.
Find sheaths or other holders for weapons to attach to your belt. Get costume weapons to comply with any safety standards the faire might have in place.
No hat or a leather cap is acceptable for a peasant male. A floppy hat made of velvet or a hunter’s cap is appropriate for nobility."

Enjoy your toga!",How to Make a Toga out of a Bedsheet3," It is recommended to use a twin sheet, though a full sheet can work (especially if you are taller). Fold the sheet lengthwise until it is the desired length of the final dress. For a short toga, fold the sheet in half. For a longer toga, fold down only the top 6” to 1’.

, This should be done such that one half covers the back of your body and the other half covers the front. The folded down section should be at the top and outside of the rest of the material.








, Use a single pin for each shoulder or a number of pins. Pin the front section of sheet to the back section of sheet where your clavicle meets with your shoulder. You can buy fancy pins for the occasion or you can use 2” or similar round button (like political buttons).








, A hole should have been formed by the pinning on the side where the front of the sheet meets the back. Place your arm through this hole.








, Use string, a ribbon, or a tight fitting belt to tie the waist. You will probably need to overlap the open sides a bit before you secure the waist, to ensure that your skin is not exposed.








, Have fun telling people that this is a historically accurate Greek dress...if you’re into that kind of thing.

Start early with piano.,
Rock out on a guitar.,
Consider picking up a classical instrument.,
Shake hands with a brass instrument.,
Don't forget about the woodwinds.,
Get rhythm by taking up percussion.,
Consider new music instruments.,
Check out this list.",How to Choose an Instrument1," Piano is a common starter instrument because it's easy to really see the music. Common in many cultures and styles of music, piano or keyboard is an excellent choice if you want to learn an instrument, regardless of whether you're young or old. Piano variations you'll be able to add to your repertoire later might include:


Organ
Accordion
Synthesizer
Harpsichord
Harmonium;
, From classical to death metal, learning the play guitar opens all kinds of doors into new musics and styles. It's had an impact on pop culture more than probably any other instrument, and is a super-popular choice for first-timers everywhere. Pick up an acoustic guitar to stay mobile, or check out its electric cousin to get started bumming out your neighbors and playing heady licks. Once you've got guitar basics mastered, you could also add other instruments to your six-string canon:


Bass guitar
Mandolin
Banjo
Harp
Dulcimer

, One of the most viable careers in music performance revolves around playing classical strings, in orchestral, string-quartet, or other settings. The instruments of the chamber might be right for you if you've got an interest in classical sounds. While they may have a stuffy reputation, these are still commonly used in folk musics and other settings all around the world. The classical strings include:



Violin. This is generally seen as the ""lead"" instrument in the world of strings. It's got an excellent range, is easy to hold, and is sublimely expressive in a way that few other instruments can even try to be.

Viola. Somewhat larger than a violin, it's deeper and darker in tone than the violin. If you have longer arms, and larger hands, you might consider the viola rather than the violin.

Cello. The cello is much larger than the violin and viola, and must be played sitting down, with the instrument between your knees. It has a rich, deep tone akin to a male human voice, and while it can't reach the heights of a violin, it is immensely lyrical.

Double Bass. This is the lowest-sounding member of the violin family. In classical or chamber surroundings, it's most often played with a bow, and occasionally plucked for effect. In jazz or bluegrass (where you will often find a double bass), it's generally plucked and occasionally bowed for effect.

, Both simple and complex, the brass family of instruments are basically long metal tubes that feature valves and buttons that alter the pitch. To play them, you buzz your lips inside a metal mouthpiece to create the sound. They're used in all types of concert bands and orchestras, jazz combos, marching bands, and as accompaniment to old-school R & B and soul music. Brass instruments include:


Trumpet
Trombone
Tuba
French horn
Baritone
Sousaphone

, Like brass instruments, woodwinds are played by blowing into them. Unlike brass instruments, woodwinds are played through reeds that vibrate as you blow over them. They make a variety of beautiful tones and are extremely versatile instruments to play jazz or classical music with. Woodwind instruments include:



Flute, piccolo, or fife

Saxophone
Clarinet
Oboe
Bassoon
Harmonica

, Keeping the time of most music groups is the job of the percussionists. In some bands, this will be provided on a kit drum, while other combos will feature a wider variety of instruments, banged on with mallets or hands or sticks. Percussion instruments include:


The drum set

Vibraphone, Marimba, and xylophone

Glockenspiel

Bells and Cymbals


Congas and bongos

Timpani

, People are making music with more things than ever before. You may have seen that guy on the street corner, with 5 gallon (18.9 L) paint buckets and saucepan lids, tearing up the rhythm. Drums? Maybe. Percussion, certainly. Consider playing:


iPad. If you have one, you probably know by now there are some truly amazing musical instruments that defy categorization. Tap on the screen and a voice emerges from a puddle of blue on a green background. Flip apps, and now you're playing a vintage '80s synth that cost $50,000 then, and $.99 now—and sounds better.
Have you got a couple turntables? To be a great DJ takes a lot of skill and a lot of practice, and anybody who tells you that's not music is wrong.

, As you can see, there are more instruments than you can shake a rhythm stick at. Some of the difficult-to-categorize are listed below:


Erhu (Chinese two-stringed fiddle)
Guqin (Chinese stringed instrument)
Sitar
Dulcimer
Koto (Japanese harp)
Bag-pipes
Ukulele
English horn
Pan flute/panpipes
Bagpipes

Mark your mask for painting.,
Paint your mask.,
Allow the paint to dry fully.,
Glue on your extras.,
Paint and adorn your dowel to match your mask.,
Adhere the handle to the backside of the mask.,
Allow the glue to dry fully.",How to Make a Masquerade Mask1," The standard mask goes a bit above the eyebrows and ends at the top of the cheekbone, but yours doesn't have to.


A basic masquerade mask is an elongated horizontal oval with a curved hump for the nose. More elaborate masquerade masks can cover more of the cheeks and forehead with exaggerated points at either end. Look for ideas on the Internet or a costume shop. You will also need to decide the type of materials to use in your mask construction.;
, For a sturdier mask, use cardstock. You could also take several pieces of paper to make it even stronger.


You want the outline to be plain with plenty of inner white space. Use letter-sized paper -- anything smaller wouldn't work and anything bigger would be a waste.

, Doing this now will help you see if you like the shape of your mask -- you can adjust it as necessary or add a detail as part of the shape of your mask.


Attaching flames or swoops onto the outline can make it more interesting and even change its shape entirely. Consider flames, swoops, hearts, stars, and geometric shapes.

, Be careful! Use a good pair of scissors to prevent any snags or tears. Leave a little extra room on the sides if you are attaching a band or some type of holding device.


Trim your eyeholes much larger than the size of your actual eyes. Having more visual space is safer, more comfortable, and it tends to look better.

, You'll be very glad you do this -- you won't end up painting your mask and having it turn out poorly or not to your liking. Make your marks light; you don't want to see them through your paint.


Creating a design for the surface of the mask might include multiple colors and textures. Sketching those outlines ahead of time will allow you to maintain symmetry.

, Take care as you hold it; if your fingers touch the wet paint you could smear it (or get it on your clothes). Paint on several coats to get a rich hue.


The choice of color is a personal one, but traditional colors include deep reds and metallics. Use a small paintbrush to ensure clean lines.

, Be patient -- this could take a while. Set it on a covered surface in an open area and leave it be.


Depending on the type of paint you used, this could take up to 4 hours.

, This is totally up to you, but do consider weight, bulk, and tackiness. Too many embellishments will leave your mask looking overdone.


Masquerade masks are traditionally loud and flashy, so adding materials such as rhinestones, glitter and colorful feathers is normal. Stick with your originally planned theme and don't overcrowd the surface.

, If you don't have a dowel, you can use chopsticks, a firm straw, or a very carefully rolled up piece of card.


Feathers are the traditionally adornment to a dowel, but you can use strings of pearls, leaves, or any embellishment you see fit.

, The easiest way to do this will be with a hot glue gun, though other methods will work, too.


The position of the handle is unimportant. Some masquerade masks have handles coming from the middle, others have it from either side, and some masks have no handle at all.

, Hold the dowel in position for 30 seconds to make sure it's secure and in place. If it moves at all, apply more glue.


Wave around your mask a bit -- if it seems sturdy, you're done!

Slap your thigh.,
Strike your thigh again.,
Move up to your heart.,
Strike your thigh twice.,
Slap your heart again.,
Move back down to the thigh for another slap.,
Give your thigh a final slap as you conclude the song.,
Sing along.When you get the rhythm of the hambone down, you can also sing along to the beat.,
Speed up and slow down.",How to Hambone1," The opening note of the hambone song is made by striking the outer thigh or “hambone” with your open hand. In terms of musical notation, this note should be a quarter note.A quarter note lasts for one quarter of the duration a whole note lasts. In terms of the hambone song, you can think of the quarter note as one beat. Strike your leg and hold steady for a mental count of ""one,"" representing one beat.
For the purpose of learning the basic hambone song, you should use your dominant hand to strike the thigh on the same side of the body. For instance, if you are right-handed, you should use the palm and open fingers of your right hand to strike the outside of your right thigh.
As you get more proficient with the rhythm and song, you can switch things up by striking your left thigh with your right hand or by slapping both thighs with both hands simultaneously. Either move can liven up the performance and enhance the overall sound.;
, For the next note of the song, strike the same outer thigh with the same open hand. The movement will essentially be the same as your first slap, but instead of lasting as a quarter note, this note will only be held as an eighth note.


An eighth note is half of a quarter note. With this song, a quarter note can be counted as a single beat, so an eighth note will only last for half of a beat. Strike your leg and put your hand in position for the slap that follows before you can finish counting off to “two” in your head.
Use the same thigh and same hand when practicing this song for the first time. As you grow more accustomed to the movements, you can switch hands and thighs during the middle of the performance.

, Slap an open hand to your chest, just above your heart. This slap should be performed as another eighth note.


This slap and the one prior to it should be completed by the time you reach a mental count of “two,” with “one,” having been completed on the quarter note of the first slap.
Use the same hand and keep the palm and fingers open.
As you grow more comfortable with the hambone, you can change things a bit by bringing your hand up halfway and slapping the palm of your other hand, rather than your chest.

, Bring your hand back down to your thigh. Strike the outside of your thigh with the back of your open hand for one eighth note and the front of your hand for a second eighth note.


By the time you complete both thigh slaps, you should be able to complete another beat, or the mental count of “three.”
Stick with the same hand and same thigh while learning the basics. Switch things up with other hands and thighs as you get more comfortable.

, Bring the same open hand up to your chest, just above your heart, and give the area another hearty slap. This note will be another eighth note.


This note should be the first half of your final beat.
As before, you can slap your opposite hand if this feels more comfortable than slapping your chest.

, The final strike is another eighth note. Bring the same hand back down and slap the outside of the same thigh with the back of your hand.


This slap will complete your final beat. By the time you complete this one and the heart slap before it, you should be able to count off another beat, or the number “four” in your head.

, Continue on in the above pattern for as often long as you desire to make the song longer. When done, conclude by flipping your hand back over and striking the outer thigh with the open palm and fingers of your same dominant hand.

, There are several sets of lyrics floating around the Internet and you can easily select one of those options. You could also come up with your own rhyme that matches the beat of the song.


One set of lyrics goes: Hambone, hambone / where you been? / Round the world and I’m goin' again. / What you gonna do when you come back? / Take a little walk by the railroad track. / Hambone.
In a second set of lyrics, the words go: Hambone, hambone / Have you heard? / Papa’s gonna buy me a mockingbird. / And if that mockingbird don’t sing / Papa’s gonna buy me a diamond ring. / And if that diamond ring don’t shine / Papa’s gonna take it to the five and dime. / Hambone.
In a third set, the lyrics go: Hambone, hambone / Where you been? / Round the world and I’m going again. / I just skinned an alley cat / To make my wife a Sunday hat. / Took the hide right off a goat / To make my wife a Sunday coat. / Hambone.
In yet another set, the lyrics can be sung as: Hambone, hambone / Trying to eat / Ketchup on his elbow, pickle on his feet / Bread in the basket / Chicken in the stew / Supper on the fire for me and you. / Hambone.

, As you get more and more comfortable with the rhythm of the song, you can show off by speeding up your slaps and going at a faster pace. Maintain the same pattern and the same set of quarter and eighth notes, but work faster or slower as it appeals to you.

Get very young kids started with whatever musical instruments you have on hand.,
Buy toy instruments for slightly older children.,
Consider hiring a private tutor once your child is old enough to learn a real instrument.,
Encourage your child to join the band or orchestra program in school once they are the required age.,
Stay involved with their practice as they continue to grow.",How to Encourage Your Child to Play a Musical Instrument," If you have an instrument, like a piano for example, very young children can always at least get their start just having fun. Otherwise, try constructing homemade musical instruments for very young children. You can introduce young children to playing music by crafting instruments with them from simple household objects. For instance, you can make a drum from an empty coffee can. Maracas can be made by gluing 2 paper plates to each other with some uncooked rice in between. A simple tambourine can be made by gluing small jingles to a sturdy plastic plate.;
, As children get older, you can introduce them to miniature-sized versions of real instruments. Toy xylophones and keyboards are perennial favorites in the toy section of large retailers. These instruments can encourage children to begin making music using different pitches. Help them to appreciate instruments like these by teaching them very simple songs like ""Mary Had a Little Lamb.""

, Because many school programs do not offer band or orchestra classes until 5th or 6th grade, you will need to pay for private lessons to get started with music earlier than that. Learning an instrument that can later be used in school, such as a woodwind or brass instrument, will save you money and allow for continued study with the same instrument. However, many children may be more inclined to practice an instrument such as guitar or drums.

, This is the most important step you can take in getting your child to play a musical instrument. Being able to practice and perform music along with their schoolmates will make the experience more fun. They will also be exposed to numerous opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that are attractive on college applications.

, Encourage your child to stay involved in school music programs through high school and college, if possible. Communicate well with your child's band director and / or private tutor to stay informed of how their skill is progressing.

Experiment with lots of different instruments before committing.,
Look into your possibilities.,
Keep your options open.,
Consider your size.",How to Choose an Instrument2," Get your hands on a trumpet, guitar, or trombone, and make a few notes. It won't be music yet, but it'll give you some idea of whether or not the instrument is fun to play, and worth spending some time with.


Typically, if you want to sign up for band or orchestra at your school, call-outs are regularly held during which the directors allow you to experiment with instruments and select one. Go to one of these call-outs and check out all the different kinds of instruments.
Most instrument stores are excited to share their instruments with you and let you give them a shot. They might even be able to show you a few things.

, If you're starting out in a school band, check and see what instruments the band includes. Most concert bands in schools have clarinets, flutes, saxophones, tubas, baritones, trombones, trumpets, and percussion as starter instruments, and let you advance to other instruments like oboe, bassoon, and horn later on.


You can begin making your decision from the instruments that are available. You can also ask the director which instruments they are short of—he or she will be very grateful if you can fill an empty spot.

, You may want to play the baritone sax, but the band already has three players. You may have to first start on the clarinet, then move to alto sax, and finally switch to bari when a slot opens up.

, If you're starting out in middle school, and smaller than the average student, a tuba or trombone may not be the right instrument for you. You could try trumpet or cornet instead.


If you're younger or still losing teeth, you may find it hard to play some brass instruments because your teeth aren't very strong yet.
If you have small hands or fingers, the bassoon may not be for you, although there are bassoons made for beginners with some keys for small hands.
Think of how braces will affect your tone, especially for most brass. Find out whether you'll need them, or when any current braces will come off.

Play what you like.,
Play what will be practical for your situation.,
Just pick one.",How to Choose an Instrument3," When you listen to the radio, Spotify, or your friend's mix tape, what do you hear that instinctively perks you up?


Do you find yourself thrumming along to the bassline, or do you go into wild air-guitar frenzies? Perhaps you should look into stringed instruments.
Do you thrash the air-drums and beat your fingers on the table constantly? These are all great clues about what your ""natural instrument"" might be, and it involves hitting things with sticks, hands, or both!

, You may have a natural affinity for drums, but your parents have said, ""No way—it's much too loud!"" when you told them. Be creative—either suggest digital drums which you can only hear through headphones, or re-think your needs, and start with something softer and not as jarring, like a set of conga drums. Play drums in the school band, but practice at home with a rubber practice pad.

, While you can be very analytical about what to play, there's another thing to try that has a lot of benefits. Close your eyes (after reading this), and write down the first 5 instruments that come to your mind. Now, look at what you wrote.


One of those picks is your instrument. The first one came straight off the top: it might be what you really want to play, or it might be just what you associate learning music with.
With each successive pick, you focused more on what you wanted. By the fifth choice, you may have been digging for an answer. It's a safe bet that all would be instruments you would enjoy, but which is the best choice? It all depends on who you are, and how you're going to learn.

Print out your template.,
Tape a piece of plastic wrap over the template.,
Tape tulle over the plastic wrap.,
Trace the template with fabric paint.,
Cut out the mask.,
Attach ribbon to the edges.",How to Make a Masquerade Mask2," With this method, you can print out a template that has a great amount of detail. It will take longer, but you'll be able to include as much detail as you'd like.


Place it on the table. Clear a space much wider than the paper on your surface.

, Make sure it's covered on all sides and the template can't move around underneath.


If you seem to be having issues, tape the edges of the template down to the table, too.

, It should be much bigger on all sides than your template. It does not have to be perfectly centered; it just has to be bigger.


If you don't have tulle, you can use sheer fabric. Know that tulle is stiffer and easier to work with it.

, For your first mask, you may want to stick to one color. Be careful not to rest the edge on your hand on the template, smearing the paint.


If you do use more than one color, be aware that the colors may run a bit together where they meet.
Let it dry overnight.

, Gently peel the tulle off the table, making sure everything is dry first. Carefully cut out the edges of the mask and the eyeholes.

, Cut two pieces of ribbon 20″ each. Spread a little fabric glue on the tips and attach them to the mask. Let dry 1-2 hours.


You can trim the strands shorter if you like, just make sure it will tie around your head before cutting!

Put petroleum jelly over the to-be-masked area on your face.,
Start forming your mask.,
Take off the mask.,
Add shape to the mask.,
Attach a dowel.,
Break out the sandpaper.,
Start painting.,
Add your embellishments.",How to Make a Masquerade Mask3," Be generous -- if you miss an area, it may hurt when you're taking it off.


This method will not pull out your eyebrows. Just be liberal with your application of the petroleum jelly; you'll be thankful you did.

, Cut and wet your strips of plaster and make an 'X' on your face. Place the first two strips diagonally across the bridge of your nose.


Apply strips until you have attained the shape of the mask you want. Take extra care around your eyes -- leave a little more room than you need.






Smooth out all the pieces as you put them on. You'll want a smooth base to design later on.

, You'll have to wait for it to dry first, though. When it starts to become itchy, that's when you know it's ready.


Loosen up the mask by scrunching your face over and over. The movement of your face and the jelly will slowly ease the mask off the form of your face.

, This step is completely optional -- if you're happy with the shape of your mask now, move onto decorating. But if you'd like to add a bit more, go on ahead!


If you'd like to add ears or any other shape, cut it out from a piece of card and glue on. Attach more plaster on and around it until it's smooth and allow it to dry.

, The most accessible way to do this is with a disposable chopstick. Glue it on and place plaster strips over the tip. Smooth over.


Any stick-like object will do. When you're finished attaching the dowel, allow it to dry overnight.

, Start grinding away to smooth the rough areas. It doesn't have to be perfect, but this will remove the grainy, granular look of the plaster.


Wipe the dust off with a cloth and spray with a coat of clear paint to seal. Let it dry.

, Here's where you get to do just about whatever you want. It may be wise to stick to one color. Most masquerade masks employ only one color scheme.


Once you're done painting, you may want to include a top coat of glitter spray. It adds a nice, finishing touch.

, They'll cover the tip of your dowel and make your mask look professional and stylish.


Think about bows, feathers, ribbon, and jewels. And definitely think about combinations!

Clap your hands once.,
Hit one knee with one hand.,
Hit the other knee with your other hand.,
Speed up and slow down.",How to Hambone2," A hambone “gallop” is a simple three note combination: hand, knee, knee.For the first beat of this gallop pattern, clap both of your hands together.


Clap your hands so that one hand rests on top of the other.
This works best if you are sitting with your knees or thighs extended directly below your hands.

, Slide your top hand off the bottom hand and strike the top part of the thigh lying directly below it.


The beat or rhythm of this slap should be the same in duration as your first slap.
Keep your hand open so that the inside of your palm and fingers strike your thigh.

, Flip your other hand over and strike the top part of the corresponding thigh with the inside of your palm and fingers.


The beat or rhythm of this slap should be the same in duration as your first and second slaps.

, Repeat these three slaps in successive order to create the gallop effect. The more rapidly you perform the effect, the more impressive it sounds and the closer it comes to an actual gallop. You can experiment with the speed until you find one that sounds pleasing to you, though.

"
"
Experiment with your own rhythms and patterns.,
Hambone with both hands.,
Hambone using your cheeks.,
Strike your elbows and calves.,
Slap different areas of your body at the same time.,
Stomp your feet and clap your hands.",How to Hambone3," There's no rule saying that you must follow one of the patterns described in this article. Experiment with your own moves, rhythms, and patterns until you find a way to express yourself using this technique.


While there might be a traditional rhythm for the hambone “song,” hambone itself is a musical technique or practice and not a song. Hambone is simply a form of percussion that uses the human body as an instrument. It has its roots in African-American tradition.

, As you get more comfortable with hambone motions, creating a more impressive sound and show by striking your body with both hands simultaneously.


When slapping your hambones or thighs, you can use both hands to slap both legs or use them to strike one leg.
If you feel like being even more showy, you can swap legs and strike the right thigh with your left hand and the left thigh with your right hand.

, Another common hambone technique you can incorporate into your own set of rhythms is the cheek slap, made by slapping your cheeks with the fingertips of both hands.


Open your mouth all the way before narrowing your lips into a narrow, rounded opening.
Pat your cheeks rapidly using only your fingertips. If you use your palms or fingers, the sound will come out flat instead of rounded.
Change the sound as you slap by opening and closing your lips. Opening your lips wider creates a higher pitch and narrowing the opening creates a lower pitch.

, If you are flexible enough, you can twist your arms and legs as you hambone so that you can strike your elbows and lower calves with your open hands.


Get creative and experiment with different slaps on different areas of the body.

, You can deepen and enhance the sound by striking multiple places of your body simultaneously with two different hands.


For instance, you could slap your chest with your right hand while striking your thigh with your left hand, or slap your thigh with a backhanded right hand while striking the calf of your leg with your left hand.

, The hand clap is a very basic move, but it does create a percussion sound using your body as an instrument, so it still qualifies as a hambone move. The same can be said for stomping your feet.


Stomping your feet can be an especially good move to work in since you can stomp or tap your foot while slapping the actual notes out using your hands. This can help you maintain the right rhythm.

Figure out how much you want to spend.,
Figure out the key components for a heavy metal guitar.,
Choose a guitar style.,
Examine the materials and construction of the guitar.,
Recognize the brands and equipment that are good for your genre.",How to Choose a Guitar for Heavy Metal1," New and improved manufacturing techniques have introduced a wider range of guitars at the lower end of the market. There are many options to choose from even if you have a tight budget. For instance, one can get a decent guitar for $300.If you have a bit more to spend (e.g., $500 – $1000), there are a wide range of moderate to higher priced guitars.If you are a new player, you may want to purchase a lower end model. You can learn to play on lower end models and eventually work your way up to pricier models once you know the basics.
Be honest with yourself. Simply buying expensive or signature models won't make you a great guitarist. You need to practice.
If you already own a guitar or two, consider spending a couple hundred dollars more this time around. If you spend a little bit more, you will ensure you are improving your overall collection of guitars.;
, First, you will need an electric guitar. This is a guitar that needs to be plugged into an electric amplifier for any sound to be heard. They are often completely solid and very heavy. You can also buy hollow ones but they are not as good for heavy metal.In addition, you will need an electric guitar with the right pickups, strings, and wood tones.Choose an electric guitar with humbucker or active pickups. Humbucker pickups give the guitar a thick and beefy tone, which is great for the genre. Active pickups allow you to have more control of the sound.Figure out the scale length you need. If you prioritize playability or are a newer player, go for the 24.75 inch scale. If you want a tighter response, go for the 25.5 inch scale.Examine the electronics on the electric guitar. There are many options available such as phase switching, coil tapping and kill switches.Decide on the bridge you want. The main choice is between fixed versus tremolo-equipped bridges. Tremolo bridges have springs to adjust spring tension, which allows you to raise and lower the pitch of all the strings at once. A fixed bridge is better for beginners., You will need to think about stylistic choices when choosing the right guitar. For instance, you should ask yourself the following questions: Do I want a six string or an eight string instrument? What colors do I want?


Decide on the colours and profile you want. Edgier profiles are more associated with the genre.Decide whether you want a six string guitar or a seven or eight string instrument. Seven and eight strings are becoming popular amongst more experienced players. They allow for a greater range of notes.Don't use hollow body guitars for extreme genres. It is better to buy solid body guitars because they sound better for heavy metal.

, You should examine the wood used in the construction of the guitar body, as well as the shape and wood used for the guitar neck.Choose a mahogany or basswood guitar. Mahogany is a great wood for heavy metal because it has deep and resonant tones. Basswood also sounds great and is less expensive.Pay attention to the wood used in production of the neck. Rosewood, Maple, and Ebony are some woods that won't easily get clogged with dirt.
Look at the neck of the guitar. Thinner necks can be a good choice if you are a new player., Some of the brands that are respected for this genre include Ibanez, Gibson, Schechter, Charvel and Dean.Read guitar reviews in heavy metal magazines. By familiarizing yourself with the heavy metal scene, you will become familiar with the leading brands of heavy metal guitars.
It is not recommended to buy a Fender with single coil pickups for heavy metal, although it is otherwise one of the best guitar models.
Consider brands that are typically less expensive like Yamaha, Cort, Aria, Fernandez, Squier, or LTD. Don't forget the goal is to learn to play the guitar, rather than boasting.
If you are a first time buyer, avoid purchasing expensive models with crazy shapes.

First, buy a cheap prom dress, the bigger the better.,
Next, you need to add things to the dress.,
If you need to make sleeves: Find a pattern online for bell sleeves.,
Sew on decorations to the dress.,
Now your dress is ready.,
Makeup should involve a pale face, pink cheeks, and red lips.,
Now, make sure you wear comfortable shoes - you can even wear sneakers, since your dress will be long enough to cover them.

",How to Create a Marie Antoinette Costume," You can find them for under $20 at the Goodwill or at thrift shops. If you don't think your dress is puffy enough (i.e. it can fit through the door), buy a bridal crinoline while you're at the thrift shop. I bought one for about $10. You can also search eBay or other online shops for dresses and crinolines.;
, Head to Walmart and into the craft section. There you can buy bows, ribbons, lace, beads, pearls, rhinestones, and the like in coordinating colors to your dress. If your dress has no sleeves, you will also want to buy fabric for sleeves.

, Sew the sleeves and leave the end that will be on your shoulder and armpit with a raw edge. Sew that to the dress in a way that you find attractive. Then, put the dress on. Right above the elbow, bunch the sleeve up so that it is skinny on the top and poofs out on the bottom. Sew it in place. You can sew a ribbon around the bunched part too.

, If you need inspiration, look for Marie Antoinette photo gallery on Google. Bows and lace were frequently used to adorn dresses, as well as pearls and diamonds.

, However, you still have a ways to go - after all, what was Marie Antoinette famous for? Her hair! You could buy a wig, but if you plan on doing your hair yourself, you should begin practicing early. In order to achieve Marie Antoinette hair, you need a filler - I used a ball of yarn. You place the filler on your head, pin it in place, and pin your hair over it to cover it. When you're done achieving tall hair, decorate it similarly to the way you decorated the dress. Rosettes, pearls, roses, etc.

, Fairly simple, really, you will just need an average makeup kit for that, so nothing to worry about.

Know what kind of tone you want.,
Number of windings of copper wire is CRUCIAL to the sound as well.,
Once you know what you want, go out and set your sights on a few sets.",How to Choose Single Coil Pickups," THE most important thing you need to know: what kind of tone are you looking for, or what are you lacking in your current setup? Make sure it's not the amp, or anything else that you're not liking. If you have cheap ceramic pickups, chances are you need to replace them if you want a better sound.


What kind of tone are you after? If you want a single coil with more punch to drive your amp harder (if it is a tube amp), you can try single-coil sized humbuckers, made by big companies such as DiMarzio or Seymour Duncan, among others. Or maybe you'd like a cleaner-sounding pickup, that has a vintage output? Many companies offer various styles; some well known ones are Fender Custom Shop '69s, '54s, and so on. Check many manufacturers.
AlNiCo pickups have a balanced, and bright sound, with emphasis on highs and not so much mids. Ceramic pickups are usually hotter and have more mid-range.;
, More turns means that the magnetic field is enhanced, and will produce more mid-range. An example is the Fender Texas Special. Fewer turns means the sound will be brighter and cleaner.


You may find something like D.C. resistance, which is a general way of getting where you want to be. More turns of wire=higher D.C. resistance=less treble. If you want vintage-sounding, 5 K-ohms through 7 K-ohms is where you'd like to be. For fatter and stronger sounds, anything higher will do.

, Be prepared to spend close to $200 for a set, maybe more, if you want Fralins or Duncans. However, some small companies can do it for a lot less. Try to play guitars with your desired style of pickup, and try to approximate your set-up as well.

Decide where to go guitar shopping.,
Go guitar shopping with a friend.,
Prepare yourself to talk to the salesperson.,
Shop around for a second hand guitar.,
Consider the appearance and construction of the guitar.,
Feel out the playability and intonation of the guitar.,
Go for lunch and talk the purchase over with a friend or partner.",How to Choose a Guitar for Heavy Metal2," Mom and pop stores offer better service. They will get your guitar set up and give regular maintenance. Online stores sometimes offer better prices but will not give you as much service or help.You can also look for second hand guitars by talking to friends who play music or looking online. If you buy a second hand guitar, you will want to do more testing to make sure it is in good condition.

, If you have a friend who knows more about guitars than you, bring them along when you go guitar shopping. They not only know about guitars but they know you as well. They can help you make a good decision.If you have a guitar teacher, consider asking them for advice. They know how you play and the music you like, so they can also be a great source of advice when shopping for a guitar., The guitar salesperson will ask you questions about your price range, style, and playing ability. You should be able to tell them how much you want to spend, your preference for heavy metal and your experience with the genre. This will help them help you make the right decision.Listen carefully to the salesperson and ask lots of questions about models, prices, and key characteristics of the various models.
Avoid making a spur of the moment decision. If you decide on a guitar while talking to the salesperson in a guitar shop, it is probably best to write down your decision on a notepad and think about it for a day. This may help you avoid getting talked into buying the wrong guitar.
Ask the guitar store if they will allow you to test the guitar for a couple days before deciding.

, If you shop for a second hand guitar, you should look for a reliable individual (e.g., friend or relative with a guitar) or source (e.g., a guitar shop that carries secondhand guitars). You should pay special attention to the quality of the construction such as whether there are any loose components or cracks in the guitar.


Ask an experienced player to go second hand guitar shopping with you. An experienced player will know what warning signs to look for in a second hand guitar, such as cracks in the neck or loose components.If such warning signs are present, you should look elsewhere. Otherwise, you should simply look for the guitar that is right for you in terms of appearance, construction, and playability.

, You want to consider not only the look of the guitar but also how well constructed it is. You want to get a guitar that is both good looking and durable.Reflect on the appearance of the guitars in the store. Do you like the way the guitar looks? Do you like the shape of the guitar? Do you like the colour? Of course, aesthetics does not determine how well the guitar sounds but you want a guitar that you like.Look at the construction of the guitar. Check that the metal hardware is tightly screwed in and there is nothing rattling. Strum the open strings and listen for rattling. Run your hands along the neck of the guitar to see if the frets are smooth and correctly filed. If you are not sure how to do it, ask an experienced guitarist to check the frets for you., You want to choose a guitar that will stay in tune and play well. If your guitar is always falling out of tune, you may be less likely to play it. If it doesn’t feel right when you are playing, it might be harder to learn how to play.


Consider the playability of the guitars in the store. Can you press the strings down to the fretboard pretty easily? Are the frets up the neck really hard to press down? They are typically a little harder to play but it shouldn’t require excessive stress.Try playing an expensive guitar. Then switch back to playing an inexpensive model. Which feels more playable?
Check the intonation of the guitars in the store. You should check to see if your guitar plays in tune. Play a 12th fret harmonic on the first string and match that to the fretted note at the 12th fret. The notes are different in tone but the pitch should be the same. If you have a hard time with this test, ask an experienced guitar player to do the test for you.

, Follow your natural shopping instinct. Is the guitar right for your ability and ambition? Talk it over with people who know you and your ability.

Choose the right guitar pick.,
Replace the strings on your guitar.,
Find the right pickup for your guitar.",How to Choose a Guitar for Heavy Metal3," The pick is an important tool, since it connects your body to the guitar. You want to choose the right pick for your style.If you do a lot of tremolo picking, you want something with a medium pointy tip and a large thumb hold. Great for black metal tunes.If you do more precise picking, you want something a little bit stiffer so you can define individual notes. This is great for death metal songs.If you like fast shredding solos, choose something that is very stiff and pointy. This is great for power metal and thrash songs.If you play doom or stoner metal, choose a lighter pick that allows you to get the most out of every note.If you play punk rock, make yourself a homemade pick by punching out an old credit card., You should pick strings that are designed for heavy metal. You will want guitar strings with a thicker gauge. Don’t purchase strings with a gauge below .010-.052. These will be too thin. On the other hand, you don’t want a gauge that is too thick because it will put a strain on your guitar neck and potentially alter the intonation.Change your strings after purchasing your guitar. The strings on it will be testing strings. You can use different gauges for different sounds and tones.
You know you need to replace your strings if they sound dull. You also know they need to be replaced if they sound out of tune or look dirty. If you don’t remember when you last changed them, you should definitely replace them.You should replace all of your strings at once., Most importantly, choose one that fits your guitar. Figure out the characteristics you want, since some pickups are designed more for hum cancelling and others are simply very aggressive. The humbucker style is often favored by heavy metal guitarists."

Choose a Neapolitan mandolin for classical music.,
Buy an F-style mandolin if you prefer country or bluegrass music.,
Buy an A-style mandolin for a less costly option.,
Choose an electric mandolin if you're in a band.,
Set a budget.,
Buy a mandolin with spruce soundboards for the best tone.,
Buy a laminate or plywood constructed mandolin to save money.",How to Buy Your First Mandolin1," Classical as well in its construction with a rounded, gourd-like back, this mandolin is closest to the original mandolina if you're interested in an authentic piece. If you prefer a darker toned instrument, and are willing to pay more for a finer construction, as cheaper ones are rumored to have a poorer sound, consider purchasing a Neapolitan style mandolin.;
, The F-style is a fancier looking instrument and typically has a scrolled top and ornately carved body. Most professional bluegrass and country musicians prefer the F-style mandolin. However, when you are buying your first mandolin, realize that the F-style will cost much more than the A-style., A-style may be a good choice for beginners if you enjoy bluegrass, Irish music, old-time tunes, classical or rock and roll. A-style mandolins have carved tops, a flat back and a single or twin sound hole., Having the ability to amplify the sound of the mandolin, which can be muted by other stringed instruments in a band, makes choosing an electric mandolin appealing. Hooking your mandolin up to an amp and adapter can help the sound of the mandolin to resonate against the other instruments also. , With a price range of $200-$8000, there are many factors that add and subtract from the final cost of the instrument. Be prepared to consider the type of wood, whether it is solid construction or pieced together, and who is making it.

In the $200-$300 range, instruments will be in the A-style with a laminate style wood construction. These instruments are likely imported from Japan. They are still reported to sound fine despite their lesser construction, and could be a good choice for a beginner.The $500-$1000 range includes instruments of higher quality wood which are more ornately decorated. Parts of the instrument may be of a solid construction rather than pressed together. They are still of the A-style as you'll need to add approximately an additional $1200 to begin in the F-style.
The $2000-$3500 range includes even greater detailed instruments in finer wood qualities. You will finally be able to see some F-style instruments of good quality in this price range as they are a little fancier with the scroll at the top of the instrument and hand carved., Those who make mandolins are very careful about which piece of spruce they choose, testing each one for certain sounds before construction. Quality hardwoods do increase the price of the instrument., They still produce a decent sound, and you won't be spending the big bucks. You can tell if a piece is solid wood or laminated by checking out the seams to see if you can detect a layered effect.

If the piece is laminated, you will be able to see a thin layer of spruce over an under layer of mahogany or possibly even plywood."
"
Check out numerous mandolins in person.,
Go to an acoustic shop.,
Be careful purchasing online.,
Consider buying a used mandolin.,
Look for a solid physical construction.,
Have an experienced player check out the instrument as well.,
Play the instrument before you purchase it.,
Test the action of the strings.",How to Buy Your First Mandolin2," You'll want to hear how a variety of instruments in various price ranges sound and even how they feel upon closer inspection. Not all instrument stores will specialize in mandolins, or even carry them, so you should do a little shopping around., Acoustic music shops or mandolin dealers should have sales personnel experienced with these types of stringed instruments. If you are able to find one who has been in business and/or played for a long time, they will be a valuable resource in choosing the best beginner instrument. Ask around and get a variety of opinions on instruments and retailers., If you purchase a mandolin online, be sure that the retailer provides a fully refundable return policy, so that you can ship the mandolin back if you decide you don't like it. Purchasing an instrument without having been able to hold it in your hands and hear how it sounds can be a gamble for a first time buyer., While it may not be as impressive as having one built for you, being able to talk to a person who has owned the instrument for some time and probably has a fair amount of knowledge about mandolins in general, could be really beneficial for you as a first time buyer., Make sure that the joints, seams and bindings are solid and hold the instrument together. Check for cracks and missing or broken parts if you plan to purchase a mandolin that is used. Inspect the neck. The neck should be straight and the joint that holds it to the body should not be loose.

Examine the face, or soundboard, of the mandolin. When you are buying your first mandolin, you don't want to purchase an instrument that has a warped soundboard. When in doubt, consult a mandolin luthier (stringed instrument maker or repair person)., Ask for their opinion on whether the mandolin has the correct arch to it when they look at it from the side. Then, ask them to look at the back of the instrument and check to make sure it does not have any fine cracks. This can be a sign of wear in an older instrument or mishandling of a new one that could warrant the help of a luthier to fix it.Turn all the tuning keys to make sure they function. A beginner mandolin should be easy to tune., Take along a friend or mandolin teacher with you for a second opinion. An easily playable mandolin is sometimes said to be the most important quality for a beginner, even over the sound of the instrument. If it's too difficult to play, you may not stick with it.Strum each string, pressing down on every fret, listening for buzzes and tone quality. You don't want a beginner mandolin that buzzes or won't stay in tune.

, The action is the distance between the fret board and the strings. The action on a beginner mandolin should not be too high, and it should not hurt your fingers when you press down on the strings."

Get a strap.,
Purchase some strings and extra picks.,
Consider buying a capo.,
Purchase a songbook or a CD/DVD with some song instructions.",How to Buy Your First Mandolin3," You can purchase a hard case or a soft case, referred to as a ""gig bag."" Hard cases tend to be more expensive, but also offer greater protection. A good rule of thumb is to consider how much you have spent on the instrument and use that to decide on how expensive of a case to get for it. Either way, you will want to protect the instrument from scratches and nicks., Electronic tuners are recommended, and getting familiar with the tuning process is too. You will inevitably have to replace strings on a stringed instrument and tuning will be necessary to ensure the best sound and the longest life of the instrument. , This allows for ease in carrying and playing the instrument with less strain on your body. It also allows for less chance of dropping and damaging the instrument while playing or carrying while not in its case., There are wide varieties of both of these necessary tools and a lot depends on your own personal preference, so as a beginner consult others opinions and try some out for yourself.

When buying strings, the different makes can affect the sound. Roundwound makes the instrument a little more bluegrass in style whereas flatwound has a more classical tone to it., This tool is strapped to the fretboard of a stringed instrument to allow a different range of sound than would be possible without it. They come in either metal or nylon and a range of costs., You will need music to play after all is said and done, and while you may be able to find it online, it's nice to have something readily available to start with. Bring a book or two home with you."

Craft a budget.,
Decide whether to purchase used or new.,
Determine which model to buy.,
Shop around.",How to Buy and Sell Musical Instruments1," Decide beforehand how much money you are willing to invest in your instrument. If you are a beginning player, perhaps plan to spend a bit less. If you are a professional player, you likely will want a high quality instrument. In that case, your purchase is an investment in your career and future.


If your child is in a first year music class, you might consider spending less money on her first instrument and then if she sticks with it, buy her an upgrade later.
For children starting to play, renting an instrument is also an affordable option. Even pianos are available to rent. Check your local music stores or ask your child’s music teacher for more information.;
, Based on your budget, think about the pros and cons of buying a previously used or brand new instrument. For example, a new instrument should be in excellent condition, not be tarnished or scratched, and function well. It also will cost more than the same model that is used. Used instruments might have slight cosmetic defects but could function just as well.


Some used instruments, such as valuable, historic violins are actually considerably more expensive than new violins.
If you are a period player (e.g. play mainly Baroque music), you might seek an instrument from that period. This likely will be more expensive but can be worth it if you play at an intermediate or professional level.
If the instrument in which you are interested is vintage, you likely will pay a higher price.
For beginner players, used instruments are a great idea. Children particularly will feel less pressure if their parents have not invested a significant amount of money in an instrument for them.

, When looking to buy an instrument, there are numerous manufacturers, models, styles, and materials. Based on your budget, available space, and living situation, seek the best option for you. When deliberating, the following considerations might help:


If you live in a small apartment, you might prefer to buy an electric keyboard that you can place on a table.
If you plan to place your piano in the living room, see how much available floor space you have. If you have a very large room, you could potentially purchase a baby grand or grand piano. For smaller rooms, an upright piano might suit you well.
For pianos, you can purchase regular upright pianos with the option of listening to the sound via headphones. These pianos are ideal for dense living situations.
When purchasing a drum set, consider whether you have space and sound protection for a full set. If you live in an apartment building and have lots of neighbors, you might buy an electric drum kit instead.
Silver trumpets are more valuable than brass trumpets. Similarly, flutes with gold mouthpieces also have a higher value. If you want to resell your instrument in the future, consider the values of the materials.

, In order to get the best product and price, look at all the available options. Check for online retailers that specialize in your instrument. Also, visit local music stores and consignment shops. If your area has a service like eBay or Craigslist, inquire into listings there as well. Your local flea market also might have some instruments on offer.


If possible, always try out an instrument prior to purchase.
If buying a more expensive used instrument at a pawn shop, flea market, or through an online site, ask for a certificate of authenticity.
Do not send any money for an instrument through an insecure format (like international money transfers).
Ask your child’s music teacher for a recommendation.
Inspect instruments before purchase if possible. For brass instruments, check the valves. For pianos, lift up the lid and check the strings. Check for any noticeable defects.

, Maybe the actors have done something that your relatives have done too.

, What things do you have in common? Have you gone through some of the same things as them or been in their position? Catch the reactions of the other actors on what the actor who resembled you had done. Perhaps, you could learn something to make yourself a better person.

, See if you can spot product placement advertising or other brand names featured in the movie. Often most of them can be tad obvious to the audience; trigger your laughing bag if you find it awkward!

, See how long you can hold your breath. Use your watch to time yourself or just count in your mind. Again, if you violate the serenity of the theatre, people may find you brain sick.

, You might want to use your hands to do the counting because the dull movie may cause you to lose count if you reckon the number mentally.

, Start mentally changing what the actors are saying; for example pretend they end all their sentences with the words, ""for booze."" You can even stop paying attention to their real words and make up a whole new, more interesting conversation for them to have. It sounds immature, but can be incredibly hilarious in the right movie. Just try not to laugh too loud.

, Try to make yourself laugh (quietly)!

, See if you can determine where specific sounds are coming from inside the theater. Move your eyes and tilt your head slightly towards the direction of the sound. People around you who thought that the movie was uninteresting may laugh to that!

, Also known as a cue mark, it appears very briefly in the upper right hand corner of the screen about every 20 minutes. It's a cue mark that tells the projectionist when to change a reel., Recite the alphabet backwards or count backward from 200 by sevens. Other similar mental exercises will help you pass the time.

, This is especially fun if you choose incongruous names, for example: if you see a character who looks like your high school math teacher, name him Montel (which means ""chubby"" in Malay language). Try not to laugh out loud.

, Did someone just fall out of a plane and live? Come on, filmmakers. Again, try not to laugh out loud., Doing some ""good deeds"" may help you avoid having to watch another boring movie in the future.

",How to Build a Simple Cigar Box Guitar,"


A right handed guitar has the neck oriented to the left. The tuning pegs will be on the left and the tail of the guitar will be on the right. A left handed guitar will be the opposite. Measure and mark accordingly!
Take the box and remove the lid by cutting it along the paper seam in the back. This will help you cut the box and position the neck without having the lid in the way. Looking at the box front on, find the center of the left and right sides and mark it on the painters tape. mark 3/4"" from the center. This is where you will cut the box down for the neck. Mark on the outside of the left and right side 1"" down. Cut these areas out of both ends of the box. The holes on each end should be 1 1/2"" x 1"".;
, The scale is the distance between the nut (tuning peg or head) end of the strings and the bridge. There are no rules as to length but 24"" is a good start so we will use that.


Put neck stock in the box with about 1 1/2"" sticking out the side and measure 3/4 the way into the box from where the tail end meets the box. This is where the bridge will be. Mark on the neck stock in pencil where the neck meets the outside of the box on each end. Do not worry that your neck seems deeper as the hole it sits in. It should be about 1/4"" deeper. Adjust as needed.

, Remove the neck stock and measure from the bridge mark out 24"" along the neck. This point is where the nut will be. Remember the nut is where the strings end at the head end.

, At the head end of the neck, you are going to make a series of cuts that will thin out the head so that you can apply the tuning pegs. You will need thin the head down to 5/8"" from its 3/4"" thickness. From the point where you have the mark for nuts, measure about 5 1/2"" out on the neck and cut there. Measure 5/8"" from the bottom of the neck in the head area and mark this the length of the head area on both sides.


You will need to remove the 1/8"" to 3/16"" from the top of the neck. Hold or clamp the neck in a vertical position and saw down the neck along the mark in the head area. Saw until you reach about 1/2"" from where the nut will be. Cut this area out from the top. Don't worry if you didn't get it straight or if the cut was even. Using hand tools is difficult and you can always make a new neck later.

, You will need to make a series of holes in the head area for the tuning pegs. Take two pegs that are for one side and one for the opposite side and arrange them on the neck so that they are not too close together (about 1/4"" apart). Something like left-right-left or right-left-right. Mark where the holes should be and drill 3/8"" holes in the head. Make sure the shaft of the tuning pegs are 3/8"". If not, use the appropriate drill bit.

, Lay the neck in the box where you marked the outsides on the neck. Measure from the box edge to where the bridge mark is. Put the lid on and lay a piece of painters tape where the bridge should be using the same distance you just measured. Mark this point. This is where the eyebolt/bridge will be.

,
Remove the neck and on the tail end in the are that sticks out, drill three 1/8"" holes roughly 3/8"" apart. They can be closer or farther, but make sure the center one is centered to the neck. You can drill in any spot or shape you want (see example picture).

, Place the neck back in the box and replace the lid. You can glue the lid shut if you want. Use rubber bands or painters tape to hold the lid shut. You can screw the lid onto the neck if you want or you can glue it as well.

, Place the 1/4""x2"" poplar strip on top of the neck so that it sits flush with the lid and mark it where the head was cut. Make sure it covers where the nut was marked. The nut will sit on top of the fingerboard.


Once cut, glue it onto the neck by spreading the glue thinly on both the neck and the fingerboard using an old credit card or cardboard. Place them together, wipe off the excess glue and clamp using rubber bands. Allow to dry.

, Once all the glue is dry, remove the tape from the lid and the rubber bands from the neck. Attach the guitar tuners using the screws provided. Glue the nut in place using a small amount of glue as well as the bridge. Use painters tape to hold them until dry.

, Once all the parts are dry, remove the tape and cut two holes in the lid for the sound holes (see picture). The holes can be about 1"" to 1 1/2"". Try to center them as best as possible. Try using painters tape to mark where you want the center of the holes to be.

Schedule a snack intermission.",How to Enjoy a Movie at Home," Maybe you want to enjoy your movie in solitude, or maybe you want to round up some pals or family members to watch with you. It’s your call.

Watching a movie with others can be a blast, but it also means that you might need to compromise on a movie selection.;
, If you are watching alone, simply pick the genre that you’re in the mood to watch. If you’re stressed, a comedy could help you relax. If you want some excitement, go for a horror flick. On the other hand, deciding on a genre as a group can be tricky, particularly for diverse groups. When in doubt, pick a popular genre, like adventure or comedy. You might want to avoid more polarizing genres like documentaries or musicals., Browse movies within your own collection, or take a look at the options on streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and DirectTV, if you have them.For each movie you consider, check out online reviews to get a better idea of movie content and quality.
Set a time limit for movie browsing. This can take forever if you’re not careful, and then you’ll have less time to enjoy the movie. Give yourself 20 minutes, max., If are watching a movie with kids, be certain to check movie ratings as you browse to help you find age-appropriate content. While ratings can guide your selection, they aren’t meant to provide all the answers. You should do research on your own as well.Reading a couple of different online sources can help you determine whether a movie is age-appropriate.

, If you are enjoying your movie alone, simply pick the movie that you feel like watching within your chosen genre. Otherwise, consult the people who are watching with you.

If you can’t come to a consensus, try taking a vote.
If movie night is a regular event with your family or friend group, different group members can take turns picking the movie each time., Ideally, it should be a relatively quiet space with curtains or blinds that allow you to block out light.If you have a basement, consider using it as your “home theater.”
Your room could also work as your ""home theater."" Watching a movie from your bed is a super comfy option.

, Of course, your home theater will need a screen to display your movie. Flat screen TVs work best for areas with ambient light, like a living room. However, if you have a dedicated home theater in a darker area of the house, consider investing in a projector.Projectors can create a movie theater-like experience. Pick a room with enough wall space for a 100 inch screen, and one that’s large enough to set up the projector at the proper distance from the wall.
Conduct online research and talk to professionals to find the right projector or TV for your space.
You don't need a TV or projector to watch a movie. If you are enjoying a movie alone, you can watch directly from your computer or tablet.

, If you want to take your home theater to the next level, consider purchasing speakers. Speakers will enhance the sound quality, creating a more immersive experience.

Consult a professional to determine which speakers would be best for your space and needs. Room size is a major factor. Large speakers don’t work well in small, closed-in rooms, while small speakers may sound weak in large, open rooms.A sound bar is a good option if you want a significant upgrade in sound quality, but aren’t ready to invest in a pricey surround sound speaker system., A good view of the screen is key to enjoying a movie. Make sure the chairs and couches are positioned for a great view. Sitting too close to the screen can be overwhelming, while sitting too far away can make it difficult to see.If you are watching a movie with others, make sure that they can get a decent view from their spots.

, A dark environment is important for an immersive cinematic experience. Turn off or dim your overhead lights and lamps, and close curtains and shades if it’s light outside., Light and sounds from a phone can be extremely distracting, as you probably know from your local movie theater. Turn off or silence your phone, and have others do the same.One option is to have your fellow movie watchers place their phones in a bowl in the center of the room. The first one to grab their phone has to refill everyone's drinks and snacks for the rest of the night.

, One of the best things about watching a movie at home is the added comfort. Put on your comfiest lounge wear, and bring extra blankets and pillows for an super cozy feel.If you are enjoying your movie with others, ask them to bring extra blankets and pillows. You can never have too many!

, To avoid untimely spills in the middle of your flick, choose bottled drinks. This is especially important if you are watching with spill-prone kids.For an environmentally-friendly alternative to disposable plastic bottles, pour drinks into refillable bottles and sip away.

, Finger foods are easy to eat while lounging on the couch. Popcorn is classic movie snack. Pretzels, candy, and chips with dip are other movie-friendly options.Try spicing up regular popcorn. Add seasoning, like cayenne pepper, or drizzle your popcorn with caramel for a sweeter snack.
If you’re looking for a healthier finger food option, try fresh fruit!

, If your movie is especially long or you are watching with antsy kids, scheduling a brief intermission is probably a good idea. Pause the movie at the halfway point so everyone can take a bathroom break and grab extra drinks and snacks."

Get your instrument appraised.,
Examine the market value of similar instruments.,
Assess the condition of your musical instrument.,
Determine whether your instrument qualifies as antique.,
Set a price for your instrument.,
Find a proper place to sell your instrument.,
Advertise effectively.,
Seek buyers.,
Ship instruments carefully.",How to Buy and Sell Musical Instruments2," In order to know how much your instrument is worth, you can visit an appraiser. Some music stores offer cost-free verbal appraisals. The price for an insurance appraisal can vary. For example, it can cost from $75 to $250.Alternatively, you can estimate your instrument’s value on your own.


To find an appraiser in your area (U.S.), visit http://www.appraisersassociation.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.viewpage&pageid=750.
For very valuable instruments, get your instrument authenticated., Each instrument has its own unique value based on several characteristics (age, quality of craftsmanship, condition). Nevertheless, you still can get a gist of the local market. Visit online sites like eBay or Craig’s List to see what prices other people are using.

, Are there any cosmetic issues like scuffs or marks? Is there a problem that makes your instrument function less well, such as missing or damaged keys on a piano or a damaged bow for a violin? Does the instrument still play normally and completely? Any factor that diminishes the condition of the instrument will lower its price. Full functionality is particularly important.

, The best way to do this is by visiting an appraiser. Still, you can do a bit of research to determine this factor yourself. Do you have the original case? Are there etchings on the instrument that note a manufacturer or year?


Once you locate a manufacturer’s mark, perform an online search to see what information you can find.
For example, if your piano is a Steinway, locate the serial number by lifting up the cover. Once you locate the number, you can contact Steinway for all the available details (place of sale, age, model, etc.). This service costs $50.For tips on determining the date of your guitar, see Find Out the Age and Value of a Guitar.
Use industry periodicals to find out about common pricing for collectibles.

, Based on all the information you have gathered, formulate a price range in your mind. You will want to set your price towards the higher end of your scale because people likely will negotiate your price downwards. Don't just accept any price that someone offers.


When selling on an auction site like eBay, you might consider having a lower starting price to accrue more bids., The quality of your instrument might determine what portal is best for you to use. For beginner to intermediate level instruments, online sites like Craigslist or eBay can be great. For intermediate to expert level instruments, ask at your local music store whether they buy instruments. Auction houses often will sell higher quality instruments as well. Use your local newspaper’s print and online classified sections to advertise. If you belong to any musical professional associations, their magazines also might have classified sections.


For tips on selling your piano online, see Sell a Piano Online.
Auction houses are particularly interested in very valuable instruments like Stradivarius violins.
Ask instrument repair people if they buy instruments. Some repair technicians will buy used instruments for their parts.Use a consignment shop. The shop displays your instrument in the store and receives a commission for the sale.
Consider selling at flea markets. If you have older instruments for which you don't want to fetch too high of a price, consider selling at your local flea market.

, In your print or online listing, provide photographs of your instrument from every angle. Make sure your photo background is professional and the room is well lit.In today’s digital age, you also might be able to upload a sound file of your instrument being played. Give relevant information about the quality of the instrument, its manufacturer, age, condition, functionality, and quality. Mention your instrument's dimensions and weight in the listing. Offer interested parties the chance to play the instrument before purchase.


Make sure your listing is easy to read, clearly spaced, and printed in an easy font. Use bullet points for organization.Provide relevant details about the instrument that can enhance its value.If you are willing to deliver, specify that as well.
Use listing title keywords wisely. When advertising online, use the listing's title's keywords to attract the right customers. For example, if you have a beginner's trumpet for sale, rather than writing ""brass trumpet for sale"" as a headline, try, ""beginner's brass trumpet for sale--good condition, perfect for a middle schooler starting band class."" If listing a piano, mention the brand name, condition, and the size in your listing. For instance, you could write, ""Baby grand, black Steinway piano: gently used condition."", Find places where others look to buy instruments and advertise yours for sale. For example, you might advertise at a local school, church, or community center on a bulletin board. Ask friends for recommendations of people who might be looking for an instrument. Follow up with any interested buyers and offer a brochure on your instrument with all relevant information (make, age, condition, etc.).

, After you have sold your instrument, be sure to pack it with bubble wrap and other products like foam that can protect the instrument. Tightly pack the instrument so that it cannot shift in the box. Ensure that the instrument will not be damaged by water."

Take good care of your instrument.,
Conduct regular maintenance.,
Use the instrument regularly.,
Store instruments well.",How to Buy and Sell Musical Instruments3," If you plan to sell your instrument in the future, it is wise to protect it now. Perform regular cleaning, oiling, and maintenance of your instruments to ensure longevity. If you have a large instrument like a piano, keep it in a climate controlled space. Large fluctuations in temperature or humidity can harm your instrument.Always shut all the latches on instrument cases so your instrument doesn’t fall out.For brass instruments, do not set your instrument on its bell. Instead lay it on its side with the valve side facing upwards.Clean brass mouthpieces weekly with a mild soap and mouthpiece brush.Oil brass valves and lead pipes weekly.Bathe brass instruments two to three times yearly.Oil the insides and outsides of wooden instruments.Keep drinks off any instrument with a wood finish.Clean wooden instruments with a dry or damp cloth. Swab woodwind instruments after each use, to remove moisture from condensation.

, Have an expert inspect your instrument periodically for any defects or problems. Think of this as a regular check-up. Also bring your instrument to a specialist if you notice it is sounding differently. If you damage any part of the instrument, bring it in for service.


Service your pianos two to four times per year., If you have an instrument, play it. While this might seem simple, it is essential. You will notice problems with your instruments sooner if you are using them. Particularly for brass and woodwinds, regular playing and maintenance will keep your instruments fitter.


If you no longer play your instrument, consider loaning it to a neighborhood child or giving it to an instrument drive (if it is not extremely valuable).

, If you must store instruments for a long period of time, cover any larger instruments like pianos with cloths. Place instruments in their intended cases if applicable. Cover instruments with protective cloths or blankets. Look for a storage space with a constant temperature. Avoid direct sunlight.Store violins in rooms with medium humidity and a constant temperature.Avoid storing instruments in damp basements or hot attics.
Remove mouthpieces from woodwinds or brass instruments.

Assess your budget.,
Determine which size of conga you want.,
Decide whether you would prefer a wood or fiberglass shell.,
Decide whether you want synthetic or natural heads.,
Browse for congas at music retailers or secondhand stores.",How to Buy a Conga Drum," Congas can range in price dramatically between low-end and high-end models. Generally, higher-end congas will sound and feel better, which can lead to a more enjoyable time learning basic technique. For this reason, it may be preferable to purchase a single high-end conga as opposed to buying a set of 2 or 3 cheaper models. You can always expand your collection later.;
, Congas are available in 3 distinct sizes (as determined by the diameter of the drumhead). From smallest to largest, they are referred to as the quinto, the conga, and the tumba. These drums are typically played in sets of 2 or 3. However, if you can only afford a single drum, buy the conga size, as it is the most versatile.


Occasionally you will see ""requinto"" drums that are even smaller than the quinto, or ""super tumba"" drums that are bigger than the tumba. These are rarer, specialty drums that shouldn't be considered by a novice player.

, The body of the conga, the drum shell, will either be made from wood or fiberglass.


Wood is the traditional material, and lends a warm, full tone to the drums. It is preferred by most professionals, and is widely used on high-end models. The drawback to wood congas is that they don't project very loudly without the use of proper technique.
Fiberglass congas are cheaper and more durable than their wood counterparts. They tend to have a thinner, brighter tone quality, but are more forgiving for novice players due to their clear projection.

, The drum head (sometimes called a ""skin"") is the stretched membrane that you actually touch with your hands during play.


Traditionally, conga heads are made from animal skin. Rawhide is the standard, but very high-end models will feature buffalo skin. These heads lend a full, warm tone to the drum that complements a wood shell nicely.
An alternative to a natural head is a synthetic head. These heads are made to mimic the tone of animal skin heads, but are cheaper and more durable. While the tone of these heads can be a bit thin, they do have a crisper, brighter projection, which suits them well to novice players.

, After deciding on your desired specs, you can browse for congas. Online music retailers like Sam Ash and Musician's Friend will carry a wide selection of congas and allow you to read customer reviews. Classifieds sites or secondhand stores are an option if your budget is low - sometimes a used high-end conga can be purchased for less than a new budget model. Popular conga manufacturers are LP, Toca, and Remo.

Know the parts of your flute.,
Handle your flute carefully.,
Regularly clean your flute inside and out.,
Keep the keys clean.",How to Care for Your Flute," In order to maintain your flute, you need to be familiar with its parts. There are three joints:


the headjoint: the piece that creates the majority of the sound

the body: the piece where most of the keys are, and

the footjoint: the short end piece with a few important keys;
, You must always be careful when doing any activity where you are not playing, such as holding or walking with your flute in hand, or even setting it on a chair.

When placing your flute on a chair, disassemble it so that it doesn't roll off. Carefully set the pieces down, and make sure nobody sits on it!
When holding your flute, you should not hold the keys or the rod down. This could damage the keys. You want to hold it in an area where you are not touching any keys.
Be extra careful when walking with your flute in hand, especially in tight quarters, as flutes are long.

, Part of caring for a flute is cleaning it. After each time you play, you need to clean out your flute. If you don't, it can cause the keys to fill with dirt and grime, and can even cause keys to fall off. You can use a cleaning rod with a clean fabric, or you can buy a fluffy rod from music stores (it's basically a plastic stick with ""fluff"" on it to properly clean a flute). Use a different cloth to polish the outside to keep it shiny. Always remember to be gentle with your flute (don't hold the keys!)., Dirty, sticky keys make your flute harder to play. One thing a lot of flute players do not use, or even know about, is powder papers. They can be bought at music stores, and are used to clean the keys so that they don't become sticky. All you have to do is press the key over the paper gently a few times on each key, and you should be fine."

They aren't hard to find either. Not only are there sites dedicated to film reviews, but there are also general pop culture sites that contain film reviews. These websites don’t just tell you which films are worth watching and which aren’t. They also give recommendations as well. For example, The AV Club has a Watch This! film recommendation every week where they highlight a particular film and talk about its merits.Be sure to browse newspaper film review sections. Most major newspapers have sections where they cover films. These sections usually feature a selection of contemporary film reviews each week.;
, You might have a film in mind, but want to know what the general consensus about that film is. This is where a review aggregator comes in. A site like Rotten Tomatoes or Metacritic collects reviews from different sources both offline and online.Usually they will give you a pretty good idea of what the general opinion of a film is.


Use an aggregator as a guide. Review aggregators are like a thermometer which gives you a read on how the public viewed a film. This means that films that starkly divide audiences will seem like they received a lukewarm reception. Don't take the aggregator’s grade as a final judgment about a film’s quality.

, With the advent of the internet, now every film buff can talk about what they think about classic and contemporary pictures. These places exist so that like-minded people can debate classic flicks and modern favorites. Sites like Letterboxd and IMDb allow users to talk about their favorite films. These are great places to find out about obscurities and classics.


You might try searching for your favorite film, then looking to see if there are any lists that contain that film. When you find a list that contains your film, see if there are any other films on the list that interest you. Add those movies to your to-watch list.

, It can be difficult to figure out what films to watch due to the sheer amount of films that have been produced. Thankfully, there are lists of film classics that are available online and offline. For example, you might peruse Roger Ebert’s list of great movies on his website.Browse DVD collections. There are companies that release DVDs of important films. The Masters of Cinema and Criterion Collection often release films that are of significance and value.You can find both interesting and entertaining fare by looking through the different films they have released.
Look through film magazines. Sight and Sound maintains a list of the best two hundred and fifty films ever made with input from directors, critics, and academics from around the world. The Cahiers du Cinema has top ten lists from every year that it has been in operation.These are good starting points for when you are trying to find an excellent film.
Go through the filmographies of great directors. There are directors who have, in the short time that this medium has existed, managed to make unforgettable films. These directors generally have made several fantastic films. Usually, you can find the names of these directors by looking at lists of classic films. Pick a director that you like, and try to watch as many films by them as you can.

, If you see a film mentioned that you think you will enjoy, you may want to remember the name so you can find it later. The best way to do this is to jot down a note about its title and when it was made.


Keep a film diary. Sometimes you’ve seen a film that you want to show to someone, but you have completely forgotten what it was called. To avoid this, create a diary for the films that you watch. Every time you see a movie, good or bad, make sure that you mark down its name and who directed it for further reference.

, This is incredibly important. How people in the room feel will determine how the movie will be received. For example, you probably don’t want to show your favorite comedy to a room of depressed people. Therefore, you should try to figure out how people are feeling before you come to a final decision about the movie that you are going to choose.


You can do this by suggesting different movies to the people in your group. Choose your movie based on what they seem to be receptive to.
For example, if everyone you ask seems to be in the mood for a scary film, then you can show them Halloween directed by John Carpenter.

, A movie’s effect depends on several factors. Location is definitely one of them. Watching a film at home is simply different from watching a film at the movie theater. When you are figuring out what to watch, think about where you are going to watch it. For example, when you’re on the plane home, you may not want to watch that latest blockbuster because you are staring at such a tiny screen. Or, if you are going to be projecting a film outdoors in the summer, then you may want to pick a film that fits that atmosphere.


If you are projecting a film outside, you should try a funny screwball comedy from the 1940s. For example, you can show Bringing Up Baby, which is a hilarious comedy starring Cary Grant as a repressed paleontologist and Katherine Hepburn as a zany socialite. Not only is the film funny, but it can be enjoyed by people of all ages.
For a movie night at a home theater, you could try Edge of Tomorrow, which stars Tom Cruise as a military publicist who repeatedly has to learn how to be a hero., Film-watching is a collaborative experience. Therefore, you are going to be choosing a film with other people. You need to think about what they want to see. This means you may have to compromise. For example, if your friend wants to watch a drama, and you want to watch a comedy, then it may be best to watch a drama with comic elements.


For example, you could watch The Royal Tenenbaums, an ensemble family drama with light moments of humor, directed by Wes Anderson.Perhaps you are selecting a movie for children. Then, you need to figure out not only what they want to watch, but also what is appropriate for them to see. This is when movie ratings can be helpful.

, Make a list of five to ten movies that you feel are appropriate for your situation, audience, and mood. Then, you should talk to the other people that you are going to watch the movie with. Ask them how they feel about each movie. After noting their responses, you can pick a film that you know you all will enjoy.


Of course, you won’t always please everybody. However, they will be glad that you took their input into account.

Check the Internet for some info or trivia that you may have missed.,
Repeat this process for quite a while.",How to Become a Film Buff," There are many available online or at bookstores. You can start with Roger Ebert and Leonard Maltin if you wish, but if you really want to be familiar with more obscure films, try something more comprehensive. The Time-Out Film Guide is a great resource, and it's widely available.Try a 1001 movies you must see before you die.;
, Don't look for exciting plots or melodrama, but rather see what the aesthetic appeals of the film are: visual beauty, quality of acting, screenplay, the film's overall meaning and depth, etc.

, Even ones that look only mildly interesting. Sometimes they surprise you. Don´t limit yourself to one or two movie genres; you will be the best if you have seen a good number of movies with a variety of themes. Be sure to include both current films playing in theatres, as well as films released on DVDs and video tapes. Be sure to include older movies and foreign films, too; there can be some gems among both categories.

,, You can watch movies as many times as you wish if you own them. Repeated viewings allow you to see things in the film that you may have missed the first time that you watched it. Details are often lost when you are trying to take the film in for the first time. Watching for details can help you familiarize yourself with directors' trademarks, and they give the film more meaning.

IMDB now has parental advisory content in case you plan on taking your kid(s) to a movie.

"
Study the major characters appearing in the scene.",How to Analyze a Scene in a Film1," Also look for extras (supporting actors who don't speak) and bit players (supporting actors who have a few lines of dialog).


Note which characters are in the scene at the start, who arrives later and who leaves before the scene ends.
Ask yourself what each character wants and whether the character gets what he or she wants.
Watch for status changes. In most scenes, the statuses of some of the characters will change. For instance in a scene where ""John"" asks for a favor from ""Larry"" and is refused, ""John"" has low status and ""Larry"" has high status. If ""John"" then pulls out a gun and forces ""Larry"" to perform the favor, ""John"" becomes the character with high status.
Identify how the casting of particular actors influence how you see the characters.
Study the characters' costumes and ask yourself what the costumes tell you about the characters.;
"
"
Take note of where the scene takes place, both in terms of the place and the time.",How to Analyze a Scene in a Film2," In particular, note when the scene occurs within the timeline of the movie and whether the scene depicts events out of order.


Many movies have scenes that occur out of order, such as when the character is remembering or relaying events that happened at another time (a flashback) or because the director has made the creative choice to show events out of order. Usually, even though the events are out of order, the story itself is told in a straightforward manner from the first scene to the last scene.
As it relates to the story, ask yourself why the scene is taking place where it is and whether it helps to tell the story or distracts from it.
The setting may have been chosen by the director for reasons other than telling the story. Try to determine if the setting is important to the story or just interesting to the director.

"
"
Pay careful attention to how what you see in the scene helps to tell the story.",How to Analyze a Scene in a Film3," This is called the mise-en-scene, a French term that roughly translates to visual storytelling.


Keeping in mind that what you see in the scene is not the entire location but only what the director has decided to show, ask yourself why the director chose to show this part of the location and not another. This works equally well for scenes shot on a sound stage rather than on location, because the set will only comprise a part of the location it represents.
Note which characters and objects are in the center of the scene and which are in the background or periphery.
Study which parts of the scene are out of focus and whether this changes during the scene.
Pay attention to how the scene is lit. Note whether it is brightly lit or in shadow and whether the light has a particular hue. Think about how the scene might play if the lighting is changed.

"
"
Make a list of every camera shot.",How to Analyze a Scene in a Film4," A typical scene can include dozens of shots, from close-ups on a character's face to extreme long shots showing the entire scene from a great distance. There are also shots during which the camera moves, tracking the movements of a character or zooming in on an object. Each is meant to serve a purpose in telling the story.


Note whether the camera is acting as the eyes of a character or is simply watching the scene being shot.
Try to determine why the director choose each shot, and what the effect of each shot is.
Pay particular attention to unusual camera shots, such as slow motion, tilted shots or shots where the camera is allowed to shake. For example, a tilted camera shot is often used to suggest that the character represented by the camera is drugged.
Think about how the camera shots affect the pace of the scene.

"
"
Close your eyes and concentrate on what you hear during the scene.,
Note whether the scene is narrated and determine why the director included narration.

",How to Analyze a Scene in a Film5," Many scenes have several ""layers"" of sounds and music, from ambient sounds that might actually be heard at that location, such as traffic or birds, to sounds that are inserted to help create a mood. Many scenes also include music that helps to tell the story.


Keep in mind that the director may have deliberately taken out any true ambient sounds and inserted others. Imagine what you might actually hear at the scene's location and whether the director made a good choice in the sounds he or she included.
Take note if the director inserted sounds to evoke a particular emotion from the audience. For instance, a beat or ticking clock creates a sense of urgency or dread.
Listen to the music and ask yourself what it represents and whether it tells you what to expect. For example, a composer might create a particular melody that you will hear whenever a character is thinking about his lost love.
Determine whether the movie contains original music or music the director has licensed from another artist. Ask yourself why the director chose one or the other (or both).
Close your eyes and listen to music. Try to guess what is happening by what you hear.

Wrap it up.",How to Analyze a Movie," If you’ve never seen the movie you want to analyze before, don’t do a ton of research beforehand. You want to go into the movie and let it make its impression on you, not the other way around. It’s good to know some very simple background information, but otherwise, try to let the film speak for itself.


Some of the basics you will want to know include: the year and place the movie was made; the studio that sponsored it; and its director, main actors, and writers.
Try to avoid reading reviews or spoilers before the movie; they can bias you.Even trailers can make you judge a movie before you see it.;
, You are going to want to focus in-depth on the movie so that you can write a good analysis later, and it’s best to do that without any distractions. Some people find it intimidating to go to the movies alone, but you may find that's it's actually fun and helps you focus better on the things that matter.If you feel like you must go with a friend, pick a thoughtful one. Someone who squirms or makes jokes all the time will distract you.

, Unlike television shows, movies are meant to be seen all at once.If you interrupt the flow of the movie to get a snack or run around the block, you won’t have the experience the creators intended you to have. Sit still, and hit pause as little as possible.

, If you aren’t in a dark theatre, you can scribble down a few observations to yourself as the movie unfolds. However, your focus should be on the movie, not on your writing, so don’t get too caught up in doing an in-depth analysis right there in your seat. You can do that later! Make sure you don’t pause.Some things you may want to jot down, especially if they catch your attention, include:


Major plot points.
Crucial or repeated lines.
Particularly notable shots.

, While the credits are rolling and your brain is still fresh, record everything that struck you about the movie or felt significant.You don’t have to organize these thoughts into categories yet, so just make a point of focusing on things you thought were interesting, or emphasized by the filmmakers. If you’re stuck for ideas, try thinking about…


...the way color was used.
...whether the shots flowed together or were jarring.
...if particular characters or things were supposed to represent certain things.

, After a day or so, review the notes you took during and after the movie. Think about if any of the things you focused on seemed to be bigger issues throughout the movie, from a theme of self-sacrifice to the fact that only evil characters wear hats. Once you’ve identified the themes that seem most important, you can start breaking down the movie to look for evidence in each of its elements.

, Any given movie contains at least two stories: the narrative it tells, and the background of its creation. Movies take a lot of time, effort, and money to make. Learning a bit about how the film you’re trying to analyze was made will give you a lot of insight into it.


Are there any myths about the movie’s creation? For example, The Wizard of Oz has a ton of urban legends surrounding it.Even if the legends aren’t true, they may tell you about the movie’s mystique or fan base.
Did the filmmakers intend for the movie to comment on contemporary politics or culture? For instance, Dr. Strangelove was made in the 1960s and satirized the Cold War that the United States was embroiled in.Was the movie based on a true story, fiction, or a mix of the two? For example, the 1977 TV series Roots explores the family history of writer Alex Haley. Even though real people and events are present, the story is fleshed out with fictionalized characters and side events., Movies are a storytelling medium, and the success of a film depends on the structure of the story. Think about the pacing of the story and whether it's choppy or smooth. Make note of any major plot twists, too.


If you want to figure out if a movie was well-plotted, write down the major events of the plot as you remember them. If you can remember them in order, that’s a good sign.
Most movie plots follow the same structure: setup, to new situation, to progress, to higher stakes, to final push, to resolution., The writing of a movie supports the story, so a well-plotted movie is often well-written as well. Try to figure out if you got all the information you needed from the writing. Make a list of any notable quotes or phrases.


Does the dialogue sound believable, like real people talking?Even in movies that take place in the past, you should not be so distracted by old-timey grammar that you can’t follow the story.
Try to tell where the jokes are, and if they land well. (You can easily tell this in a theatre--if you hear other people laughing, it means the joke worked.)
Make note of moments of silence. These can say as much as words do.

, Think about the characters for a moment. Are they believable? This does not mean whether you like the character portrayed or not, but refers instead to whether the acting helped you to believe the characters were real. Just as important is an actor’s presence on the screen. If an actor commands your attention so that you can’t look away, they’re probably performing well.Are accents and speech patterns consistent throughout the movie? Do they provide additional information, or are they distracting?How do the actors convey information using their bodies and faces? , A horror movie might use a shaky camera and dim light to express authenticity. A blockbuster might rely on bright lighting that makes the actors look flawless, and smooth cuts from shot to shot. Try to identify the mood you get from looking at a particular scene, then identify the camera and lighting work that is making you feel that way.Angles are important too: they show you where the director would want you positioned in a scene. Does the angle make you feel like you’re looking down on people, or backed up into a corner?, Movie soundtracks are an accessible way for all types of people to engage with music--even orchestral music! Think about the soundtrack's volume, mood, and importance to the plot. A good soundtrack will deepen the mood of the movie that you're watching and may even advance the plot. It should not be distracting.


Horror movies are well-known for their atmospheric soundtracks, which can make a tense environment even scarier. The Shining is a famous example of this: with the music turned off, some of the most terrifying scenes don't seem so bad.Some period movies like A Knight’s Tale, or Sofia Coppola’s Marie Antoinette, use contemporary music to help audiences better empathize with historic figures., The inanimate objects used to set the proper mood for a movie can tell you a lot about it too. Is the director of the movie known for a particular aesthetic? Do you feel a specific way when you look at the sets? Is this the type of movie in which the plot doesn’t matter because the accessories are so fabulous?


Look at the costumes. Clothes are an easy way to set a movie in a particular time or place, but if they’re not accurate, they can detract from the film.Examine the outfits the characters wear carefully, and try to figure out if they do any visual storytelling of their own.
Sets are powerful too. Many films shoot for hyper realistic sets, while others have more basic backdrops. Some directors even choose sets that look like theatre stages as a deliberate choice., You want facts that support your concept of its themes, which could be concepts, colors, or even repeated images or lines of dialogue throughout the film. Look over your thoughts on the different elements of the movie and see if you can find support for your thoughts.


For instance, if you're analyzing the 1995 Disney movie Aladdin, you might think about how Aladdin craves both freedom (from hunger, prison, and poverty) and power throughout the movie, and how other characters' desires for freedom or power shape them as well. You might think about how Aladdin and Jasmine each describe themselves as ""trapped"" at first, despite their different circumstances, and how the Genie is happy to trade physical strength for a vacation at the end.
Pick the themes that resonate with you. The best writing comes from enthusiasm, so channel what excites you into your work.
Remember that directors don’t necessarily put themes in on purpose. For instance, many critics felt that objectification of women was a theme throughout Transformers, but it’s unlikely that the director consciously chose to do this., Now that you’ve made all your judgements of the movie, it’s time to help others do the same. Mention the background of the film, including the people involved in making it, and make a note of any expectations you had going in. At this point, you can hint as to your theories about the movie, but there’s no need to hit your readers over the head with them.In your analysis of Aladdin, you would want readers to know that the movie's story is based off of a cycle of legends called the 1001 Nights and that its images are inspired by an earlier, unfinished movie called The Thief and the Cobbler., Take a sentence or three to explain the setup of the plot and the seeds of the major conflict. Try to be as brief as possible: plot is but one small aspect of the movie, and you have a lot of ground to cover.To summarize Aladdin, you'd want to say that it's the story of a clever young man whose life changes forever when an encounter with a Genie grants him incredible power and privilege--though not without a cost.
It should go without saying, but if you're writing a review, no spoilers. Don’t describe any major twists or resolutions.
If you're writing a more formal analysis for class, it's okay to explain the whole plot.
Don’t get too snarky. A joke or two is fine.

, Once you’ve gone into the bones of the movie, you can tell your reader about the layers on top of them. Pose a hypothesis about what you think the filmmaker is trying to say, or even what the filmmaker wants you to think. Identify examples of elements in the movie that prove your point.


In the story of Aladdin, you could make the argument that power is a trap. Both Jasmine and the Sultan are royalty, but their lives are ruled by antiquated marriage laws and Jafar, a vizier who towers over both of them. Both Jafar and Aladdin use the Genie to gain great temporary control, but these new powers are capricious. Jafar is defeated by his power: he turns into a genie and is imprisoned in a lamp. By the end, Jasmine has been freed to marry who she wants, and Aladdin has chosen to free the Genie, as he promised. The characters who choose their own freedom--and prioritize others' freedom at the expense of their own power--are rewarded.
You don’t have to tie all your observations back to a simple thesis, necessarily. However, it’s good to stay on task.

, Don't be afraid to criticize. There are very few perfect films, and a nuanced discussion of the film’s flaws will add strength to your analysis. Go ahead and say what would you change about the movie. Are there any ways in which it could support its themes better?, Did the film meet expectations? What is your overall verdict? Use your opinion backed up by analysis and facts. Obviously, this is your review, and it can’t be objective: express whether you think the movie succeeded at its aims, and whether you enjoyed it.


In the conclusion of your analysis of Aladdin, you might decide that its emphasis on the joys of freedom resonated with you and made the movie a popular hit, but you were troubled about how casual the protagonist was about making weaker or indentured characters (like the monkey, carpet, and Genie) do his work for him.
Overall, do you think the movie was a success? Can you imagine the filmmakers exploring similar visions later?
If you’re writing an accessible review for a large audience, feel free to make a recommendation about what types of people might be interested in the movie (costume fans, classical music buffs, people who like watching things blow up…)

Study acting styles.",How to Be a Cinephile," One way to develop an appreciation for cinema is to watch a lot of different ones. For example, IMDB has compiled a list of moves that all cinephiles should watch.Set up a weekly schedule to make sure you watch this many movies the next 12 months.


For example, you could make a goal of watching two films per week.
You could follow the IMBD list, or compile your own list. The goal is to become familiar with many different kinds of movies.;
, Make sure that when making your list of movies, you select ones you wouldn’t normally watch. This is similar to when you are in school and must read books that you would never have picked out. It is an important part of being a well-rounded cinephile.


For example, if you tend to watch only romantic comedies that everyone knows about, watch some foreign films that few have heard of.
Be sure to include films from the past as well as the present. Learning how film has changed over the years also makes you well-rounded.
For example, the job of a film critic is not to like or dislike a film, but to analyze how well it is executed based on a set of standards. View a film with an eye for criticism rather than personal taste., Just as art majors must study the history of art in order to understand modern art, cinephiles should study film history to gain a well-rounded perspective on modern film. Watching the silent film The Great Train Robbery can help you appreciate how much film has changed.You should also watch great historic films like Casablanca, Citizen Kane, or Psycho.
Take film classes in college or community centers to learn what others view as important historical film.

, There are important eras of film just as there are important eras in history. Understanding film eras can help you understand the social context of each film, deepening your appreciation. For example, the silent film era is important for its differences in sound and cinematography from modern film.


It is common to study films by decade, such as 1950s films and 1960s movies., It is also essential to grasp the concept of film genres. Just as there are genres of great literature, there are genres of film. You might study action films, adventure movies, and so on.Other genres include comedy, crime, horror, science fiction, and westerns.

, Film festivals occur all over the world and offer a wide assortment of movies. You can watch the films in theaters during the festival and discuss them afterward with fellow critics and cinephiles. This is a way to increase your knowledge base in just a few days.


The Sedona International Film Festival occurs in Sedona, Arizona,and the famous Sundance Film Festival occurs in cities all over the world., Although in the era of instant video streaming it may be easy to find movies to watch, this doesn’t mean that all movies are worth your time. For example, there are about 3.8 million titles on IMDB (including films, TV shows, etc.).Ask friends for their recommendations and look up cinephile lists online.

, You want a good screen with good sound, whether it’s on a TV or a computer. Since most movies you are likely going to watch will be streaming online, it is important to have a computer or device that is able to play streaming videos without a lot of buffering. You can test your device’s video capability by streaming a YouTube video.


Most computers need an Intel or other PC-based processor and software like Silverlight or the Flash plug in.
Make sure you have a reliable internet connection in combination with a good player., Even though virtually every film ever made is available online for instant streaming, that doesn’t mean you have access to it. Having a DVD player on hand is important for increasing your availability because you never know where you might have to obtain a movie from.


You may want to purchase a DVD player as an individual device that can be hooked up to a TV or computer monitor. Portable DVD players are also available.
Most laptops and desktops have built-in DVD players.
Some older movies may only be available on VHS, so having a VHS player may also be useful. Because this technology is outdated, VHS players are harder to find. You may want to look online or at thrift stores and garage sales, even in classifieds like craigslist.

, There are many online movie services that require a monthly fee for unlimited streaming movies. Every service has their limits, which is why you might consider subscribing to more than one.


Hulu offers a wide variety of films and TV shows, although it is only available in the U.S.Amazon is a similar service and is available in the U.S., U.K., and Germany.Netflix is one of the most popular streaming programs, but its global reach is also limited., Many libraries have a DVD collection (or VHS collection). If you don’t already have one, get a library card.You can search for what movies are available on most library websites, then go in person to pick it up.

, You can also rent movies for a small fee in local movie shops, although stores like this have become rarer as instant streaming becomes more popular. Redbox, a red kiosk available at many convenience stores in the U.S., is often a reliable alternative, but they tend to hold mostly new releases., Breaking down the word into its parts (“cine” and “phile”), you can see that a cinephile is more than just someone who likes movies. A cinephile is passionate about film. They generally choose to study movies whether they like them or not in order to develop a real appreciation for this industry.Greek has four different words for love, and “phileo” is love that is centered around companionship and pleasure derived from friends or objects (or hobbies).Although ""phileo"" is part of the word ""cinephile,"" this does not mean cinephiles love all movies. Rather, they have a passion to understand films in general so they can better critique and discuss them.

, When many people hear the term “cinephile,” they immediately picture a pretentious or snobby individual who bores everyone with their opinions and extensive knowledge. However, a cinephile is not a snob. Snobs define themselves by what they don’t like, whereas cinephiles by what they do like.For example, a cinephile is open to discussing all films, and does not demean others for having different opinions.

, Not only do movies help you become well-rounded and appreciate what you see, they give you subjects of conversation. On one hand, you have a wealth of experience to draw from in order to start quick conversations with anyone. On the other, you are able to connect easily with other cinephiles. This holds true whether you like a film or not.

, Watching films that you would not usually pick out helps you appreciate what you already like even more. Films are often full of references to other films. If you have seen a lot of movies, you will pick up on these references and appreciate them more.For instance, in the 2003 movie Finding Nemo, there is a scene that mimics swarming birds from Alfred Hitchcock’s 1963 The Birds., In most school courses, you are taught how to analyze—texts, numbers, artwork, etc. This is precisely what you need to do to become a cinephile: watch movies and analyze how they approach different themes and techniques. Once you get used to it, you can become good at quickly analyzing films.


Analyzing movies can be very in-depth, just like writing essays analyzing literature can be.
Figure out the theme of the film and break it down.Figure out how the film is related to reality, looking not at the discrepancies between them but how fiction and reality interact.
You may find it useful to watch a movie several times, taking notes on different aspects as you go, in order to become familiar with how to analyze movies.

, There are several different aspects of film that you can study. There are actually college courses or entire degrees that focus on these aspects. One important one is cinematography, or the skill of how a movie is filmed.It can include all visual areas of a movie such as camera angles and how close the camera gets to a subject.Cinematography also includes lighting, color, or anything that you see on the screen.
To study cinematography, it might be useful to check out a book at the library or read blogs about it to learn key terms. These can help you know what to look for when you watch a movie.

, A director is kind of like a book editor. They take the story and direct the actors and settings to match what they like. You can often tell who directed a movie if you are familiar with their directing style. Study directing styles by watching as many movies as you can find by the same director. Pick out the similarities among the films.


For example, director Tim Burton is well known for his bright colors and odd main characters.Sometimes directors will hire the same actors over and over. Many of Tim Burton's films feature Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter.

, Just because a film is animated rather than live action doesn't mean it should not be studied. You can still explore cinematography, directing styles, and elements of acting with animated movies. You should also learn about 2D, 3D, claymation, stop motion, and cel animation techniques.You may also find similar themes or images among animation projects by the same director, such as the appearance of the characters or settings.

, You will also benefit from the study of acting styles to help you on your journey to becoming a cinephile. There are many acting methods used today, and some of them are called by the name of the actors who started them, such as Stanislavski's system or Strasberg's style.If you study these techniques, you may be able to identify them in actors in different movies. This gives you a deeper appreciation for the art of movie-making.

Grow your base.",How to Start a Record Label," For the most effective startup, focus on a particular genre to build your reputation. This focus will be determined in large part by what you wish to accomplish. If your goal is to make a lot of money, then you'll focus on popular music. If your goal is to be the go-to label for 21st century post avant jazzcore, your focus and approach will be much different.;
, This is needed on many levels. First and foremost, you will build the framework of your label: how you plan on finding and developing talent, your marketing and promotion avenues, how you understand the market and the competition, how you plan on financing your venture, and how you intend on making this a profitable business.


If you're independently wealthy, then you may not need investors, at least for the monetary backing. However, you may wish to attract investors who can help you build credibility in your market. For example, if you started a pop music label with your own cash, but were able to convince Sir Paul McCartney to invest in your label, that would be a huge win for your label. To do that, though, you will need a credible plan that shows Sir Paul, or any other investor, that you know what you are doing.
Should you need financial backing, having a plan that shows that you understand both the rewards and the risks, and that you have been able to determine a way forward, will go a long way in convincing an investor to risk his capital on your venture.

, That will include everything from staples to electricity to recording and production costs. Be very thorough when you do this: people who might consider becoming involved in your label will certainly be, when they read your plan! Here are some things to take into account:


Administrative costs: rent, utilities, taxes, and licenses are right up front and can be significant. Don't forget to include phone, internet, printers, paper, computers, business cards, and office supplies in this list. You will also need a website, as well as somebody to both create and maintain it. Some of these costs will be weekly, some monthly, and some that only happen every year or two. It may seem like a lot at first, but if you create a five-year plan, you should be able to chart out how these costs will eventually become a small percentage of the overall financial picture.
Recording costs: as a record label, you're going to be producing acts. That means you need to account for the recording chain, including studio time, the fees for the engineer and producer (which may be you, but you need to get paid too), mixing engineers, and studio musicians.
Marketing budget: a great recording is nothing until it's actually in the market. To do that, you're going to need to promote your label through online ads, magazine ads, press releases, and your website. You will also need to work with artists and designers to create your logo, packaging standards, and overall design plan.
Professional services: while you're busy making beautiful music, somebody needs to take care of writing clear, effective legal contracts both for your talent, and for your business deals. For that, you will want the services of a qualified attorney who specializes in the music business. You'll also want an accountant to make sure that you friendly tax collector doesn't come to call. You need people that you can trust and rely on.

, Planning a cash flow forecast for one, three, and five years out requires some skill, some savvy, and some educated guesswork. The first year should be a very solid plan: you will have a good idea of your startup costs already, and you will likely have in mind (and made contact with) a few bands who will be the first on your roster. Using this information, determine how much you'll be spending, and a projection about how much these acts will bring in.


For example, you can base this on how the bands are doing currently: Do they pack clubs? Their music has a good track record, and will probably perform well. If you also have bands that are brand new, and don't have a fan base to work from, you'll have to do significantly more promotion to get the word out.
As you add more bands to your roster, your income potential will continue to grow. As you plan for years three to five in your forecast, you will need to determine how and when you will add more talent, and how you will promote them. This is where prediction gets a little more complicated: a great band on your roster may make it much easier for you to promote all the bands on your roster. Similarly, a poorly-performing band will be a cash drain that can lead to financial struggles.

, Unless you're supremely talented in sales, marketing, music, business, art, conversation, and moonlight as a lawyer, you're going to want to develop a team. Here are some key skill sets that will enable your success:


Marketing and sales: somebody who can get out there and promote your label, who knows the industry, and has a personal relationship with artists, promoters, and people who like to support the arts financially. This person or persons will be key to your success: they're responsible for bringing talent in, and getting the word out. The better they perform, the more successful you'll be.
Production. You'll need somebody who understands the recording process inside and out, who can find or develop good engineers, mixers, and producers, and who can run a recording session.
Contract help. To keep costs down, at least at first, consider hiring other staff on a per-job basis. This would include logo and graphic design, legal, accounting, engineering, and other needs that only occur from time to time.

, Set up the appropriate business entity for your label so that you can operate legally, and protect yourself as well. You have several options, which may be called different things in different countries, but are functionally the same:


Sole proprietorship. This is the one where you do it all. A sole proprietorship is easy to start, easy to stop, and easy to maintain. You may have consultants or friends who help you out with the many things that need to be done, but at the end of the day, it's all yours. That includes all the profits, and all the liabilities. It offers little incentive for investors, very little protection for you and should your business fail, any business debts will come out of your pocket. If you are planning on making your label a real business, or want to hire people as you grow, this is not the best option.
Limited Liability Corporation (LLC). An LLC is great for a small business. You have the ability to add people to the team as you grow, and it offers personal liability protection should the business fail. It also provides for relatively easy and flexible control over finances, legal, and tax issues. If you plan on seeking investors, or are international in scope, this is not a good option.
Corporation (You, Inc.). If you are planning to make this a major business venture, are going to be seeking investors, and who like a formal structure, this is the way to go. As with LLCs, you are protected from liability for business losses. You can issue shares of stock, raise investment capital, and have decades of legal precedents to call on when necessary. There are strict rules of organization, and your accountant—as well as your attorney—will be kept busy with taxes, fees, reports, and filings. If you are the casual, laid-back type, this is not the best option for you unless you are ready to pick up the pace.

, With your plan in place, your business in order, licenses and permits applied for and granted, and your production art created and approved, and (hopefully) some investment capital to get you rolling, it's time to get to work!

, Watch the audience and see how they react to the band. If they are up on their feet from the start, and swooning over the band, you might be on to something!


Approach the band and talk with them. Find out who they are, how long they've been together, have they released any music, and what their plans are for the future.
Most importantly, find out if they've been signed to a label already. That may not be a show-stopper, but for starting a record label, you might want to pick a band that's not already signed!

, Your town is loaded with writers who will help you get the word out, but they have to know you. Search for them in the local papers, or local music blogs, and make contact. Invite them to lunch, or to your studio (or to the studio you like to use), and keep in touch with them.

, Find the local recording studios in your area, and visit them. Some may be extravagant, high-end studios, and many will be modest one- or two-room affairs, with varying equipment standards. While that is certainly something to consider, more important is the quality of music that comes out of their speakers.


Get to know the engineers, and talk to them about their recording philosophy, how they relate to bands, and what irks them. This is good to know if, for example, you have a rap artist you think will be a hit, and the engineer absolutely hates rap. Ask them to play some of their favorite cuts, and listen carefully.
To be really thorough, ask them for a CD of some of their work so that you can also listen on your home speakers. Though it's rare, what sounds mind-blowing in a million-dollar studio might sound like it was recorded in the back seat of a Gremlin when taken out of the studio environment.

, Big or small, they are there to sell recordings. When you get to know them, they may well be happy to sell your recordings as well. It's a small venue in the grand scheme of things, but when you're getting started, there's no venue that's too small.

, These are the people who have their fingers on the pulse of the local music industry. The bands that have signed an agent have passed a certain threshold of legitimacy, simply by being professional enough to hire an agent.


If your services show well to agents and promoters, the next time one of their bands says, ""Hey (name), I think we're ready to record an album,"" That person will say, ""I know just the place!""

, Once you've got the practical business matters well in hand, cultivate and maintain the aesthetic layers of your record label. Create a logo and make sure you use your logo and ""look"" on your physical labels, on your website, and on all stationary, t-shirts, mugs, etc. Sign bands and acts that fit in with the particular image you hope to cultivate.


Check out successful DIY labels Sub Pop and Matador records for examples of brand management, who maintain a fiercely independent business model that's also quite diverse.

, Over the last ten years, the Internet has drastically changed the way music is purchased, listened to, and distributed. You may face a hard road to success if you're using the traditional model of touring and relying on CD sales and radio play. YouTube videos and pay-what-you-want models are increasingly popular in maintaining the success of your brand.


Consider promotional gimmicks, like printing t-shirts with the download code for a label mixtape on the tag. Goner records, a Memphis-based garage/punk label, even offered free 7-inch records to anyone who got ""Goner"" tattooed to their body and showed it at the store.

, Sub Pop started by focusing on local Pacific Northwest grunge bands, but now features a diverse array of more mainstream sounds, like Iron & Wine and Fleet Foxes. With this expansion of the kinds of sounds they embrace, their success and share of the market has grown considerably. Even if you're focusing right now on tween pop stars, consider taking ways in which you might crossover and fit other sounds and images into your brand.


In the early 90's, major labels were much more willing to take risks on unknown or ""underground"" acts. Sonic Youth, a noisy independent art band from New York, found themselves in a unique position after being offered a big deal by Geffen, and the signing was applauded by both label executives and music fans. If your label is bringing in money, consider throwing a curveball by releasing a project from left field.

Protect the records from dust.,
Protect the records from heat.,
Store records vertically.This is the best position to minimize damage - keep them upright and do not cram them too closely together in the storage container.,
Handle records with care.,
Clean your vinyl records regularly.,
Take extra special care of shellac records.,
Place cleaned records in a clean sleeve.,
Ensure that your record player is in good condition.",How to Keep a Record Collection Safe," Store each record in its original lightweight cardboard cover or in plastic record sleeves. Look for acid-free plastic sleeves if you haven't already got some.;
, Heat is a record's enemy and will warp records.Store records away from heating sources, such as baseboards, open fires, potbelly stoves, heaters, etc. Also store away from damp areas, as humidity will provide a fertile ground for mold growth, which can destroy your limited edition covers.Keep records away from direct sunlight. Sunlight will damage records both from heat and UV rays.If you do have a warped record from overheating, you can try this remedy: Put it between two thick pieces of plate glass and place heavy books on top of the glass. When doing this, take the cardboard cover off but leave the protective sleeve in place.While this may not work, given that the warped record is no longer any use to you, it's worth a try. If it doesn't mend, try making a Salvador Dali clock out of it!

, Some collectors also insist on storing records in a relatively airtight container or cabinet as additional protection, along with regularly vacuuming around them to keep the records dust-free., Obviously they are fragile and will break when dropped. However, even holding them with care can cause problems as the oils from your fingers are left behind and build up over time, so it's important to hold records by the sides or the center label only., Keeping your records clean will minimize the potential for damage from dust and other particles which could result in scratching. For cleaning:


Obtain a soft, lint-free cleaning cloth. Soft cotton or muslin are good choices.
Dampen the cloth with a cleaning mixture made from 1 part isopropyl alcohol and 4 parts distilled water (20 percent isopropyl to 80 percent water).Note: Do not use this mixture on 78s because they're made from shellac - see next step.
Wipe in a gentle circular motion from the edge to the middle or vice versa.
Allow to air dry.

, Any records made from shellac must not be cleaned using alcohol. Very early versions should be cleaned either professionally, or using professional cleaning solutions specifically made for this purpose because the earliest shellac records are very porous.For a shellac record that you think is older and a little more resilient, try a gentle dish washing liquid that has been heavily diluted, and apply with a fine bristle record brush to lift the dirt. Don't get the label wet, at all. Rinse and pat dry with a towel, then air dry on a dish rack (which takes some time, so be patient).

, That way, you won't transfer back any of the old dirt.

, A poorly maintained record player can harm your records. Keep the needle sharp and keep the turntable clean as well.

Look for the tonic note.The tonic in a key signature refers to the root note that the rest of the scale is based on.,
Spot the chords in use.,
Refer to the Circle of Fifths.,
Identify the final note in a song.In many cases, the final note in a song will bring the composition back to its root tonic note.,
Play a bit of the song.",How to Work Out Which Key You're In1," Tonic is important because any given set of sharps and flats could correspond either to a Major or Minor key. The first note of a tonic note is often (but not always) the tonic note. If there is a chord that the rest of the composition appears built around, the tonic note is probably the root note of that chord.


The tonic note in C Major is C, for instance.
This is especially important if there are no flats or sharps in the notation. Purely natural notation will either be keyed in C Major or A Minor. Look for patterns building around one of these two notes.;
, Musical keys have chords that suit them. Look at the notation and identify the chords in use. Next, you can use a chord map to associate the chords with a key. Chord maps are a dictionary of the chords that apply to a given key. Identifying three or so chords should give you enough ammunition to figure out the key with a chord map.


Chord maps outline the chords of each key clearly.For example, the chords in the key of C are: C Major, D Minor, E Minor, F Major, G Major, and A Minor.

, The Circle of Fifths is a shorthand way of remembering the sharps and flats in a given Major key.In many ways, it's the most important tool in Western music theory. To know how many sharps there are in a key, count the number of spaces between a note clockwise from C. C is at the top of the Circle of Fifths, making it easy to count. Take the number of sharps and count it clockwise. The pace you stop at will be your Major key.


For flats, do the opposite with E, located at the bottom of the Circle. Count counter-clockwise from E based on how many flats are in your key signature.
The Circle of Fifths is designed for Major keys. A Minor key will use the same accidentals, except the tonic note will be three steps down from the Major.The Circle of Fifths tells you the number of sharps or flats, but not where they are. Use this mnemonic to remember them:Sharps: Father Charles Goes Down And Ends Battle.
Flats use the same phrase backward, since Charles gets ""flattened"" in battle: Battle Ends And Down Goes Charles Father.
For example, since D major has two sharps, you read the first two words: Father Charles → the two sharps are F♯ and C♯.


, Many composers will end with a tonic note to give their work a sense of completion. Cross-reference the final note with the given sharps and flats and see if the accidentals line up with the note in question.


If the final note is a chord, look for the ""root note"", or lowest in the chord.
This technique may not work if the music you're trying to decipher is experimental or avant-garde.

, Although a chord map and list of accidentals should give you all the answers you need, it nonetheless helps to play out the song. If there was any doubt whether a piece if Major or Minor, those confusions should be laid to rest when you hear the music aloud.


Major keys are so-called because they sound ""happy"". Minor keys sound naturally sad in contrast.

Listen to the mood of the music.The applied effect of major and minor keys is the tone of a piece.,
Hum to find a root note.You can find a key by humming around for the root note.,
Play out the root note on an instrument.,
Train your ear.",How to Work Out Which Key You're In2," Generally speaking, major keys sound happy, while minor keys are melancholic or sad. Listen to the music and keep your ear out for the emotions at work in the piece. In the majority of cases, it should be easy to hear whether a piece is major or minor. Once you have that basis down, you'll have an easier time of specifying the key to a root note.


Major keys are typically purer than minor. If there is a mixture of happy and sad-sounding chords in a piece, chances are high it is a minor key.

, Unless the piece of music you're working with is incredibly complex, there should be a tone you can hum that matches all of the chords in a song. If you find this, hold onto the note. Record it on a voice recorder if you need to.


The Beatles' classic ""Yesterday"" is an interesting example due to its sophisticated chord progression. Play around by humming a few different notes, and try to hum the note as long as possible. If you find yourself stumped, hum the F note. Although certain notes may fit better than others, Yesterday is in the key of F Major.You may have to try out a few different notes before you hear one that sounds synchronous with the music.

, If you have an instrument, you can take the note you hummed out and apply it to an instrument. If you have a grasp of what the hummed root note was, you shouldn't have any trouble finding it on the instrument. Once you play a note on the instrument that matches your humming, you'll have be able to clearly identify what note it is based on standard notation.


Play along to The Beatles' Yesterday using one note. If you play F, you'll find the note backs up the chords used in the song.
There are tuner apps online and on your phone that will tell you what note it is you're singing.

, Figuring out the key for a given piece of music becomes a lot easier if you can identify notes with your ear and develop perfect pitch. Depending on your musical knowledge, this may be very tricky, but it can be done over the course of time and patience.


One technique to help you learn is note replication. Using a tuner (you can use free online tuners as well), listen to a pitch and read up what note it is. Think up the musical note in your head, and try to replicate it with your voice. Once you've sung it, play the tuner note again and see how close you got to the true pitch. Do this for all of the notes."

Identify keys in popular songs.,
Practice with major and minor-keyed songs.,
Work out the keys by ear.,
Look up the notation for your exercise songs.,
Listen to song versions in reworked keys.",How to Work Out Which Key You're In3," Popular songs are a great place to start if you want to train your knowledge of keys. Popular standards (like classical pieces or songs by The Beatles) are great because their keys are easier to decipher than complex or obscure music. Notation for these songs are also easy to find online, and the key signatures are easy to look up when you want to see the answers.


Sites like Key Finder are specifically around for people to research the key signatures of famous songs., If you want to perfect your key identification, you should be working with songs in both the main key categories. Major and minor-keyed songs operate in different ways, and you'll have to key your ear out for different patterns between the two.


For major-keyed songs, The Beatles' Yesterday and the Village Peoples' YMCA are great exercises. Yesterday in particular is a good exercise because of how deceptively tricky it is.
For minor-keyed songs, try Nirvana's Smells like Teen Spirit and Michael Jackson's Beat It. Both of these songs have been researched extensively already, and it won't be difficult to find info on these pieces if you need it.

, Listen to each of the listed songs and try to hum out a note that works throughout the piece. Even if you know the key of the song beforehand, try humming a few different notes and be mindful of which ones sound better than others.


Song bridges make something of an exception. It's a common pop songwriting convention to bring a section of a song into a different key. This convention is used to refresh the song towards the end.

, Notation will give you a visual equivalent to the music. Even simple pop songs can be notated with theory. Some music notation will list the key for you at the top of the page as well. Even if the answer is spoiled for you, it's helpful to know the proper key and look for evidence in the notation that proves that answer.


Modern pop and rock songs don't tend to have sophisticated notation. You may only find chord progressions and basic melodic notation for pop songs. Even so, this information should give you enough information to deduce the proper key., For examples of the difference between a Major and Minor key, listen to some reworked versions of popular songs. Songs like The Village People's YMCA are completely different when brought into a Minor key."

Find a theme to your song.,

Come up with a melody.,
Write lyrics.,
Perfect and rewrite if necessary.,
Make sure you have a safe quiet place to be in and relax before you start.Stretch or do some yoga, then drink some water and relax.",How to Get Good Song Ideas," First off, you need to figure out what you want your song to represent. Will it be a song about love and romance? heartache and pain? or maybe dragons and elves? During this process, it’s best to identify how you are feeling and what your mood is. What’s currently inspiring you? Maybe you’re feeling completely mundane, and you feel as though there’s no inspiration in your life. In this instance, it may be a good idea to draw from other sources. Here are some you might want to try:


Conversations: Maybe you’ve had a really good conversation with someone recently. Try to think of some of the key points of that talk, and translate it into lyrics.
Movies: Think back to one of your favorite movies. What emotions did that film spark? You can either write a song about the movie, or simply gather certain ideas from it.
Novels and/or poems: What’s the latest book you’ve read? If you haven’t read anything lately, try picking up a book and gathering ideas from that. Poems are another good alternative to draw from.;
, This is an important step and sometimes a hard decision to make. Do you naturally come up with words or melodies faster? This should help in determining which one you choose. If you find that you’re inclined to hum out a melody much quicker than you do writing lyrics, then it’s probably best to pick up your guitar or sit down at your piano first. If you’re one who can really jot down lyrical ideas fast once the can of worms has been cracked, then find somewhere quiet to sit down and start writing. The following two steps are interchangeable depending on which one you have decided to tackle first.

, Coming up with great melody is a tricky concept. Generally, the simpler the melody is, the more effective it will be. Here in lies the tricky part however, coming up with that perfectly simplistic melody, without seeming amateur or “cheap”. Don’t be frightened by this though, remember, stay genuine and good things will happen. Be patient and really take the time to come up with your best work.


Start by playing simple chords on your instrument. Keep in mind what kind of theme you have decided for your song. If it’s dark or sad, you might want to stick to minor chords. If it’s happy and up-tempo you might be better of with major chords. For electronic music, it is best to make sure you have a basic synth, then play around with it until you find something good.
Start humming or whistling different melodies over the chords.
Invest in a Dictaphone or micro-recorder, you never know when that perfect melody may come along and it’s best to document it while it’s fresh in your mind.
If you play guitar and like to play open chords, invest in a capo. This will assist you in trying new keys to play in.
Challenge yourself by learning new scales and chords. This will add depth and ultimately make your music richer.

, In most cases, lyrics are going to create the initial impression that your audience responds to, so it’s best to make every word count. Timing and delivery of your words are key. Try to think of different rhyming schemes and ways of conveying your message.


If you get stuck, try using tools such as rhyming dictionaries or a thesaurus.
Make sure you are using words in the right context. Use a dictionary if you are unsure.

, It’s important to make sure your song is the best it absolutely can be. There’s not much point in spending a lot of time on a tune that you’re not completely satisfied with. There is a fine line however, in knowing when your song is complete. Some artists may go too far in rewriting their songs, that they end up losing the initial essence that made the song good in the first place. Try not to get stuck in that sort of trap. Remember, you will always be your own worst critic, so don’t go too far down the rabbit hole, or you may never come back.


Continually challenge yourself, asking, “is this absolutely the best I can come up with for this section?”

, Make sure you have a notebook or computer to write your lyrics. After you do that, the words should come to you


Don’t be afraid to experiment. Try thinking outside the box, but not too far as to where no one else will be able to identify with your music (unless that is what you want of course)
Play the song for a friend or family member who isn’t afraid to give you honest feedback.

Test Yourself.",How to Use a Metronome," There are pocket-sized digital metronomes, wind-up mechanical metronomes, app metronomes for your phone, or you can even go all out and get a drum machine. Depending on your needs, some styles of metronome will perform better than others. In general, mechanical metronomes tend to have more basic features and work very well for a lot of the classical instruments that you'd find in an orchestra. Digital metronomes tend to have a lot of features designed with modern music performer in mind.;
, Consider the instrument you play. There are a wide selection of metronomes on the market for good reason. Depending on the instrument you play and your personal preferences you might find only certain metronomes for you. For instance, if you are a drummer you may need a headphone jack, a line out, or volume control features.If you have a stringed instrument that needs to be tuned, you might want to opt for a metronome with a tuner.
If you will need to use your metronome on the go, opt for smaller digital metronomes over larger wind-up mechanical metronomes.
If find visual cues help you to anticipate the beat and keep time better, either a mechanical metronome. By watching the swinging pendulum while you play it can help a musician to see the beat. Some electronic ones also have the option of a flashing diode or LED so you can either see the beat, or hear it.
Be sure the metronome you choose has a wide enough selection of BPMs to suit your needs.

, When you practice you will hear your metronome a lot, sometimes more than 100 times a minute depending on the speed of the song. It is important to try a metronome to be sure it makes a sound you can work with.Some digital metronomes make a high-pitched digital beep, while many make a tock noise similar to a very loud clock. Try playing along with the metronome and make sure the sound will help you to keep time without getting on your nerves or distracting you from your performance.

, Most digital metronomes will use BPM or beats per minute as a way to measure the speed of the piece. Some mobile metronomes available for phones will even allow you to tap the beat on your screen to get the corresponding tempo.


On most quartz metronomes, the BPM is listed around the edge of the dial. Within the BPM selections, there are corresponding Italian words that are traditionally used to describe tempo, such as Allegro and Presto.On wind-up models, you simply slide the weight up the metal bar to the desired tempo or the marking indicated on the music to be rehearsed.

, Many digital metronomes will allow you to set the time signature, but most wind-up metronomes do not. Time signatures consist of two numbers written how you would write a mathematical fraction. The top number indicates the number of beats in a measure. The bottom number indicates the value of the beat.


For example, a piece in 4/4 time would have four quarter notes in a measure, while a piece in 2/4 time would have two quarter notes in a measure.
Some pieces of music may have several time signatures. To practice them with a metronome you will have to take it in parts and reset the metronome to match the changing time signatures.

, Setting the volume for the metronome is especially important for any digital devices. You want to find a volume that won't be drowned out by the music but isn't overwhelming either. Many swinging or wind-up metronomes will not have a volume control, but musicians can follow the swinging of the metronome to keep accurate time even if they are unable to hear the metronome over the music. Some electronic metronomes will also have an LED light that goes on and off in time with the beat.

, Practice the piece without any regard to time at first.Once you know the notes and chords and have a good grasp on the order they are played, then you can begin to focus on performing the piece at the appropriate rhythm.

, Slow practice will make for fast playing. Set your metronome to 60 or 80 BPM to begin with.


Listen to the metronome for a few moments before you begin playing. You may want to tap your feet or watch the metronome to help you keep the time with your internal clock.

, Music is never equally difficult throughout the entire piece. Some spots will give you more trouble than others. Use the metronome at a slow speed and take it one note at a time until your hands become more familiar with required movements.


You can also try adding in the notes one at a time to work out a trouble spot. Begin with just the first note of the piece. Play the note again, then add the second note. Stop. Start again with the first two notes and add the third note, and so on. Continue until you reach the end of the piece.

, Once you feel comfortable and confident playing the piece slowly, increase the tempo. Small increases are the best. Stick to about 5 BPM above the previous setting. Go through the piece until you are comfortable with performing at the higher speed. Then, increase the speed again. Keep raising the tempo slowly until you can perform the song at full speed.

, Once you feel you have mastered a piece of music, you can try practicing the piece along with the metronome.You may not areas where your performance was not as even as you believed it to be. Work on those areas some more to become a better musician.

Base your songs around just one image, thought, or thing.,
Dive deeply into person angst or worries, from relationships to school.,
Tap into the classic punk tradition of anti-establishment, political songwriting.,
Don't be afraid to throw in a sense of humor.,
Know that there is no limit to your songwriting talents and topics.",How to Write Pop Punk Lyrics1," The most common topics in pop punk are love, adolescence, and youthful rebellion, but the beauty of the genre is how open it is. You can talk about politics, people, science fiction, or a night at the bar with your friends. The important thing is to keep it contained to one idea instead of cramming in 2-3. Pop punk songs are short, and you'll be much more effective focusing on just one idea for each song.


In general, pop punk songs have 2-3 choruses, 2-3 verses, and maybe one breakdown, usually without lyrics. You can also consider a chant or call and response section for audience participation, but that's about as complex as most pop punk song structures get.;
, Pop punk is generally a very personal medium. Your fears, stress, and anger all make great, raw emotions for a pop song, so don't shy away from your personal life and opinions. Punk is an open, DIY genre, and you should add your own take to your songs. While traditional ""punk"" steers free of emotional songwriting, pop-punk bands like Screeching Weasel, Good Charlotte, and more have proven that there is a demand for emotionally honest songwriting.


Love and heartbreak
Suburban angst
Rebellion against school, parents, etc.
Growing up., Green Day's album American Idiot, perhaps the most famous pop-punk political statement, is really just one album in a long tradition of socially conscious, politically informed punk rock music. Typically, the mood is rebellious and angry -- pointing out problems others won't in an attempt to bring about awareness about the issues you care about. Bands like ""The Clash,"" ""Bad Religion,"" and ""Anti-Flag"" can be powerful mentors. Some angles include:


Attacking a powerful political figure, like in Anti-Flag's ""Turncoat.""
Exposing an issue or ignored topic, like The Clash's ""Spanish Bombs"" or ""Washington Bullets.""
Mocking satire, pretending to be a political opponent to show how terrible their views are (""Kill the Poor."")

, Throughout the history of Pop-punk, pranksters, jokers, and biting satirists have shown that pop-punk can be just as funny as it is powerful, personal, or political. From NOFX's ""She's Nubs,"" most of Blink 182's early library, or the self-aware The Steinways, don't be afraid to write a silly, juvenile song just to get a quick laugh., The Lillingtons, for example, wrote most of their songs in an imaginary sci-fi universe, building up stories and ideas through futuristic lyrics. If you feel like writing a cowboy anthem in the vein of Social Distortion, go for it. There is nothing stopping you from crafting a pop-punk jam from Batman's perspective, or the mind of a monkey. Pop punk is a wide-open and inclusive genre, so write what you want to write.

"
"
Draft out the ideas or lines you want in your song.,
Begin with a simple, catchy chorus, as it's an essential part of most pop punk.,
Keep your verses short, using the same length and rhyming for each one.,
Think about adding a sing-along section or chant to a few songs.,
Read and cover other pop-punk songs to learn from the greatest.",How to Write Pop Punk Lyrics2," Sometimes the lyrics just start flowing, but more often than not writer's block sets in. Power through it by sketching out the ideas, thoughts, or essential images you want in the songs. If you think of a line or rhyme, jot it down even if you don't know how to use it yet. Once you have your key images and words, you can start building lines around them.


Even one good line can be the basis of a song, used as a chorus or a refrain to hold the song together.
Don't think of writing the whole song in one linear sitting. Just start writing parts and fragments, and slowly you'll start to see those that fit well together., Pop songs, no matter the genre, need to hook the listener and get stuck in the brain. It should be easily remembered, a short, simply phrase with a hummable melody. Think of this as the 1-2 sentences that sum up your entire song theme.


Once you've written the lyrics, try humming or whistling out tunes to find a good melody. When it is catchy even without words, you've got a killer chorus to use.
Green Day, Rancid, Operation Ivy, and Blink-182 are great bands who shot to popularity because they can write killer hooks, not just driving lyrics., More likely than not you'll write in couplets -- where each set of two lines rhymes with each other (""I can see into your soul / because you're just a victim of mind control"").You can also rhyme every line with each other, or rhyme ever-other line together (""hey"" / ""me"" / ""day"" / ""we"") for a more melodic, sing-song feel. If you're stuck fleshing out the lyrics:


Tell a tale or story (""Timebomb"")
String together related moments or images on the same theme (""Story of my Life."").
Approach the topic from new places or perspectives each verse (""Longview"")

, The sing-alongs, which are usually ""lalalas"" ""oooohhhs"" and ""ahhhhhhs,"" are a staple of pop-punk because it gets the audience involved. Frequently, the best place for a sing-along is the chorus or the outro, but you can place them everywhere. You don't need one in every song as it can get old. However, even a ""lyric"" as simple as ""nananana nanananana"" in ""All the Small Things"" can be the difference between a dud and a hit.

, When people commonly talk about how the Beatles or Bob Dylan were the best songwriters of their generation, they usually point to their years playing 100's of different rock or folk cover songs. You can do the same thing with pop punk. Covering songs helps you feel out things that work, learning from the very best as you subconsciously internalize song structure, lyric tricks, and catchy melody lines.


Cover the songs you like to play more like the bands you admire.
Reading lyrics without the music is a good way to see how lyrics are written, and a good way to compare you own.

Know your instrument's transposition.,
Know the key to transposition.,
Start with the key signature.,
Here's a helpful tool.",How to Transpose Music From C to B Flat," The following are some B-flat instruments:


Trumpet and cornet
Tenor sax
Clarinet;
, When a piano player reads a C on the score, the note that we hear is a C. Yet when a trumpet player plays a C on the score, the note that we hear is a Bb. To make music sound right (and to reduce tension in the band) we need to write parts for the transposing instrument so that the trumpet player and the keyboard player are playing in the same apparent key.

, A Bb instrument sounds one whole tone lower than what is written, you must raise every note written for that instrument by one whole tone. The easiest way to do that is to start by writing in the correct key signature for that instrument.


Let's say the piano part is written in the key of Bb (which should have 2 flats in the key signature, and does not in the picture), concert pitch. One whole tone up from Bb is C (the concert pitch diagram starts on D it should start on Bb), so you will write your trumpet part in the key of C.
Conversely, if the piano part were written in the key of C, you would start with a different key signature: D.

, To transpose a part for a Bb instrument, start from the concert key—the key that is actually being heard—and add a whole step to it. That is the key you will use for your transposing part.


For example, let's say the concert key is the key of G major. On the chart, find the key of G major (it's the second from the top left). Note that is written with one sharp, F#. One whole tone up from G is A, so find A major on the chart, and you will see it has 3 sharps: F#, C#, and G#. This is the key you will use for your Bb instrument.
Sometimes you shift from flats to sharps, or vice versa. For example, if concert key is F major, with a Bb, one whole tone up from F is G, which is written written with one sharp, F#.
Remember to not just change the key signature, but write the notes one whole tone up as well. For example, if the note on the concert score is ""F,"" the transposed note is ""G"".

Think about your guitar as an extension of your voice, mimicking singers.,
Think about silences as powerful musical tools.,
Use repeated themes and notes to give your solo structure.,
Use bends, slides, and vibrato for more expressive and personalized playing.,
Think of the entire solo, not just the notes you are currently playing.",How to Use Phrasing in Guitar Solos," When in conversation, few people simply talk in a stream of similar words. They use pauses, their voices go up and down, and use other bits of phrasing to make the words unique. Singers, who must stop to catch their breath, are particularly adept at phrasing. Note when they use silence and vary tempo to give just a few words or lines great meaning.









The big jazz singers -- like Cab Calloway, Etta James, Billie Holiday, and more -- have some of the best phrasing in music, no matter what the instrument.;
, Every guitarist dreams of playing more notes, and faster, than any other player out there, but the best guitarists know this is a fool's errand. From Jimmy Page's shredding on ""Heartbreaker"" to the soulful, slow playing of Muddy Waters, well-placed silences are essential to well-phrased solos. A silence builds suspense, letting the audience catch its breath so they can fully appreciate the barrage of notes coming afterwards.









Silences can be used to build a solo from calm and collected to face-melting power.
Thinking of your solo like a conversation, with pauses and waiting, is a good way to get used to this.

, This can lead to parallel phrasing, where you use similar licks in different parts of the solo, but change them slightly to keep things interesting. Thinking again of your solo as a conversation, this is like the ""thesis."" The theme is the 4-5 note riff that you keep coming back to, adjust, modulating, and playing with to make a coherent, well-composed solo.








, Throw in hammer-ons and pull-offs, use the whammy bar, or put a slide on your finger. Using different types of notes and tones will vary your phrasing considerably, like opening up a whole new vocabulary of notes. Good phrasing uses these unique accent notes to punctuate licks or pierce through temporary silence.









A big bend or well-held vibrato is a great way to create space in a solo without using silence.

, This is difficult but essential for burgeoning guitarists. How can your whole solo sound great, not just the individual bits? The answer is through phrasing -- building tension and excitement through variation. You could start with lots of silence and build to big notes. You might begin in single notes, then start adding triads and chords to the solo. You might even start loud, then lower the volume before bringing it back up. Whatever your plan, having this sort of structure is the difference between random noodling and killer phrasing.

Identify the key of your song.,
Locate key changes throughout the song.,
Choose a complementary key.,
Play the notes of your solo in the complementary key.,
Practice soloing frequently.",How to Solo over Chord Progressions1," The most common way of checking the key signature of the song you are in is by observing the notation in the clef at the beginning of your music. This will either have a number of sharps (#), flats (♭), or nothing at all. This will help you identify the key.


When there are no flats or sharps in the starting clef of your song, your song is in C major. The relative minor of C major is A.
Major keys: G (one sharp), D (two sharps), A (three), E (four), B (five), F# (six), C# (seven), C♭ (seven flats), G♭ (six flats), D♭ (five), A♭ (four), E♭ (three), B♭ (two), F♭ (one).
Minor keys: E (one sharp), B (two sharps), F# (three), C# (four), G# (five), D# (six), E♭ (six flats), B♭ (five flats), F (four), C (three), G (two), D (one).;
, Some songs change key at various points throughout the song. You'll need to account for these key changes while soloing by key.Scan each line of your music and look for:


A double bar line. This could be located toward the beginning, middle, or end of any line of music in your song.
Natural signs (♮). These are like an eraser that deletes the sharps or flats in your key previously. Each natural sign removes one sharp or flat.
New accidentals. ""Accidental"" is the term used to describe any key change (#, ♭, ♮).These will indicate your new key., Playing your solo in the same key as your song is the simplest way of ensuring you rock your solo in a complementary key. However, you could also play in keys that are harmonic to the key of your song.Keys sharing the same number of sharps or flats, or keys different by only a single sharp or flat on the Circle of Fifths, generally share many tones, creating harmony.

, There are many different ways you can execute this. You can play the key in scales, you can break up chords and solo those notes, or you could even transition between the notes of harmonic keys, like the ones surrounding the key you're playing in on the Circle of Fifths.If you hit a note that's dissonant, don't panic. Hold the note for a moment, and then scale up or down with whole or half steps until the dissonance resolves. This way, your dissonant note will seem intentional.

, Soloing is a difficult skill that is often complicated by other factors, like nerves. The more you practice, the easier it will be for you to fall into the motions you've practiced time and again.There are many places you might play with your band to gain experience, including:


Community talent shows
Local venues

Voice lead into the root of your next chord.",How to Solo over Chord Progressions2," You'll be able to come up with more interesting and varied notes for your solo if you base your solo off chords. Chords change much more frequently throughout a song than keys, meaning your chord based solo will likely have a greater variety of notes than a key based one.You may want to go through your song and write the chords for each bar of music if this information isn't already there.

, Now that your chords are written out, you can play scales or arpeggios in the key of those chords to create a complementary sounding solo. When the chord changes, change the scale or arpeggio you are playing to match the key of the new chord.Keys with the same number accidentals or keys different by only a single accidental on the Circle of Fifths are generally harmonious., You can think of the root of a chord as its most central tone. By playing the root of the chord throughout your solo, weaving it into scales, arpeggios, and more, your solo will sound more tonally centered and harmonic.The letter name of each chord generally indicates its root. For example, a Gmaj7 chord has a root of G, an F#min chord has the root of F#., Voice leading is a common soloing technique. It involves playing a note (or notes) either a half or whole step away from the root of the next chord, before that next chord is played.


The notes surrounding the root of your next chord will resolve to that root. When you play the next chord, this technique creates a natural kind of transition between chords."

The relative minor pentatonic scale of each chord will only contain notes already in the chord. This means its notes will sound pleasing in your solo.
You may want to leave some space between chords when you write them out. This way you can write the relative minor pentatonic beside the root chord.
A pentatonic scale is a scale is limited to five notes, with each note of the scale usually being a strong harmonic complement to the chord off which it's based., The general rule when soloing with a pentatonic scale is to use the relative minor pentatonic scale, which will nearly always sound good with the original chord. The relative minor of any major scale is three half-tones below the root note.


On a guitar, three half-steps will be represented by three frets on the neck of your guitar, with each fret standing for a half step.For example, if the root of a major chord is C, the relative minor would be A. For an F major chord, D would be its relative minor., Traditional western scales have eight notes, but your pentatonic scale(s) will only have five. To transform your relative minor scale into a relative minor pentatonic, you should remove the second and sixth tones from your relative minor scale.For example:


The relative minor of C major is A. To form a pentatonic scale in A minor, remove the second and sixth intervals from the root. This yields a pentatonic scale of: A, C, D, E, G.
The relative minor of F major is D. D minor's pentatonic scale, therefore, would be: D, F, G, A, C.
If you want to create a pentatonic from a major scale, you can do this by removing the fourth and seventh tone from the scale., Using the notes you've identified for the relative pentatonic minor scales of your chords, play your solo. Since the relative minor pentatonic scales only use notes already part of the original chords, the solo notes you play will complement the chords."

Enjoy playing your transposed music!

",How to Transpose Music from C to E Flat1," To transpose from C to Eb, you're transposing the music up a Major 6th, or down a minor 3rd. You will have to adjust the key signature (add three sharps), notes, and accidentals accordingly.;
, Again, you'll be transposing down a minor third, which you can probably figure out mentally if you've done this before, but for handy reference, you can refer to the chart below. To use it, you'll first have to identify the major key of the piece in C that you are transposing.
, If you can figure it out on your own from here, great, or you may have used a program that automatically changes the notes with the key signature. However, if you're doing this by hand, here's another handy reference chart.
, If you're transposing for a very high-sounding Eb instrument, and all the notes you ended up with are below the staff, move them up into the playable range for the target instrument.

, While writing by hand is an okay method, there are many computer programs that can make this easier, such as FinaleNotepad.

"
Put the C music on the bass clef, making sure to correctly write in the notes.

,
Switch the bass clef sign to the treble clef sign without moving the notes from where they were.,
Add 3 sharps to the key signature.",How to Transpose Music from C to E Flat2,", That means that the dots stay on the same line but mean different notes.

, When doing this a sharp cancels out a flat. For example, if the starting key signature had four flats, adding three sharps would make the new key signature have one flat.

",How to Rehearse Music2," Set a time when you will rehearse each day. Try to get a routine.


Alternatively you can split your rehearsal time. Whatever task you're doing, you can only do it efficiently for about an hour. Rehearse for a short period and move on with your previous task. Use this method several times a day.

,, Just rehearse the first four bars. Then rehearse from the third bar to the sixth bar. If you've rehearse two lines that way, try to play those two lines non-stop. Move on until you've finished the whole piece. Now play the whole piece non-stop.

, Play the score only as fast as you can play it without making any mistakes. This may sound hard at the first time, but you need even more time to correct the mistakes you make over and over again. If you recognize that you're making a mistake, repeat the passage two times in a slower tempo.

, Until now you've learned that you have to repeat very often parts of your music piece in a slowly way when you rehearse. That sounds boring. But boredom is negative when you want to learn something. That's why you should change the way you play after the second repetition. You can try to accelerate the tempo, exaggerate the dynamics, focus on the articulation and much more.

, Put your instrument away. Imagine to play the piece. Try to visualize it as definitely as you can. You should use this technique early - for example when you have to repeat a passage. This method seems strange at the first time, but the results will teach you a different lesson.

Understand concert pitch.,
Understand the relationship between C and F. C is a perfect fifth, or 7 semitones, higher than F. To help you visualize what that means, look at a music staff and count the lines and spaces from C down to F. You will see the following notes: C, B, A, G, F. There are five whole tones comprising the jump between C and F.It may be helpful to look at a keyboard, or even a picture of a keyboard as you count whole and semi tones.,
Create a cheat sheet.,
Look for difficult pairings.,
Test your cheat sheet.,
Prepare practice materials.,
Try writing out your transposed notes.,
Play what you have written.,
Increase the complexity of the score.,
Remember to transpose accidentals properly.,
Move the piece up or down an octave.,
Practice transposing in your head.",How to Transpose Music from C to F," Some instruments, such as the piano and flute, are pitched in what is called concert pitch. When there is a C written in the music, the pitch they play is actually a C. However other instruments, such as the French horn, are keyed in F, meaning that if you play what looks like a C for a piece of piano music, the sound will actually be an F.


In order for both a flute and a French horn to play a note that sounds the same, music for French horn, or another F instrument, will need to be transposed into the key of F.Other instruments, such as the Basset horn, the Cor Anglais and the F Alto Saxophone and the Wagner Tuba are also keyed in F.;
,
Pictures of keyboards with the names of notes labeled can be found online to help you gain a visual of what you’re doing.

, Rather than figuring out what a perfect fifth would be again and again, write down the relationship between each note on a cheat sheet in two columns. Begin with the note C. If C is the bottom of the scale, and you want to transpose to F, then F should be the bottom of your transposed scale. C becomes F, because F is five whole tones below C.


Now go up a half step. C# becomes an F#, because you need to maintain the ratio of five whole tones or seven semi-tones.

, In C to F transposition, there will be two times in the scale when one note in the pairing has a sharp and its companion does not. On a piano, this will mean one white note and one black note will be played to make a fifth.


In the key of C, the note F will become an A# (Bb) when you transpose to the key of F.
In the key of C, the note F# will become a B natural when you transpose it to the key of F.

, Make sure that you have not made any mistakes by reading or playing both scales that you have written. Are there any notes left out or repeated?


If you are at least somewhat familiar with a piano, try playing your paired fifths.
The note ratio should sound the same for every pair you have made. If not, you've made a mistake!

, Initially in transposing it will be helpful to you to write out what you’re doing. Print or draw an empty staff of music for yourself to try drawing in notes. Find a simple piece of music keyed in C for you to practice transposing.


Using music designed for beginners, with few accidentals, will make it easier to get the basics.
Beginner piano or flute music featuring simple well-known tunes such as Twinkle Twinkle Little Star may be a good place to start.
Avoid using an advanced piano score, which will likely include chords that will make it harder to practice at first. Try something simple with only single notes instead.

, For example, in C the first line of Twinkle Twinkle Little Star will be CC GG AA G. When you transpose it, it should be FF CC DD C, because that notation is exactly five whole tones lower.


Use your cheat sheet to check your work.

, Use your instrument to run through your transposed music. Remember to play what you have actually written rather than simply playing by ear.


This step will help you to catch errors.
You will quickly realize a mistake if you accurately play what you have written and it does not sound like the original tune.

, Once you feel comfortable transposing very basic music, try to transpose something more complex.


A duet scored for two flutes will provide you with an opportunity to try transposing both a melody and a harmony line.
It may not be immediately apparent if you make a mistake, so invite a friend to play your transposed duet with you to test if it sounds correct.

, Once you feel confident in transposing you may assume you know at a glance what a transposed note should be. However, if the note is an accidental (has a # or b sign that puts it out of the usual C scale) you will need to make sure you transpose it correctly.


Accidentals are easy to overlook, but make a big difference in whether the piece sounds good or not.

, Once you have transposed your music you may still find the range to be off. For example, a soprano singer would find notes transposed to the F below middle C very low for her range, and more appropriate to a tenor. In that case she would move the entire piece up an octave, so it is still in F but in a higher range.

, With time you may be able to skip writing down your transposition, quickly calculating in your head what each note should be. When you become familiar with the principles of transposition, try to transpose simple music without making any notations.

Identify the staff and clef.,
Learn the notes.,
Learn which notes correspond with open strings.,
Match numbers to each of your fingers.,
Learn the fingerings for the strings.,
Move your hand up or down the violin’s neck when Roman numerals are noted on the music.,
Play two stacked notes as double stops.",How to Read Music for the Violin1," The staff is the set of 5 parallel lines on the page where notes are marked. The clef is the very first marking on the staff, at the left-hand side of the first staff line.This signifies the musical register in which you play.


Violins only play in treble clef. This is the marking that resembles an &.;
, Each note is a round circle on a line or in a space on the staff. The notes in the spaces, from bottom to top, are F, A, C and E. The notes on the lines, from bottom to top, are E, G, B, D, and F.Notes below or above the staff are marked with a round circle and a horizontal line going through the middle of the note.
If there are flats (b) or sharps (#), these may be marked next to a note. They may also be marked next to the treble clef. For example, if a sharp is placed on the F line, this means that every F played in a given musical piece will be played as an F#.

, An open string means that it is not pressed with a finger when it’s played. There are four open string notes on a violin: G, D, A and E. These strings are in order from thickest to thinnest string, or left to right when holding the violin in playing position.On sheet music, these notes are often marked with a 0.

, In order to play more notes than just G, D, A and E, you will need to press strings with your fingers. The fingers on your left hand are numbered 1 to 4. Your index finger is 1, your middle finger is 2, your ring finger is 3 and your pinky finger is 4.


When a note is displayed on beginning violin sheet music, it will be accompanied by a number, 0 to 4. The 0 is an open note, while the other numbers correspond to a particular finger that will press a string., The notes on each string will ascend in tone as you place another finger down on the string.


Start by drawing your bow across the D string without pressing it down. This will play a D note.
Place your index finger on the D string and play. You are now playing the next note up on the D scale, or C#.
Play the next three notes on the D scale by placing your middle, then ring, then pinky fingers on the string.After you have placed your pinky finger on the D string and you have played that note, move to the next string (the A string) to play the next note in this scale. Start by playing the A string open (no finger pressing the string). Subsequent notes will be played by pressing first your index finger, then your middle finger, and so on.
While you practice pressing your fingers on the string in order, memorize the fingers that match the notes in the music. So, for example, when you see a D, you know that will be the open D string. When you see an F#, you’ll know to press your middle finger on the D string.

, When playing the violin, one of your hands will wrap around the neck in order to press the strings with your fingers. The strings can be played closer to the pegbox, usually called 1st position, or closer to the bridge (3rd, 4th or even 5th position). These positions are noted on violin music with Roman numerals underneath a note.Move your hand down the fingerboard of the violin to correspond with the numbered position. 1st position, or I, means that your hand will play closer to the pegbox of the violin neck.These positions may also be marked as “1st position” or “3rd position,” instead of using Roman numerals.
Most beginner violin music is written for 1st position., Double stops are when you play two notes together. On the violin, you’ll play two strings at the same time.Double stops are represented on the musical staff with two notes stacked on top of each other at the note position to which they correspond.


The notes may not be stacked directly on top of each other. Rather, there is likely a space between each, but one is above the other note.
Advanced violin music might have triple or even quadruple stops, meaning you play three or four notes together at the same time.

Play the bow in an upward direction for a V notation.,
Play the bow with a downward motion for a table-like notation.,
Play an angle bracket symbol by accenting the note.,
Play a bow lift notation.,
Look at initials to see which part of the bow to use.,
Decipher other bow notations.",How to Read Music for the Violin2," There are a number of symbols that indicate how to play with the violin’s bow. A V shaped marking under the note indicates bow movement in an upward direction., A shape that resembles a table (rectangle with two legs coming out of the bottom) is the notation for playing the bow in a downward motion.

, There may be an accent, depicted by an angle bracket symbol (>), above or below the note. This means that you should play the note strongly., A symbol shaped like a thickly drawn comma indicates a bow lift. When you see this symbol above a note, lift your bow and bring it back to the starting point., Sometimes, violin music will include initials, which directs the player on which part of the bow to use on a particular note or segment of music.The following are the typical initials used to determine which part of the bow to use:


WB: Whole bow
LH: Lower half of the bow
UH: Upper half of the bow
MB: Middle of the bow

, There are numerous other bow notations, particularly as you read more advanced violin music or music from an earlier era.These notations indicate advanced techniques to achieve certain sounds, such as:



Col legno: This means “with the wood.” Use the bow’s stick, rather than the hair, to play the strings. This can be damaging to the wood of the bow, so many musicians use alternate bows for these musical segments.

Sul ponticello: Position the bow at the bridge of the violin (at the body of the violin) to achieve a whispery tone.

Au talon: This refers to a section of music that should be played with the bow at the nut of the violin (the area between the fingerboard and the pegbox).

Martelé: This term means “hammered,” and indicates that you put pressure on the string with the bow and then draw the bow across the string with force. Release the bow pressure almost immediately from the string."

Play “Vibr” as vibrato.,
Play “pizz” as pizzicato.,
Play a Bartok pizzicato.,
Play a tremolo.,
Understand style markings.,
Pay attention to dynamics.",How to Read Music for the Violin3," Vibrato is an effect that warbles a note while you play. Vibrato is achieved by bending and unbending your finger as you play on a string.This dynamic is usually marked as “Vibr” underneath the notes that should be played as vibrato., Pizzicato is a technique, usually noted as ""pizz"" or sometimes spelled out in its entirety, that indicates you should play a note by plucking the violin string with your finger.


If there is no obvious “pizz” or “pizzicato” designated, then assume the musical piece should be played as “arco,” or using the bow to play the notes., Pizzicato may also be designated with the Bartok pizzicato symbol, also known as a “snap pizzicato.” This symbol, a circle with a vertical line through the top, will appear above the note to be plucked. This type of pizzicato is given an extra snap by pinching the string with two fingers and snapping it back into the finger board., A tremolo is a style of playing very quick, rapid sounds as the bow draws back and forth across the string. The tremolo is noted with thick, short diagonal lines drawn through the note or the stem of the note.They can be either measured or unmeasured.


One diagonal line means 1/8 note tremolo (measured).
Two diagonal lines mean 1/16 note tremolo (measured).
Three diagonal lines mean an unmeasured tremolo.

, Style markings give you an indication of the mood with which to play music. These are typically noted in Italian.Some of the more common words you’ll see are:



Con: With

Poco a poco: Little by little

Meno mosso: Less movement

Dolce: Sweetly

Allegro: Quick and lively

, Dynamics in sheet music indicate how loud or quiet you should play. These are typically indicated below the staff and will change as you progress through the music. Written in Italian, these range from very quiet (pianissimo) to mezzo (medium) to fortissimo (very loud).Dynamics usually show up as lower-case letters, such as p (piano), mf (mezzo forte), ff (fortissimo) and so on.
Crescendos and diminuendos are also used, which indicate that your playing should get louder or quieter gradually. They are typically indicated by a long, thin carrot or accent mark.

Understand what tablature tells you.,
Mark the frets on your violin.,
Match each left-hand finger to the frets.,
Read the notes on the tab.,
Download violin tablatures to practice.",How to Read Music for the Violin4," Tablature, or “tab,” is a shorthand way of describing where and when to place a finger on a string to play a note. This format often does not tell you note duration, however. A tab has 4 lines, each representing one of the strings on the violin.The lines are designated, from the bottom to the top, as G, D, A, and E.

, A tab will tell you which finger to place where on a given note, and if you have the placements marked already, it will be easier to read a tab. These markings can be made with tape or a dab of paint or white-out directly on the fingerboard of the violin. Measure these placements from the nut, or the connector between the fingerboard and the pegbox and tuning pegs.1st fret: 1 and 7/16 inches from the nut

2nd fret: 2 and 21/32 inches from the nut

3rd fret: 3 and ¼ inches from the nut

4th fret: 4 and ¼ inches from the nut

, Each of your fingers (minus your thumb) on your left-hand will have a number that corresponds to a fret. The index finger is 1, middle finger is 2, ring finger is 3, and pinky finger is 4. A 0 denotes an open string (no finger pressing the string).

, Each note will be marked with a number on a particular string line in the tab. For example, if there is a 0 on the top line of the tab, this means you will play the E string as open (no finger pressing the string). If there is a 1 on the top line of the tab, you will press the first fret with your index finger on the E string. If there is a 3 on the third line up on the tab, you will press the third fret with your ring finger on the A string., There is a wide variety of songs written in tablature for the violin that are available online. Type “violin tablature music” into a search engine to locate songs of varying difficulty.

Venture into the art of solo handbells.",How to Play Handbells," They're most common in churches, but some schools have them, or you may even be able to find a large community choir. All programs are different, so if you live in an area with more than one choir nearby, look into your options. Some programs are more structured and serious while others are more for fun. Especially in churches, the members are often older, but it's not unusual to see a handbell choir with people of many ages, or even one for young people only. Find one that you think you will feel comfortable being a part of.


If there isn't an active choir in your area, you might want to find some other interested people and work to start one.

, You should know how to read music. Handbell music is written on a grand staff, much like piano music, meaning you should be able to read treble clef and at least some bass clef, depending on how many octaves of hand bells are in your choir. You will need to be able to internalize a beat, since you may or may not have a conductor. A basic knowledge of music theory (mainly chords) may also be helpful.

, A good way to think of a handbell choir is like a piano, where each person only controls a few keys. Most small church or school choirs only have two or three octaves of bells, and you will probably be given two bells to start off. The bells are to be kept in keyboard order (lowest to highest, when going left to right, and in chromatic order) as much as possible, and you will take your place between the people playing the closest bells to you. When hand bell music is played well, it can be very beautiful and unique-sounding, which is why it's so popular in churches. Handbells are also as much of a visual art as they are a musical art; you'll see why if you watch a choir perform. They all ring with the same technique.

, The bells vary in size based on their pitch; obviously, lower bells are larger and thus heavier, and vice versa. The handle should indicate the note (pitch as represented by a letter and octave number), and some brands make the handles of flat/sharp bells black and leave the others white, much like the coloring of a piano keyboard. Inside the bell is the clapper, which is the part that strikes the bell and causes it to produce sound. There is a rotating piece on the clapper that can be used to control volume. A solid edge hitting the bell produces the loudest sound, while rotating the clapper to a setting with a hole in it makes a softer sound.

, Some brands have a marking on them indicating which way you should be holding them; for instance, Malmark bells have a picture of a bell on the handle on one side, which should be facing you.;
, When you reach the bottom of your circle, snap your wrist. This should produce a sound. Continue the circle until the bell comes to rest at your chest, where it started.

, Damping the bell causes it to stop vibrating immediately instead of letting the sound taper off and continue ringing for a while. If you are damping a very large bell, you may need to place your hand on it as well. Alternatively, bells of all sizes can be damped on the table or any other soft surface.


Sometimes, creative ways of damping bells can be used to add to the visual appeal of a handbell choir's performance.

, You should be able to ring well with both hands, regardless of which is your dominant.

, When you're playing whole notes, take your time making a large, graceful circle with a dainty wrist snap. When you're playing eighth notes, the bell shouldn't move far from your body at all.

, You only control two or three of the notes in the whole ""keyboard"" right now. You must work to play together with the other members of your choir to sound like one instrument.

, If you're playing F4 and G4, marking all of your notes with a highlighter or pencil before you start playing should make it easier to keep track of where you're playing. In time, you may grow out of needing to do this.

, If you have a conductor to watch, that's great, but not all choirs do. Learn to count in your head or subtly tap your foot so that you know when to play.

, Playing handbells is a musical experience different from playing any other instrument that many people do not ever get to have. Enjoy what you're doing, or it's not worth doing in the first place.

, Handbell music has its own special markings and directions that you will never see on other music. For instance, instead of trilling, handbells ""shake"" (usually indicated by the letters Sk on the music). This is exactly what it sounds like; instead of just playing the note, letting it ring, and damping it, you shake the bell for the notated length of time. There are also markings that tell you to damp in certain ways; for instance, damping on the table, or purposely bringing the bell to the table with force as to create a certain sound.

, This technique makes it much easier to play more than two bells at once. To do this, put two bells together through their handles in a way that they are all facing a different direction. You will want two or three bells in each hand. You will discover that you can move your arm one way to play one of the notes in that hand and a different way to play the other one. Obviously, this is easier with smaller bells.

, Sometimes this is written into the music, and other times it is a decision made by the director. To pluck, lay the bells down on the table as you normally would, and lift up the clappers and gently drop them, instead of ringing.

, To do this, lay the bells down on (in keyboard order, of course), and gently tap them with mallets instead of playing.


Be aware that you do need to use special mallets intended for handbells. Smaller ones are for smaller bells, and larger ones are for larger bells. Often, the range of bells a particular size of mallet is used for will be marked somewhere on the handle.

, There are many different ways to do this. Some soloists set up a table with an octave or two of handbells and play all of them, usually with some kind of accompaniment. Others play simple melodies four- or six-in-hand. It's all up to you.

First things first, this article is written assuming that you already know how to play the guitar.,
Buy a Guitar.,
You will also need an amp and a cable (except if you're serious, you want a transmitter and bookbag!),

Don't crank the distortion on your amp.,
Solo in Pentatonic and Hexatonic.,
Get the hair.,
Movement.",How to Rock Like Angus Young," If you don't, see some other articles about purchasing a guitar and then learn the chords: A, D, E, E5 (which is meaner than plain old E) and G. With these you can cover the main riffs of many of AC/DC's classics, such as ""Highway to Hell"", ""Back in Black"", and ""TNT"".;
, You don't need an expensive guitar to rock. But if you happen to be loaded, a Gibson SG '68 is the guitar that Angus Young plays. You can get these for around $1500-2500. If you can't afford an SG, try to find a guitar with Humbucking pickups: Single-coils won't get you his sound. Vintage style (""PAF"") Humbuckers are ideal, so that's what you should look for. An ultra-modern pickup like EMG would be inappropriate when trying to copy Young's tone. Use your bridge pickup for most rhythm and lead playing. For a bluesier tone, use both pickups and turn down the tone knob to about 6 on the neck pickup.

, to connect the guitar to the amp. Angus uses vintage Marshall tube amps like JTM45s and old 50w Master Volumes. In shows, he uses the 100w Marshall heads at 6 for the type of gain, but for solos, he uses the 50w heads on 10 for the gain, but lower power to match the volume.

, One of the most identifying features about Angus Young's style is the way he uses his pick. Use an extra heavy gauge pick. Hold the pick so that about the width of a pencil is showing on the bottom, and strike the strings fairly violently, but don't let them buzz.

, He has a really strong left hand, it takes some practice to nail it. Put emotion into it, not like Clapton but don't play it like metal. His solos are very bluesy. His vibrato is not a back and forth usually (B.B. king), more of an up and down.

, Angus leaves almost every knob on his amp set at 5, except when he occasionally turns the mids up to 6! His sound is surprisingly clean and dynamic. The sound has to be clear, but mean. If you are using a Fender amp, make sure you crank up the mids to make it sound more like a Marshall. A tube amp will have a more touch-sensitive feel and will cover the fine line between clean and dirty more easily than a solid-state amp ever will. A Peavey Classic 30 (or something similar) is a good way to go if you are short on cash. Angus doesn't use any distortion or boost pedals (even during solos) so avoid them if you want a truly authentic tone. Use a mild overdrive pedal (instead of distortion) if you must use one at all!

, He's a blues man!


Before you start your solo at the beginning of ""Thunderstruck"" (or any other solo), raise your pick into the air as high as you can reach. Show off your weapon, the key that unlocks the vault of all great rock.
During any guitar solo of Angus', you will notice him doing one of his signature dances. But his most popular by far is the one where he lifts his heels into the air, keeping his toes on the ground. (For all of you marching band people, this is just like marking time.) Start with either you left or right foot, but once you start, continue in this sequence: Left, Left, Right, Right, Left, Left, Right, Right...and so on. (This is going to be hard for marching band people, who have it drilled into their heads to go Left, Right, Left, Right...) Angus makes this dancing look easy but it is incredibly difficult to do so while playing guitar. The fact that he never misses a single note in live concerts while doing spectacular stage stunts is a testament to his immense skill.

, It is not necessary to grow your hair, but it adds to the whole, rock 'n' roll feel. But if you do, Be sure to swing your head around a lot and show off those gorgeous locks.

, Also you're going to obviously learn how to duck walk for those awesome solos and don't forget to head bang, two with head up, two with head down (keep repeating this pattern). Another thing is to look your audience in the eyes and pull some great rockin' out faces. If you complete this through a whole song, if you did it right, you should be dripping with sweat.

Set your microphone up with the null point (point of rejection) facing your monitors.,
Turn off one monitor (the one you didn't aim the mic at).

,
Place your singer in front of the microphone and do some sound tests.,
Now that you have found your levels, record the vocals.,
Without changing anything (monitor level, mic placement, same monitor turned off), stand in front of the mic yourself and record just the bleed-through of the track through the mic.,
With this done, you should have two tracks: One with your vocal take (with bleed-through) and another that contains the bleed-through by itself.

,
Invert the phase on the bleed-through track.,
Understand that with the phase now inverted, raise the level of the bleed-through track to match the decibel level of the vocal track.

,
Play both tracks back simultaneously.,
Do this with each song, making sure to keep records of you mic choice, mic position, and monitor level.

",How to Record Vocals Without Headphones," On most mics (ones with a cardioid or hyper cardioid polar pattern) you can find the highest rejection by aiming the end of the mic at one of the monitors and then turning it just slightly left or right.;
,, As you are doing these, it is important that you find : a.) A monitor level that is not too loud, but is comfortable for the singer. b.) The proper gain level so that the signal isn't distorting. c.) The mic position with the smallest amount of bleed-through. NOTE: There will be some bleed-through involved, just make sure it is as quiet as possible.

, With the vocal take recorded, open up another track and label it ""Bleed-Through"" or something to that nature.

, Remain totally silent during the recording, as you are just catching the bleed-through.

,, On Pro-Tools this can be done by opening the plug-in ""Trim"" on the insert of the bleed-through track and pressing the invert phase button. On Adobe Audition you can use an Audio Suite effect called ""Invert"" to flip the phase.

,, The inverted bleed-through track should cancel out a large amount of the bleed-through on the vocal track.

Research licensing companies online.,
Talk with other artists you know.,
Attend music conventions.",How to License Music1," You want to make sure that the company you are going to sign with is a legitimate, experienced company that is going to make money for you. You’ll want to look at things like:Their length of experience in the business
Their credit list - the artists they have worked with
The terms of the deal they are offering
Their professionalism and look of their web site;
, Word of mouth is a powerful tool in the music business. If you know other singers or songwriters who have already licensed their music, find out who they have worked with. Ask if they have been satisfied with their deals and with the money they have received. The way a company treats one artist is a sign of how they’re going to treat you., Get out and meet people in the business. Listen to what kind of music is getting played, and where it’s getting played. Try to determine where your music will fit in. Licensing may include TV commercials, TV and movie background music, theme songs. Even licensing for background elevator music brings in money and leads to exposure. Do the research to figure out where you are going to have the best chances to get your sound out there."
"
Decide if you want to license your music yourself or try to work with an agency.,
Network, Network, Network.,
Send out a professional sound.,
Send out your best stuff.,
Make it clear that you own your music rights.,
Negotiate the best deal, but be reasonable.",How to License Music2," Licensing by yourself means that you are going to do the legwork and the phone calling to get your music into the hands of music publishers. Doing this requires more work on your part, but you can retain a higher level of control. Joining an agency gives up a little of that control, but can benefit you with broader exposure. Talk with other musicians about their experiences to help make the decision. Licensing agencies are selective about who they take on, so the tips for licensing your own music or for getting accepted by an agency are pretty much the same.

, To license your music, you will need to reach out to music publishers, agents, and music supervisors. These are the people who make the decisions about what music gets purchased and what music gets played, on the radio, television, movies and online.The more contacts you make, the more chance you have that someone will hear what you have and give it a shot.Talk with other musicians for references.
Use the Internet to search out people online.
Subscribe to music journals and publications to keep up with the industry.

, It is important that your music be up to “industry standard” if you want to get serious consideration. This means that you can’t expect to just sing into your cell phone, upload it to YouTube, and be taken seriously. Music publishers and supervisors want to hear your best sound. If this means that you invest some money in a professional recording studio - or find a friend who has some professional equipment - it would probably be worth the investment.This doesn't necessarily mean that only professionally-recorded music will qualify - the process of ""mastering"" is often the most important step to your music sounding comparable to the industry, so regardless of how the music is produced, you may want to put extra emphasis or money into mastering.

, Most sources agree that if you want to catch a publisher’s attention, you need to let them hear your best sound right up front. Don’t send a CD full of everything you have ever recorded. They won’t listen to that. Send your very best one or two songs. If they’re interested in that, then they’ll ask for more., This will make the publishers more interested in working with you. A lot of publishers will be interested in licensing from new artists because they think they can move the deal more quickly, and probably cheaper.And if you’re trying to get started, this is probably true. So if you’re sending out samples of your music, include a note or letter that makes it clear that you own the full rights to the song. That should catch their attention., Once you get a music publisher’s attention and they’re interested in your music, you will need to negotiate a deal for their use of your music. There is a wide range of possibilities here. Someone could pay you a single fee for the right to use your song for a single purpose, such as a background track for a commercial. Someone could offer to pay you an ongoing royalty for repeated use. Or someone may like your lyrics but want to alter the overall sound of the song for some purpose you haven’t considered yet. None of these is necessarily the “right” way to go. You will have to make that decision. But it may be helpful to have an attorney or music agent help you review the terms of contract offers so that you completely understand what you are agreeing to."
"
Find a Performance Rights Organization (PRO) to Join.,
Join the PRO you have selected.,
Read the contract carefully.,
Manage your account.",How to License Music3," A PRO is a company that you join and become a member. Then that company works with you and your music, and collects the royalty fees from outside entities that want to use your music.If you are creating your own music, then you are a songwriter and/or composer; if you are performing it or writing it down, then you are a publisher. In either case, a PRO works with you to protect your rights to your music and see that you get the royalty payments you deserve when your music is played.Some of the leading PROs to consider are:ASCAP - American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers.
BMI - Broadcast Music, Inc.
SESAC - Society of European Songwriters Artists and Composers
You are only allowed to be a member of one PRO at a time. If you choose to switch in the future, that is possible, but it is best to make an informed decision up-front.
A PRO is not a licensing agency and will not get deals for you. However, joining a reputable PRO is generally considered the first step to be taken seriously. They monitor the airwaves that play your music and ensure that your royalties are paid.

, The companies make the application and joining process very simple. All you need, in most cases, is some general identifying information, along with your social security number, and, in some cases, a credit card to pay an application fee. You can apply online, or by downloading an application form, completing it, and returning it by mail., When you are joining or affiliating yourself with a PRO, part of the process includes signing a contract. While the contracts are generally a fairly standard part of the music industry, and you will likely see names and faces of artists you know and trust, you should always read the contract carefully yourself and understand it. If you do not fully understand what you are signing up for, you should consult with a lawyer before signing., The big PROs make it easy for you to manage your account. You will have secure login access, so that you will be able to see where your songs are being played and how your royalties are calculated."

Purchase a high quality handsaw.,
Bend your saw.,
Work the blade of the saw in the waving motion while you thumb.,
Work a twisting motion into the blade as you progress in your ability to modify the sounds created by the bending, strumming, and dampening process.,
Develop your own sound as you become skilled.,
Build a ""bow"".,
Play the saw with your bow.,
Use a ""striker"", or ""hammer"" to play your saw.",How to Play the Saw," Here, you won't have to worry about TPI (teeth per inch), just the length and the temper (metallurgical for hardness) of the blade, and the size of the handle. Old timers used quality saws in their craft, since there were no miter saws, etc. A Disston D23 is a good example, but even they don't seem to be the quality they once were.


It is not likely the manufacturer would admit it, but the metal in modern handsaws does not seem to work well with this technique. You may be better off shopping flea markets or yard sales for cast off, worn out saws of yesteryear. The condition of the teeth, or even missing teeth on an old saw should not affect its playability.;
, You do this by grasping the handle in the palm of one hand, the end of the blade in the palm of the other, and flexing it in a wave-like or undulating motion down the length of the blade. Once you mastered the wrist movement that this step requires, you should hear a tone from the vibration in the metal.


Practice making the ""wave"" in the metal of the saw blade travel from one end (usually the tip of the blade), to the other in a controlled, fluid motion.

, To thumb means to either rub or strum the metal blade near the handle with the thumb of the hand which is holding it. The pressure from your thumb, either simply pushing (which dampens the vibration), or ""strumming"" by drumming on the blade will change the tone, creating effects in the sound the saw makes.

, This can raise or lower the pitch of the basic tone of the metal when it is ""sprung"" in the waving motion between your hands.

, There is no exact ""recipe"" for producing perfect pitch or creating certain notes, even if there were, there is little you can do to ""tune"" this simple instrument, and no two are likely to be exactly the same.

, When you have learned the technique of creating sound from the metal of your saw, you may choose to build a bow, similar to a violin bow, to use the produce the full range of sounds your ""instrument"" is capable of.


Drill two small holes in a flexible wooden ""yardstick"", or other thin, flexible piece of wood.
Tie the of a length of Dacron or other fishing line or other strong, thin, thread through the hole at one end, then pull it tightly enough through the hole on the other end to bend the yardstick in a bow shape. Continue winding this line around the ends of the bow, until you have at least 30 or 40 wraps laid in. Your bow ""string"" should lay flat, and each line should be tight and lay in as closely to the others as possible. You may use hot melt glue or some other glue to fasten the strings permanently when you are finished wrapping them.
Wax or use rosin to coat your bow string.

, Lay the handle of the saw in your lap, while sitting up in a straight-backed chair, and grasp the tip with your left hand. Bow the saw blade as you did in the early steps to produce your desired pitch or tone. Draw the bow across the smooth side, or back, of the saw blade. Differences in the amount of tension you create in the metal, and the amount of bow in it, will produce different sounds, so experiment.

, This technique can be used by building a ""hammer"", similar to a drumstick. You may find a drumstick, or small diameter wooden dowel, and ""tap"" the sawblade with it to produce sound. A soft ""head"" can be made by either by wrapping the end of your stick with twine or even rubber bands to form small balls on it to use as a striker. Tapping the saw on different portions of the blade while changing the ""bow"" of the blade will produce different notes.

Choose a piece of bamboo.,
Hollow the bamboo.,
Make a pattern of dots on the bamboo.,
Drill the holes.,
Insert the skewers.,
Allow the glue to dry.,
Smooth the sides.,
Make end caps.,
Fill the rainstick with pebbles and other objects.,
Affix the other endcap to the rainstick.",How to Make a Rainstick1," You'll get the best sound if you choose a wide, long piece of dry bamboo. The longer and wider your wood, the richer the sound will be. You can cut and cure your own bamboo or buy a piece at a garden store. Get a smooth, straight piece without any bends or holes.;
, If your bamboo piece isn't already hollow, use a metal rod to push out the material at its center. Once the path is clear, attach a piece of sandpaper to the end of the rod. Use it to sand the inside of the bamboo so that it's smooth and free of obstructions.


If you don't have a metal rod, any sort of strong, long implement sturdy enough to scrape out the inside of the bamboo will work.

, Use a pencil to create a pattern of dots around the outside of the bamboo. These dots will be the places where you bore holes to insert the wooden skewers, which are an essential part of the rainstick. Making a pattern that spirals around the bamboo from the top to the bottom will look very attractive and ensure that the pebbles or rocks you place inside will have plenty of obstacles to plink against.

, Use a drill bit the same size as your wooden skewers, so they'll be able to slide right in. Carefully drill each hole you marked, taking care to puncture the bamboo without drilling through to the other side of the stick.


If you do not have a drill, you can still make a rainstick using long nails. Instead of drilling the holes, use a hammer to pound a long nail through each hole. Make sure the nail isn't long enough to penetrate the other side of the bamboo stick.

, Put a bit of glue on the tip of a skewer and thread it through one of the holes. Push it through until it runs up against the other side of the bamboo stick. Use a sturdy pair of scissors or a small handsaw to cut the skewer flush against the bamboo stick. Continue inserting skewers and cutting the ends until each hole has been filled.


This step isn't necessary if you used nails instead of skewers.

, Wait about an hour before finishing your rainstick.

, Sand off the nubs left from the skewers with a flat file or some sandpaper.

, To plug the ends of the rainstick, cut out two circular pieces of wood the same width as the ends of the stick. Glue the first end cap to the base of the stick using wood glue or superglue, to make sure it won't budge. Save the other cap for now.


If you don't have the supplies to cut out pieces of wood, you can make endcaps out of cardboard, particle board, or another sturdy item you have in your home. Just make sure you can glue the cap securely to the end of the stick.

, Different materials will make different sounds as they plink against the wooden skewers. Use pebbles of different sizes, pennies, dried rice, dried beans, beads, and any other items you like. Fill the rainstick about 1/8 - 1/4 with objects.


Don't overfill the rainstick, or you won't be able to hear the individual sounds of the objects.
Putting too few objects in the rainstick won't give you the impression of rain when you use your instrument.

, Use wood glue or superglue to seal the rainstick on the other side. Let it dry completely before using.

Choose a long, thin tube to use.,
Draw dots on the tube.,
Drill the dots with a drill bit that corresponds with the size of your skewers.,
Insert the skewers.,
Leave the rainstick to dry.,
Smooth the sides.,
Insert an endcap.,
Fill the tube with pebbles and other materials.,
Finish the rainstick.,
Decorate the rainstick.,
Admire its beauty and do a rain dance!
",How to Make a Rainstick2," Either PVC or cardboard works well. If you're using PVC, smooth the entire PVC pipe using a fine sanding sponge.

, These will mark the places where you'll create holes to build your rainstick. Start about two inches from the end of the tube and draw dots all the way up. These dots should be spaced apart evenly (one half inch up and one inch across) and arranged helically (spiraling).

, Drilling directly through the center of the pipe each time will produce a double-helix arrangement of holes.


If you don't have a drill, you can use long nails instead. Place a long nail at each dot and use a hammer to hammer them in. Make sure the nails aren't long enough to pierce the other side.

, Dab the end of a wooden skewer with Gorilla glue or another sturdy glue and insert it into a hole. Cut the end so that its flush with the outside of the tube. Continue inserting the wooden skewers in the holes and cutting them to an appropriate length.


This step isn't necessary if you used nails instead of skewers.
You can get super glue designed for PVC pipe. In the pictures, Gorilla PVC Cement is used.


, Wait about an hour before finishing your rainstick.

, Sand off the nubs left from the skewers with a flat file or some sandpaper.

, Cover one end of the tube with a plastic, PVC or cardboard cap, so that the pebbles and other materials don't fall out.

, Pour in pebbles, dried rice, dried beans, beads, and other materials of your choice. Place your hand over the open end of the tube and tilt it to test the sound. You can add or remove material to fine-tune the sound.

, After the desired sound is found, glue the other cap onto the end of the rainstick. Allow time for the glue to set.

, Use ModPodge (or an equivalent decoupage substance) to paint the rainstick evenly. Working with a small portion at a time, place decorative tissue paper over the glue, pressing it down against the tube. After covering the pipe with decorative paper, go over it with more coats of Mod Podge until it isn't papery to the touch. Let it dry completely.

Take some time to learn the software.,
Start your track with the drums.,
Decide your loop length.,

Add the transitional elements.,
Master your music.,
Post your track online.",How to Write a House Track," While hardware mixers and synths are often used by pros, software alternatives are considerably less expensive and an increasing number of professional producers use software. A digital audio workstation (DAW) will be used for much of the process, so finding a good one can be key. Some of the more popular DAWs include Ableton Live, Cubase, and FL Studio. In addition, you may want software (or hardware) synthesizers. Some popular soft synths include Massive and Sylenth1. Finally, sample packs can help since drums are often difficult to synthesize. You might try the packs from Vengeance, although there are plenty of free packs online.


If you can't afford synths, you may be able to find some free online. Many DAWs will come with soft synths too.
Listen to music using DAWs, vsts, or sample packs you're considering buying. If the software is popular, it shouldn't be too hard to find.
Be sure your computer is reasonably up to date, or it may not run your software. A good soundcard, as well as good headphones help too.;
, Make sure you understand the interface, not just of your DAW, but your vsts too. There are lots of tutorials are on youtube for more popular software, and the website for your software may have information too.


Don't be afraid to follow tutorials outside your genre. A little work in funk or dubstep will only help you understand your software all the better.

, You don't have to start with drums, but many producers may choose to start with them. Your bpm should be about 120-130 depending on subgenre, although some may by slightly outside these speeds. Take your kick drum and place it on every quarter note of a 1 bar loop. Then your snare should be on the offbeat (skip the 1st quarter, play the 2nd, etc.) An open hat should be between each quarter, and closed hats can play 16ths for speed.


While this forms a nice basic beat, you may want to add extra elements. Toms or random percussion effects would be more common, although it is your song. If you would prefer an unusual instrument, go for it!
You may want to create separate patterns for each instrument. That way you can build and remove elements throughout the song.

, In house, loops may often last 8 bars. Set your 1 bar drum loops to repeat for 8 bars. If you would rather not use 8, loops lasting 16 or maybe 32 bars are sometimes used. Shorter loops are used too, although they may sound overly repetitive.


These lengths are used to make transitioning songs easier on the DJ.

, Synth chords, vocals, and synth basses are some of the more common elements, although as long as the loops sound good together, anything goes. Don't worry about it sounding too intense too early in the song. This isn't actually how your song will begin, but if the loops played together blend well, the track will sound more cohesive.


Don't be afraid to blend real with electronic. If done well, it can add more depth to your tracks.

, Take the different patterns and work in units of 8 bars (more or less if you choose) to create your track. you might start with your synth pad, add the kick after the first 8, bring in the snare next, etc. You can remove elements too of course, or add more than 1 element at once.


Many house tracks start with a ""drum intro."" This is where you gradually introduce your drum patterns before playing the melodic (or harmonic) elements.
Units of 8 bars often group to form larger sections of 32. You might have a 32 bar drum intro, a 32 bar breakdown, then a 32 bar ""drop,"" etc.

, Filtering in your leads, or using a downlifter that came with one of your sample packs will work, but there are many different transitions. Try listening to some of your favorite tracks and see how they transition.


Wind effects are good for transitions and not nearly as difficult to synthesize as drums. You could try make some yourself instead of sampling. That way you have more control over the sound.

, It can be a complex process, but it will greatly improve your results. You can always find someone to master it for you, or learn yourself. Try to find guides online.

, Youtube or Soundcloud are great for posting music. Although, if you used any copyrighted material, be sure to give credit where due.


Even if you don't want to sell your music, download links from Mediafire or similar file storing sites can be nice. It'll be easier for your friends to get a hold of it.
If you do want to sell it, you may not need a label. Bandcamp, TuneCore, or CD Baby make self publishing very easy.

This will allow you to draw out the features of your tracks with greater accuracy.One of the most important parts of mixing a song is knowing what to highlight and what to downplay, and being able to hear these features will help.To improve your work space's acoustics:


Be aware of room modes, or how the shape your room can impact the frequencies of your sound. Room modes have been especially known to cause difficulty with low to low-mid frequency sounds playing on your system.
Limit bouncing sound waves. As soon as sound leaves your speakers, it will reflect off the hard surfaces in your room, which can influence the stereo and frequency of your sound.
Balance your speaker distance from hard surfaces, which can add low frequencies to your sound when too close.
Be symmetrical in your set-up. This will allow you to hear the distribution of the sound between speakers most clearly.;
, A DAW is a digital audio workstation, and unless you have a studio at your disposal, it's likely going to be how you mix your music. There are many different kinds of DAW, some free and others costing over $800.Which of these will work best for your situation is a matter of preference.You'll have to look into the features of each DAW, but some popular options are:


Ableton Live
Cubase
FL Studio 11
Pro Tools, The mixer of your audio interface should be as orderly as possible. This will allow you to tweak and adjust your sound without any confusion or error. To save yourself time and improve your efficiency, you should label your tracks according to a system that makes sense to you.For example, you might:


Write out the full name like, ""Snare Drum 7""
Label according to your own abbreviations, like ""SnD7.""

, By color coding your tracks according to basic categories, you'll know your tracks immediately just by looking. An example of this might use:


Purple for bass
Blue for drums
Red for vocals
Orange for Instruments

, When listening to a track over and over again, listening at lower volumes can protect your ears from unnecessary strain. Lower volume listening can also help you recognize subtle variations in instrument volume.


A general rule of thumb: if you cannot talk over the volume of your playback, you should turn your volume down., Turn off your phone and set an editing routine for yourself so that you can keep your focus trained on your goal of a well mixed song.

, The ""rough mix,"" which is your reference, will clue you in on how you should proceed with your audio engineering.You should listen to the rough mix to become familiar with the features of the song you will be mixing.


While mixing, ask yourself: ""What is the goal of the artist or producer who made the song?""
The rough mix is also where problems with the mix will be most apparent. Take note of these features; you'll need to smooth them later in the mixing process., Many producers and artists aim to accomplish a certain feeling or ""vibe"" through the expression of a mix. Listen to the rough mix repeatedly until you instinctively feel the direction of the music, its thrust, and how its component tracks work together.When listening, start with your faders at center volume and then adjust tracks to see how each interacts with each other and the mix as a whole.

, This is also a good point to determine the kind of atmosphere you are trying to create. An upbeat and punchy atmosphere will require a different approach from one that is distant and haunting.You may want to use an effect, like reverb, to create fullness in a melodic line.
For faster, more rhythmic songs, you may need to bring out the bass line during build sections.
Vocals should be clear and distinct from instrumental parts, unless used as a background chorus.
Background and accent vocals are often treated as part of the ensemble, not the main attraction or key feature. Your mixing should reflect this., These will need to be highlighted or polished later for greater effect. If you cannot see the purpose a particular track, that may be a sign that you don't need it at all.


Use your fader to subtract tracks to see the impact these have on the mix as a whole.
Isolate parts of your mix that sound unclear and find the root track(s) causing the distortion. Later, you will need to balance the offending track, or maybe remove it completely.

, By listening to similar songs you can hear how instruments are utilized to build a track. You may also get completely new ideas for effects that you could make use of in your own mix.Drawing inspiration from other songs can be a powerful tool for your mixing process.

, It may help for you to think of your song as a pyramid. The lowest, heaviest parts (bass drum, bass guitar, etc.) form the foundation of your mix. The middle segments are filled out with guitars, keyboard, and other percussion. Lastly, your vocals and lead parts create the top. While learning the ropes, your mixing process should generally follow this order.


Working from the bottom up can help create a more balanced sound and better defined EQ., Poor track quality might not seem like a big deal in the beginning, but when you start adding more tracks to your mix, it can have a multiplier effect. This can be devastating to the quality of your mix as a whole. But since you'll be listening to each track on its own while balancing volume, you'll have an ideal chance do a quality check.Replace low quality tracks when you are able to save yourself work later on, when you'll have to smooth out negative features.

, Use your audio interface to listen to each track individually, and then adjust the volume.


By keeping your sound levels low, you can allow yourself more room to fine-tune the mix to your liking.
A conservative sound level to start with is -10 dB on the master fader.Generally, you can protect yourself from clipping by keeping your tracks out of the top limit, expressed by the red zone on your master., When you group similar sounds together into a single track it's referred to as ""bussing.""This means that you can apply processes to all the tracks contained in your bus at the same time.


You'll have to experiment with your particular tracks to find which can be grouped together in a bus.

, Panning is the the movement of sound left and right through the stereo field of your mix. You should have a general idea of how you'll use panning so that when it comes to placing your instruments you can work quickly. Plan on organizing heavy and low frequency sounds, like your bass, toward the center of your stereo field., With EQs you can either strip or boost high or low frequencies, which can be particularly useful with drum kits. When drum kit sounds are recorded, the vibrations caused by its low frequencies can resonate with other parts of the kit. This might cause a rumble in the kits snare, for example. These sounds can be ""rolled off"" at the low end with an EQ, creating a purer sound.


Where percussion is concerned, snare drums generally sound more powerful with a boost in the lower frequencies, whereas hi-hats and toms often sound snappier and punchier with lower frequencies thinned out.

, A compressor limits the amount of frequency expressed in your mix. It will raise the volume of quiet parts, lower the volume of loud parts, and maintain the volume of sounds in your ideal range.Due to human error, you can expect that no single instrument will not be perfectly constant throughout an entire recording. Compression can smooth these irregularities automatically for you.

, Drums and bass form the rhythmic foundation of your song, so be sure you set aside some time to give these a careful listen. Lower frequency sound can be overpowering if you're not careful.Every part should sound distinct, but also cohesive with the whole. If one instrument is excessively bright or dark, it will sound out of place.


Think of the tracks of your mix as members of a choir: each part is separately appreciable, but its goal is work together as a collective.

, Noise gates cut out all noise that doesn't reach a minimum volume. This can be highly useful when a recording has been done in an area with background noise. The buzz of this noise can easily be cut out with a gate.For specific instruments that aren't as regularly occurring in your mix, it may be easiest to lower your fader.
Filtering out unwanted lower volume percussion can be unreasonably difficult when trying to time fading with each sound's “punch."" Gate's are ideal for this situation.
Experiment with noise gates to get a cleaner, crisper sound from your mix.

, How sound moves through the stereo field has a definite effect on the sound you produce in your mix. To find the perfect balance, you'll have to experiment with how you distribute your tracks. Beginners should start with a centered bass part, but then might:Switch off between sides with rhythm guitar and percussion
Place a keyboard track so it is slightly off center.
Add other tracks throughout the field to give your mix a richer, more realistic quality., The chorus effect, for example, will add layers of slightly different timbres and intonations to a track, making it sound like multiple instruments are playing. As a general rule, this effect is useful for electric keyboards and guitar parts.Some other effects you might make use of while mixing:



Reverb - creates a vibration in the sound, often added to guitars and voice to mask less desirable frequencies and create fullness.

Delay - sometimes called ""echo,"" creates one or more defined sound segments and repeats that segment., There are many different kinds of automation you can be use to improve the musicality of your mix. For example, you might automate your master bus to create louder choruses than your verses. This would create a more prominent chorus in your mix.You can also automate effects returns, which can be useful if you want a reverb or a delay to be less prominent in certain sections of a song.

, While you're using your EQ, noise gates, and other effects, you should constantly be listening to your entire production. As you do, make small adjustments to each track while always keeping the whole in mind. With each change, listen to you mix anew. Even if individual parts sound great, the complete product has to sound great as well.

, There are many technical parameters and ranges defined by experts that can blind you to new approaches you might take to achieve your sound. Good sound is a matter of taste. Always trust your ears and never be afraid to break the rules."

Splice and edit your sound files as desired.,
Export your song once it is edited and mixed satisfactorily.,
Burn your song file to disc, if desired.",How to Record a Song with a Camera and Edit the Sound Files in Adobe Premiere Elements," Figure out what instrumentation you want; guitar, piano, bass, percussion? And how, roughly speaking, do you want to mix it? Write it down.;
, This will be the foundation of your song. Piano or guitar are usually good choices.

, This is usually the best way to get the best audio quality. You will have to do some trial and error.

, (See part 2 for importing your audio files). Make sure as you continue to build your song that you are listening to (on headphones) what you've already recorded so that the finished product is IN TIME or SYNC with itself. You do not want the percussion playing faster than the guitar, for instance.

, Your camera will come with its own software for importing videos. Once the files are on your computer, import them into Adobe Premiere Elements.

, This file should be named as name.prel (similar to Word documents, which are name.docx).

, Timeline, not Sceneline, is the only viewing option you should use for these instructions.

, It isn't needed. Keep the audio alone.

, There is a lot of space in Adobe Premiere Elements, so utilize the lines listed as ""soundtrack,"" ""narration,"" ""audio 1,"" etc.

, Adobe Premiere Elements allows you to play with volume and equalizer. If you make adjustments on a file while it is not in playback, the adjustment will be uniform throughout the entire file. If you make adjustments on a file while it is in playback, the adjustments will be saved in real time. Be careful.

, Did you cough on one of the files? Screw up a guitar lick? No worries! Just cut out the undesired audio clip or mute it. Do this after initial mixing so your volume and EQ levels are consistent. Otherwise, if you split your file first, you will need to make the adjustments twice, for each half.

, Adobe Premiere Elements offers several audio file formats for rendering, including MP3 and AAC.

, Open the song file in Windows Media Player or iTunes (or another similar program) and burn the song to disc.

Get your music heard!",How to Promote Your Band," Before you get started, take some time to think about who you are and what you’re about as a band. You should be able to describe your band to others in just a few short, captivating sentences. What is your genre? Who are your influences? You’re a ukulele folk-punk band that sounds like Don Ho jamming with the Sex Pistols? Awesome! That’s the kind of thing people need to hear., A forgettable or overly-bizarre band name can kill you before you begin. Ask your friends and fans for some honest feedback. Is your band name intriguing and memorable? Does it reflect your identity as a band? If not, now’s the time to change it.

, Having a strong social media presence is a must for any up-and-coming band these days. Set up profiles for your band on some or all of the following: Facebook, Myspace, Twitter, Instagram, ReverbNation, etc. Make sure your message is clear across your profiles, and try to make them interesting.


Include pictures of your band, and personal bios of band members. You want people to want to get to know you.Follow other bands that you are interested in, and that are related to your music.

, People will lose interest if you aren’t posting something at least once a week, but don’t go crazy! Aim for a few posts a week about upcoming shows, interesting things going on with band members, pics of recording sessions, etc.


Keep your posts positive and upbeat, and proofread them all before sending them out.
Get yourself noticed by making friendly comments on other bands’ posts.
Be sure to respond to your fan’s comments and posts!

, Social media is great, but you also need page dedicated solely to your band. There are a number of services online designed to help bands create low cost or free web pages. Make sure to keep your page up to date, and post updates frequently.


Make sure and create an email mailing list along with your website so you can email your fans to announce upcoming shows, etc.

, If you and your bandmates are struggling to create and maintain your online presence, hiring an intern can really help. Someone in your band probably has a younger, internet savvy sibling, who would be happy to spend a few hours a week helping to promote the band. Otherwise, place an ad on Craigslist. The best think about interns is that they often work for no or little pay.


Make sure to ask for samples of your applicants’ work when making a choice.
Keep a close eye on what your intern is posting to make sure it stays in line with your band’s vision.

, Choose 2-4 of your best songs, and then record them using the highest-quality equipment you can manage. Rent studio space and use professional equipment if you can afford it, but remember that a lot of bands record their first demos using smartphones or a home computer outfitted with a decent microphone.Take the time to edit your demo and make it sound fantastic!
Distribute your demo tracks both physically on CD, and online.

, There are websites that allow you to create an online promo kit, but you will also need a physical promo kit to send out to local venues, radio stations, etc. Make sure they both have a similar aesthetic and the same information. Your promo kit should look sleek and professional, and include the following:


An eye-catching over page that includes contact information for your band, and basic details.
A band bio. Include a one-page sheet about the band and its history. Try to tell an interesting story that grabs the reader’s attention.
Your demo CD.
A band fact sheet that includes your band name, tagline, genre of music, a list of bands you sound like, hometown, when and where you formed, band member names, instrumentation, and other notable facts.
Any reviews, press clippings, and nifty quotes about your band that you’ve accumulated.
A photo of the band.
A list of previous gigs, including dates and venues.
Label everything with your band’s name and contact information!

, The best way to build a local fan base is to play as many shows as you can. Send your promo kit out to local venues. Go to shows and network with other bands and venue managers to make yourself known and look for opportunities.


Make sure people know about the shows you book. Get the word out on your webpage and social media sites.
Make sure to show up for any gig you book and put on an awesome show!

, Even a young band can put a basic merchandise table without spending a ton of money. Create a cool graphic and have some stickers printed with your band name and contact info. Get some t-shirts printed at a local screen printer, or use an online service (this might be less hassle, but the cost per shirt will be higher).


Include a guest-book or email list sign-up sheet at your merch table.
As your band matures, you can create more elaborate merchandise.

, One of the quickest ways to build a fan base is to distribute your music for free. Give away copies of your demo CD at gigs. Make sure band members always have extras to hand out to people they meet. Create a YouTube channel, and release new songs online as you record them.


People are more likely to engage with your music if there is something to watch along with it. Create self-made session videos and upload them along with your more finely-produced recordings.Create a lot of hype for new recordings by announcing them on social media a few days before releasing them. Get people excited to listen to your new tunes!
Find radio stations that play unsigned artists, and send them your best demo tracks. "

You do not gain copyright protection by simply playing a song over and over again. It must be affixed in a tangible medium.;
, You can give people notice that your music is copyrighted by affixing a symbol to copies of your music. You are not required to give copyright notice. However, it can help warn others that the music is copyrighted.For sound recordings, you should use the letter P within a circle as your symbol. Also include the year the sound recording was first published and the name of the copyright owner.
If you write down your music, then use the letter C within a circle and include the year the music was published, along with the name of the copyright owner.

, You are not required to register it with the Copyright Office. You have a copyright in your music even if you don’t register it. However, registration provides you with many advantages. For example:You generally cannot sue in federal court for someone infringing your copyright unless you have registered the copyright.
In a lawsuit, the court will consider your registration as proof of your ownership.
You can get more compensation in a lawsuit if you are registered. For example, you qualify for attorneys’ fees and statutory damages of up to $150,000 per infringement of your music if you have copyrighted it.

, This publication from the U.S. Copyright office tells you everything you need to know about registering a copyright for music in the United States. The circular will explain whether you are registering a copyright for a “musical composition” or for a “sound recording.” It will also tell you how to register multiple songs in one filing. You should download it and read it.A “musical composition” consists of music and any accompanying words. Usually, composers and lyricists register a copyright in musical compositions.
A “sound recording” consists of a series of musical, spoken, or other sounds. Performers typically copyright sound recordings.
You can register both. If you wrote the music and then performed the song, you can get a copyright for both the musical composition and the sound recording in one filing.

, You can register using the eCO website.You will first need to create a user ID and a password.After creating your account you can view a PDF tutorial which will help get you familiar with the online registration process.Registering online is cheaper than registering using a paper application. It is also generally faster.
You have to deposit a copy of the music with the Copyright Office. You can generally upload an electronic copy or deposit a hard copy through the mail., You can still register using paper applications if you want. Forms are available at the Copyright Office website for download.The form you fill out will depend on what you are copyrighting:


You will have to fill out Form PA if you want to register solely the underlying musical composition.
If you want to register the sound recording, then use Form SR.
If you want to register both the musical composition and the sound recording in one application, then use Form SR., A complete registration will consist of the completed form, examples of the work to deposit with the Copyright Office, and payment of the applicable fee.


Read the form for how many copies of the work you must deposit. Generally, if the work has been published, then you must deposit two. However, if the work was unpublished, then you must submit only one.You can find the current fee schedule by checking the Copyright Office.Make checks or money orders payable to “Register of Copyrights.”

, You should send the completed application to Library of Congress, U.S. Copyright Office, 101 Independence Avenue, SE Washington, DC 20559.If you completed an application online but need to deposit a copy of the music through the mail, then you mail your deposit to the same address.

, You can find out if anyone is distributing copies of your music by creating a Google alert. Once you create the alert, Google will send you an email whenever it finds new content posted online that matches your search terms. To create an alert, you will need a Gmail account. Go to the Google Alerts page and enter the information you want to have an alert created for.You should create alerts for:


your band’s name (such as “Radioactive Redwoods”)
names of each of your songs (e.g., “A Cry in the Forest”)
if you have a copyright in lyrics, then sample lyrics

, You should get into the habit of reviewing every alert at a set time of the day. For example, you might want to look at your alerts the first thing every morning. Try to get in the habit so you don’t skip a day.


If you see that someone has posted your music on a website, then you will need to send the website owner a “takedown” notice. If the owner promptly removes the music, then they can’t be sued. Nevertheless, you must send a notice informing the owner that your music appears on their website.

, In other words, the use of your music can’t be “fair use.” You need to decide whether the use of your music is “fair use” before sending a takedown notice.Fair use is a vague concept which essentially means that some people can copy certain portions of your music in some situations. The court will look at multiple factors, such as how much of your music was sampled and whether the person sampling it “transformed” the sample. The court will also consider why the person sampled your music—for example, for educational purposes or to make money—and whether the sampling had a negative effect on your ability to make money from the song.Generally, you will be justified in sending a takedown notice in most situations. For example, if someone uses an entire song or a large portion of the song, then you are justified in sending a takedown notice.
However, in some situations, the use might be fair use. For example, someone who samples a few seconds of a song to use in a non-profit, educational video, might actually have a fair use defense. If you are unsure whether the sampling is fair use, contact an attorney for advice.

, The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) gives websites and internet service providers protection from a copyright infringement claim when they host material that infringes on your copyright. However, in order to gain that protection, they must promptly remove infringing work when notified. You can contact the website or ISP that is hosting copies of your music and tell them to take it down.


The takedown notice must be in a writing. You should send both a letter and an email to the website’s or ISP’s agent.
Make sure that you identify in your takedown notice what copyrighted work is being infringed. If multiple musical compositions have been infringed, then provide a representative list.
Identify where on the website the alleged infringement has occurred. Also specifically identify the material that is illegally copying your music. If a link is involved, then provide the link.
Give your name and contact information so that you can be reached if there are questions.
State that the information in your takedown notice is accurate and that you “have a good faith belief that the use of this material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.”
State that, “under penalty of perjury,” you are authorized to send the notice on your own behalf or on behalf of the copyright owner.
Include a signature. If you send an email, then include an electronic signature., You can send the notice to the agent for the website that is hosting your music or the internet service provider. You can find the agent in the following ways:


Check the website. Large websites often will list the name of their agent on a “Contact Us” or “Terms of Use” page.
Search the DMCA Agent directory at the U.S. Copyright Office.You can search by the name of the company that owns the website or by the website name.
If you can’t find the website owner, then look for the website’s internet service provider (ISP). You can find this information by searching on the www.whois.net website. Enter the website’s URL. The ISP may be listed.

, Make sure to send it certified mail, return receipt requested. The receipt will serve as proof that the agent received the notice.


You should also send the takedown notice through email. However, if you send by email, also send a letter through the mail.

, The website owner or ISP should promptly remove the music and disable the account of whoever uploaded it to the website. If the music is not removed, or if it shows back up on the same website, you should contact an intellectual property lawyer. You might have to bring a lawsuit.


You can find a qualified attorney by visiting your state or local bar association and asking for a referral. You can find your nearest bar association by visiting the American Bar Association website and clicking on your state.If you have registered your music, then you can get attorneys’ fees if you win.This can make a lawyer affordable, especially if you have a strong case that you are likely to win.

Use your computer.,
Use a mobile app.,
Use a professional decibel meter.",How to Measure Decibels2," With the right programs and equipment, it's not difficult to measure the decibel level of a sound using your computer. Listed below are just a few ways to do this. Note that better recording equipment will always give you better results — in other words, while your computer's default internal microphone may be sufficient for some tasks, a high-quality external microphone will be much more accurate.


If you're on Windows 8, try downloading the free Decibel Reader app from the Microsoft App store. The app uses your computer's microphone to read noises up to 96 decibels.Similar devices are available from the iTunes app store for Apple products.You can also try using a third-party program to measure decibels. For instance, Audacity, a free sound recording program, includes a simple built-in decibel meter , For measuring sound levels on the go, mobile apps can be extremely convenient. Though the microphone on your mobile device isn't as likely to be as high-quality as the sorts of external mics you can connect to a computer, they can be surprisingly accurate. For instance, it's not uncommon for readings from mobile apps to be within 5 decibels of the readings from professional equipment.Below is a brief list of decibel-reading apps available for common mobile platforms:


For Apple devices: Decibel 10th, Decibel Meter Pro, dB Meter, Sound Level Meter
For Android devices: Sound Meter, Decibel Meter, Noise Meter, decibel
For Windows phones: Decibel Meter Free, Cyberx Decibel Meter, Decibel Meter Pro

, Though it's not usually cheap, perhaps the most direct, accurate way to find the decibel level of a sound you with to analyze is to use a decibel meter. Also called a ""sound level meter"", this specialized tool (available from online retailers and specialty stores) uses a sensitive microphone to measure the amount of noise in the environment and give you a precise decibel value. Since there isn't generally a large market for these tools, they can be somewhat expensive — often at least $200 even for low-cost models.Note that decibel meters/sound level meters can go by other names. For instance, another type of tool called a ""noise dosimeter"" performs basically the same function as a standard sound level meter.

Find your sound's intensity in watts/square meter.,
Divide by 10-12.,
Take the Log10 of your answer and multiply by 10.,
Understand the logarithmic nature of decibel values.",How to Measure Decibels3," For everyday practical purposes, decibels are usually seen as a simple measure of loudness. However, the truth is a little more complex. In physics, decibels are often thought of as a convenient way of expressing the intensity of a sound wave. The larger the amplitude of a given sound wave, the more energy it transmits, the more it moves the air particles in its path, and the more ""intense"" the sound is.Because of this direct relationship between a sound wave intensity and and its volume in decibels, it's possible to find a decibel value given nothing more than an intensity level for the sound (which is typically measured in watts/square meter)


Note that, for ordinary sounds, the intensity value is usually very small. For instance, a sound with an intensity of 5 ×10-5 (or 0.00005) watts/square meter translates to about 80 decibels — about the volume of a blender or food processor.
To better understand the relationship between intensity measurements and decibels, let's follow along with an example problem. For the purposes of this problem, let's say that we're music producers and we're trying to find the background noise level in our recording studio to improve the sound of our records. After setting up our equipment, we detect a background noise intensity of 1 × 10-11 (0.00000000001) watts/square meter . In the next few steps, we'll use this info to find the decibel level of the background noise in our studio.

, Once you've found the intensity of your sound, you can simply plug it into the formula 10Log10(I/10-12) (where ""I"" is your intensity in watts/square meter) to find its decibel value. To begin, divide by 10-12 (0.000000000001). 10-12 represents the intensity of a 0 decibel sound, so by comparing your intensity value to this, you're essentially finding its relationship to this base value.


In our example, we'd divide our intensity value, 10-11, by 10-12 to get 10-11/10-12 = 10.

, To finish solving, all you need to do is take the base 10 logarithm of your answer, then, finally, multiply by 10. This accounts for the fact that decibels are logarithmic units with a base of 10 — in other words, an increase of 10 decibels means that the loudness of the sound has doubled.


Our example is easy to solve. Log10(10) = 1. 1 ×10 = 10. Therefore, the background noise in our studio has a loudness of 10 decibels. This is quite quiet, but still detectable with our high-quality recording equipment, so we'll probably need to eliminate the source of the noise for the best recordings

, As noted above, decibels are logarithmic units with a base of 10. For any given decibel value, a noise 10 decibels greater is twice as loud, a noise 20 decibels greater is 4 times as loud, and so on. This makes it easy to describe the huge range of sound intensities that can be picked up by the human ear. The loudest sound the ear can hear without experiencing pain is more than one billion times more intense than the quietest noise it can detect.By using decibels, we avoid having to use huge numbers to describe common sounds — instead, we only need to use three digit numbers at most.


Consider this — which is easier to use: 55 decibels or 3 × 10-7 watts/square meter? The two are equivalent, so rather than having to use scientific notation (or a very small decimal), decibels allow for us to use a sort of simple shorthand for easy everyday use.

, Most of the time you can’t even hear this low end, but when you have 30 tracks playing simultaneously the effect can be cumulative. The solution is to strip every track of any unwanted low frequencies. You will not need to do this for bass guitar or certain drums such as kick or tom-tom. Just because you don’t want to remove the low end completely on some tracks doesn't mean that they won’t require low end adjustment. Low end can be stripped from any track using a bell filter or a high pass filter. I prefer a combination of the two, but every circumstance calls for unique settings.,, A low pass filter works similarly with respect to high frequencies instead of low., A common mistake is to add high frequencies to fix the problem of having too many low ones. You are better off removing frequencies instead. Keep in mind whenever you boost a frequency, you introduce noise. Always try to remove frequencies first before adding them. A bell filter is what is used for the majority of equalization. Notice the “Type” box already shows a bell filter by default.,,, Change the “Q” from 7(the default) to 5 and see what happens in the graphical representation. Play around with these settings until you don’t hear any unwanted low frequencies. Every microphone has a unique frequency response, and every singer is different. You will need to make adjustments until it sounds good to you., Take the Pacific Pro Audio LD1 for instance. It doesn't pick up high frequencies that great. What can be done to fix this is bring down the frequencies that don’t need boosting and boost the highs a few decibels(dB) as shown above in figure 1.1., A DeEsser falls into the family of compression/limiting. A compressor levels out the peaks and valleys in a waveform. It lowers the amplitude of any waveform above a certain amplitude. This allows the engineer to make quiet parts audible without making the loud parts louder. Without compression, pops and clicks in a funk bassline would be quite painful to listen to (literally) at nominal levels. A little compression can spare you hours of volume automation work on a vocal track. The letter “S” always sounds much louder than anyone wants it to when pronounced into a microphone. A DeEsser is a form of compression specifically designed to remove the unwanted artifacts introduced into the waveform as a result of pronouncing the letter ""S"" into a microphone. A DeEsser cuts the amplitude of the frequencies specific to the letter ""S"" when those frequencies rise above a certain amplitude. Removing these frequencies with a DeEsser enables you to leave those frequencies present in the track at every point in time the letter ""S"" is not being pronounced. Controls:

Threshold

, Your S' s should appear a bit too loud. This will be especially apparent at higher decibel levels., Threshold is the point of loudness at which the “S” frequencies begin to drop. The lower the threshold, the more “S” frequencies get removed. Notice the attenuation meter. Attenuation is what is removed. Every time an “S” goes through the DeEsser the attenuation meter will show how much of the “S” is removed., With your ""S""'s still on looped playback, move the frequency somewhere between 7,000 and 12,000 Hz. Move the frequency around and watch the attenuation meter. Find the frequency value that shows the most attenuation. This is your “S” center frequency.,, There are over a dozen compressors in the Waves Mercury Bundle©. Many of them, such as Renaissance Vox, have had controls removed for easier functionality. The C1 compressor has no such functionality removed.

, If there’s just one instrument such as a piano or guitar involved and the singer is consistent enough, you may not need compression. It isn't until many voices play simultaneously before quiet parts of the vocals get drowned out., Ratio relates two values about the threshold: input level above the threshold, and output level above the threshold. A ratio of 4:1 means that if an input signal is 4dB above the threshold, the output signal will be 1 dB above the threshold, effectively reducing the peaks in a waveform., The lower your threshold, the flatter your waveform will get. If this were drums or bass you would want the value for “attack” to be considerably lower. For vocals the default value of 2.00 works., Implementing the compression settings so far has decreased the volume of your vocal track considerably. “Makeup” adds gain to compensate for the volume drop. Slide the “Makeup” fader up until your vocals sound natural in the mix and your output signal is healthy without clipping., Delays come in a few varieties:

Tap delays allow you to click a button to set the delay time. This is handy if you don’t know how many milliseconds of a delay that you need numerically but you do know how long of a delay you want.
Time Adjustment or straight delays are useful to correct for latency. Latency is an unavoidable delay that happens as a result of processors taking time to process data before it can send it to your speakers. The more processor demanding an insert is the more latency it will introduce. It is often necessary to add a time adjustment delay on other tracks to keep them in perfect time with ones containing processor demanding effects. Your multitracking program will display latency for each track.
Ping pong delays are stereo delays that alternate the signal between the left and the right.
Phase/Flange delays are very short delays which are used to purposefully create loss of audio attributed to two superimposing audio signals being slightly out of phase. Phase delays are the shortest and remove certain frequencies creating an odd effect. Flange delays are a little longer and also produce a phase like effect.

, For most purposes, the medium delay is appropriate:

The stereo Mod Delay II allows you to take a mono signal, split it into stereo, and assign a different amount of delay time to the left and to the right. Controls:

, This has the effect of bringing out the vocals slightly without turning them up. This mostly works best when there are many instruments being played at once.Note that adding this mono to stereo effect your track has switched from mono to stereo. You can now pan the left and the right separately., This will add a slight delay to just the right side.,,, It may be difficult to notice the difference between delay and no delay in this circumstance, because there is such a small amount being added. The key to appropriate use of effects is subtlety. You may not be able to tell there is any delay at all if this technique is done right, however, upon listening you can often hear a quality disappear when the effect gets bypassed., This vocal embellishment delay does not necessarily belong in all vocal tracks., There are two Waves™ reverbs that can be useful. These are the IR1, and Renaissance Verb(RVerb). This is RVerb:

RVerb is a stereo plug in. If you insert it into a mono track it will change it into a stereo track. Make sure to pan appropriately. Reverb is the most overused and abused audio effect. Originally intended to simulate a sound being played inside a hall or room, reverb is now used in a variety of applications. Be very careful to avoid turning the reverb up very high. The key to good reverb usage is subtlety. A little goes a long way. Controls:

, You should keep it down to 1.00 most of the time.,, If done right, you won’t be able to tell there is any reverb on the vocals at all unless you solo the vocal track., Certain effects you do not want active all the time. There are some effects that can add incredible feeling to a project when strategically placed. Effect instances are used in 90% of popular music to accentuate or create a feeling during a key point in a musical recording., Preverb is backwards reverb. Instead of the reverberation happening after the parent waveform it happens before., Name one Preverb L, the other Preverb R., Make sure to line up the audio in Preverb L to Preverb R exactly., If there’s no “Reverse” in your plug-ins, you will most likely find it in the edit menu.,, Using RVerb, drop Wet/Dry down to 50% then process the audio.,,, You will have to slide the processed waveforms over until they line up with the original., Adjust the volume level to just barely audible for Preverb L and Preverb R. Use EQ8 to pull out the lows on Preverb L and Preverb R. Make any adjustments in equalization to the preverb tracks., This instance is much easier to create than preverb. First, decide on a single word you wish to accentuate or bring out. Create a track named Delay and copy that word into it.,, Lower the volume until it is barely audible so the effect is subtle. Apply equalization., Many artists make use of distorted vocals. Most of the time it ends up sounding like someone singing into a bullhorn. The effect can be quite pleasing when done correctly. Create a new track called Bullhorn Vox. Add an EQ8 to the inserts on Bullhorn Vox. Add a Sans Amp plug-in after the EQ8. There are many pleasing combinations of equalization and the Sans Amp plug-in when creating bullhorn vocals."

You wanted to make just one track ? Well, Hardcore is certainly one of the hardest music genre, and thus, finding people who truly enjoy it, finding tutorials or label interested (this will come much later after you start producing) WILL be hard. Are you sure you want to become a Hardcore producer ?;
,


What is a DAW ? It's a music producing software; if you didn't know it then you will probably need a lot of time before actually producing tracks. Personally, I use FL Studio, but you can also try one of the various others, like Cubase, Ableton, Pro Tool, Reason, Logic... Keep in mind that some of them only work on PC, while some other only work on Mac. Some also work on both. Tip the name on a search engine, then go to the website and download a demo to get an idea of how it works. But keep in mind that if you illegally download the software, the music you'll make won't belong to you.

It may contain extremely useful tools that will make producing music easier and funnier, as well as giving more qualities to your tracks. Look for tutorials on YouTube and WikiHow.

These will help you create your sound, may it be the drums, the melody... Don't buy expensive one at first : If you are a beginner, why would you need hundreds of virtual instruments if you can't even understand one?

,


You'll want them to sound as ""neutral"" as possible : what does it mean ? Well, if you used your mobile phone speaker to make your music, you would try to make it sound as good as possible... on your mobile phone. Your track could be heard anywhere : In a club, in a car, in your room... and what sound awesome on your mobile phone speaker will sound like %#?! on your computer speakers.

,


This is a simple question, with a long list of answers. We'll go for the technical ones, which are the one that will interest us : Hardcore is a kind of powerful techno, with heavy kick and bass that usually resort to distortion. The tempo is usually between 150 and 200 BPM, although faster genre exist (Speedcore can be at 300 BPM and higher; Flashcore use ultra fast BPM and ""kicks barrage""). Use the definition to make your tracks. What is the structure of a track ?

Mixing isn't just what a DJ does at nightclub, this is was a sound designer does. If the guitarist of a band play too loud, you won't hear the voices, the other instruments, and the overall will sound like garbage. You will need to add effect, adjust volume to almost everything so the end result will sound good.

While this tutorial cover some of the basis, you will need to do your own research on the web. Go on dedicated forums, ask your questions, see how the other do this and that.

, Thus, some important things essential in studios aren't mentioned, like the need for reference speakers. If you seriously get in the music production, these will definitely helps. Having panels to avoid sound echoing and altering the sound you hear will help... If you already know how to make music.

It will help you see how the program works on your machine. The faster your CPU, the more you’ll be able to do simultaneously in FL Studio Demo., Download the latest version from image-line.com. You’ll need 1GB of free disk space, and about 1GB of RAM is recommended to run the program. Versions are available for PC and Mac in 32- or 64-bits.On PCs, you’ll need Windows XP, Vista, 10, or later.
For Macs, you’ll need Boot Camp/Windows (or OS X 10.8 or 10.9 for a Beta version). Yosemite is not supported.

, Start the program and look at the setup and options. There’s a toolbar at the top and five main windows, listed here with their respective keyboard shortcut keys.Channel rack (F6): This includes your instruments as plugins. Plugins are the main way you add new instruments, and you can use instruments individually or in combination. Note that the height of the rack will change as you add or remove plugins.
Piano roll (F7): The piano roll loads the note data from plugin instruments on its channel. Pitch is displayed on the vertical axis, and time is on the horizontal axis. This display will help you track visually what you’re playing musically.Mixer (F9): All audio passes through the mixer. Your channels on the channel rack are bound to the mixer tracks.
Playlist (F5): This is the player that plays (sequences) all the sounds that comprise your final song.Browser (Alt + F8): The browser is a table of contents with three important sections: All, Current Project, and Plugin database. Through these, you can access projects, samples, plugins, and libraries., Plan the basics of your song on some paper, your computer’s word processing program, or a spreadsheet before you start making it. Determine what instruments and plugins you might want to use or at least start with. Simulate the program by using either a piece of grid paper or your computer.


If it's a short 3-4 minute song, you may wish to start off with a simple melody, pads, vocals, and so on.

, Particularly if you are doing an extended piece, consider building the track in layers.


The first layer can be a drum pattern to establish the beat. A 4/4 time beat is common in pop and dance songs. Another way of thinking about this is to emphasize the first and third beats of a measure.
Bring in a simple bass line. The most common bass line would probably be a bass guitar sound or a standing bass, but you could also try a bass sax, tuba, or related sounds.
You can then add in the melody on top of this. With rhythm and bass established, you can get a better feel for the track and begin to introduce melody. Begin simply with a few of FL Studio’s pre-recorded chords. This will give a richness and depth to your sound that individual notes often lack.

, FL Studio Demo includes a full group of software instruments, with each channel containing one instrument plugin. You add a plugin/instrument by clicking the “+” sign on a channel.


Usually, an instrument is a synthesizer or a sample player, used to make your melodies and percussions.
FL Studio also offers vintage instruments and analog-sounding ones.There are also special effects and sample voice sounds.
You can add new instruments by adding new plugins through a Virtual Studio Technology (VST) interface. You may want to add an instrument if, for example, you don’t see the instrument you want, you want to use a rare/uncommon instrument, or you want to try a different version of an instrument you do have.

, For melody especially, you’ll usually want to plan one instrument at a time as you would do using the piano roll. That said, you don’t have to map out your entire song. You may get inspired on the spot to fill in remaining gaps in the track. You might also intentionally leave space in the song for improvisation.

, A step-based drum machine lets you create your own beats. The step system rounds note length to an established duration, making note length uniform. You can also use something called the Fruity Slicer to chop up breaks.The Fruity Slicer plugin can be added through the Channels menu in the Main menu bar.

, It's best to plan your song in advance, and start working on it the next time you have a whole day to work on it in one sitting. If you can leave your computer in sleep mode, you may leave your project overnight and come back to it at a later time.

, You can enter notes directly through the piano roll. Alternatively, you can play music live using a controller keyboard. The step sequencer plays percussion samples, and you can record with Step Recording on the Recording Panel., A sequencer is an interface that records, edits, and plays back audio samples.The recording and playback features of a sequencer is one of the biggest advantages of composing digitally, rather than with individual analog instruments.


Left-click on step-sequencer squares to turn them on, and right click to turn them off.
To change patterns, go to the Pattern Selector in the toolbar, and slide (left-click and hold) squares up and down., You have a lot of freedom here in FL Studio. You can arrange clips in any order you like and overlay clips as well. You can even think of clips like notes in the piano roll. Use the Playlist window to make your clip arrangements. There, you can add, delete, slice (Fruity Slicer!), rearrange, or mute clips., Left click an instrument channel button in the channel rack to select a mixer track, which will then be highlighted with a green fader. This is where all the sound from your instruments is routed. So, think of the mixer as a filter you can use to modify sound as it travels through the mixer.


Use the mixer for levels and effects, such as reverb and delay. These effects are also automatable. Recorded sound will be displayed in the Playlist as an Audio Clip. Use the Playlist window to play back audio and rearrange clips.

, In any channel, you can go to the Piano Roll window and the Tools menu to select the Riff Machine. This includes a wide variety of riffs, chords, and arpeggios that you can adjust. As opposed to building music note by note, riffs offer depth through multiple notes, and chords add multiple notes played simultaneously.


Click Throw Dice to begin a new melody/beat, and then click Accept to add it to Piano Roll.Try pre-recorded chords. Also in the Piano Roll Tools Menu, find the Chords submenu. Here, you can add chords to the Piano Roll without having to create and play them manually., This means adjusting the distribution of your sound through different channels, such as left and right speakers. Most songs don’t sound as good when they’re played in just one channel (mono). Listen to your song through completely and do a bit of mixing. You might need to adjust the panning and volume.

, Maybe you’ve tried recording riffs or segments of your track already, but remember to record your complete track as well. FL Studio has a helpful function if you forget: it remembers MIDI notes from about the previous five minutes, even when not recording. To regain a riff, go to an empty pattern, and then click “Dump Score Log To Selected Channel”., Before you export your song, you can go into options and modify the ""project info"" or metadata that a media player will display. Here, you can change such things as the name your song, the artist's name, comments, and the song's genre.

, You can save to file forms WAV, MP3, MIDI and OGG.Exporting is done through the File menu in a process called rendering. Pull down the menu and select the file type and quality you’d like to save your project as.


You won’t be able to play back saved projects in the FL Studio Demo version. To open saved projects fully, you’ll have to register FL Studio and plugins.
The only other limitation of the demo version is that you might also hear some static, white noise, or silence using some of the plugins.That said, the demo version is still very functional and a great way to learn FL Studio.

Decide on a microphone(s) to use in your studio.",How to Make a Cheap Recording Studio," If you don't already have a computer to use in your recording setup, you will need to purchase one. Important considerations are processing speed and amount of memory, as recording software tends to use your computer's resources heavily. Both Windows and Mac platforms will work well; however, Windows machines typically allow for easier upgrading of the sound card. Factory-installed sound cards are not usually robust enough to produce high-quality recordings, so upgrading is a good idea.;
, The recording software provides the interface through which you will manage your recordings on your computer. There are several options for small budgets. Generally, the more expensive applications offer greater functionality and flexibility.

For recording on a very small budget, you can use recording software licensed as freeware or shareware. Audacity and GarageBand are 2 popular choices for low-budget recording.
With a slightly higher budget, you can purchase near-professional quality recording software such as Ableton Live or Cakewalk Sonar. Both of these applications are also available in entry-level versions that are less expensive but less powerful.

, An audio interface is a piece of hardware that replaces your computer's sound card and allows you to connect your instruments and microphones to your computer through a mixer. On a PC, you will usually install your audio interface in an empty PCI slot. On a Mac, you may need to purchase an interface that can be connected through a USB or FireWire cable.


At the least, make sure your audio interface has 2 input and 2 output jacks. This will allow you to record in stereo. For more flexibility, choose an interface with 4 input jacks.
One of the top manufacturers of audio interfaces for home use is M-Audio. They produce both entry-level and high-end models.

, A mixer is an essential piece of equipment for any home recording studio. The mixer handles all your inputs (such as microphones, guitars, and keyboards), allows you to adjust each input's settings, and routes the output to your audio interface and into your computer.


The basic functions on an inexpensive mixer will usually be adequate for home recording needs. At the least, make sure each channel on your mixer includes adjustments for panning, volume, and 3-band equalization. Four channels will be more than adequate for home recording.
Popular brands for entry-level mixers are Behringer, Alesis, and Yamaha.

, The speakers you use to listen to your mix during editing are called studio monitors (sometimes referred to as reference speakers). Studio monitors differ from other speakers in that they are meant to deliver a perfectly flat frequency response. This means that you are hearing your recording exactly as it exists digitally, without any frequency adjustment.


When choosing studio monitors, make sure to look for ""near-field"" models. These are designed to be listened to from about a yard (1 m) away, and so eliminate any effects due to the acoustics of your room.
Studio monitors can be purchased used from online classifieds sites or audio retailers. The robust, simple construction of loudspeakers makes them an ideal component to buy used and save money.
In addition to or in place of monitors, you can buy a set of headphones. Headphones provide the advantage of being cheaper, smaller, and less likely to disturb a neighbor or housemate. Headphones can be used in conjunction with studio monitors to assess very low-volume components of your recordings.

, An inexpensive home recording studio can be managed with only a single microphone if necessary.

If you only buy 1 mic, make sure to choose a dynamic mic. This type of construction is more robust and versatile, and is self-powered. An industry standard dynamic mic is the Shure SM-57, which can be used for vocals and instruments.






If you need to record very quiet or expressive instruments, such as an acoustic guitar or piano, a condenser mic will provide better results. Condenser mics aren't as rugged or versatile as dynamic mics, but provide more sensitive response. A cheap recording studio can readily make do with 1 dynamic and 1 condenser microphone.

Unplug your speakers.,
Connect the amplifier output to the crossover.,
Connect the crossover output to the speakers.,
Test it out.",How to Hook up a Crossover1," If there are speakers currently wired up to your stereo system, fully disconnect them.;
, Using speaker wire or RCA cables (depending on your stereo system and crossover unit), connect the crossover to your amplifier just as you would a speaker.


The crossover should be the last piece of equipment in the chain before the speakers. Depending on your setup, this means your crossover could be wired directly between your amplifier and your speakers, or the crossover could be placed in line after a compressor or equalizer.Depending on your crossover and stereo setup, you will probably need separate crossover units for the left and right channels of your stereo system.
Connect the output of the amplifier to the crossover inputs by attaching speaker wires to the positive and negative terminals of your amplifier and the corresponding inputs of the crossover. Use the red wire for the positive terminal, black for the negative. Slide the exposed wire ends into place and tighten the terminals.
Depending on your amplifier and crossover unit, this can be done either by flipping small switches above the terminals, or by tightening screws with either a screwdriver or allen wrench.
If there is not enough exposed wire at ends of your speaker wires, you may need to strip off up to half an inch of insulation with wire strippers.

, Attach your speakers to the crossover using speaker wire, similarly to the previous step.


Your crossover should have separate outputs for your woofers (bass speakers) and tweeters (treble speakers). Make sure to wire the correct speaker into the correct output.
On many models of crossover, they will be labeled W+ and W- for the woofer positive and negative outputs and T+ and T- for the tweeter.

, Once you've wired the left and right channels, play some music through your system. You should a clean sound from both channels.


If your crossover is adjustable and you aren't happy with the sound you're getting, try adjusting the frequency knobs, or consult the instructions for recommended settings.

Tune your system.",How to Hook up a Crossover2," If you have speakers already connected to your stereo, fully disconnect them.

, Active crossover units are larger than passive ones and need to be mounted in a stable location, ideally near your amplifiers.Do not mount your crossover directly to a metal rack, as this can cause buzzing and other sound problems.

, Using the appropriate cables, wire your crossover into the receiver or preamp, with the wires coming out of the receiver going into the ""in"" terminals on the crossover.


Depending on your receiver and your stereo system, you will probably be making this connection with RCA cables, but some crossovers will are set up to use speaker wire instead (as detailed in Method 1) if your receiver doesn't have RCA outputs.Crossovers designed for PA systems sometimes use quarter inch cables, like those used to plug in an electric guitar, or XLR cables, like those used to plug in a microphone., Using the appropriate cables (again, usually RCA or speaker wire for a home stereo system), connect the appropriate outputs to the appropriate amplifiers.


If you don't have a subwoofer, you'll send your high frequency signal to your tweeter amp and low-frequency signal to your woofer amp. In this case, make sure your crossover is set to two-way mode. There should be a switch that controls this. If you can't locate it, check your instruction manual.
Connect the left output of each frequency range to the left input of the coinciding amplifier and the right output of each frequency range to the right input of the coinciding amplifier.

, There are several ways to hook up a subwoofer to your system. Whichever you choose, you'll need to set up your crossover so that the mid-frequency signal is being sent to the woofers, but the low-frequency signal is not.One approach is to use additional cables from your crossover to your subwoofer (or subwoofer amplifier, if your subwoofer doesn't have it's own power). In this scenario, you'll set the crossover to three-way mode if you're connecting to separate woofers and tweeters, or the two-way mode if you are running the main speakers with a full-range signal and just sending the bass to the subwoofer.Another approach is to run cables directly from the subwoofer-out (sub out) terminals of your receiver. If you have a newer receiver, it may have its own crossover settings for a subwoofer, so you won't need to use an external crossover for this.If your receiver does not have subwoofer settings, your subwoofer itself most likely has a built-in crossover. These typically will not provide the optimum sound, but are easy and convenient, and also allow you to skip the external crossover unit.If you are hooking up your subwoofer to an external crossover, turn the subwoofer's built-in crossover to its maximum rotation to remove it from the circuit. Having multiple crossovers functioning at once can make the bass input uneven or erratic.Avoid connecting subwoofers with speaker wire. It doesn't handle bass signals as well as sturdier cables., Active crossovers require power to function. Home stereo and PA system crossovers usually just plug into an outlet, while car stereo units like the one shown in the video below need to be connected to the car's power supply through the fuse box or in some cases the amplifier will have a terminal for sending power to a crossover., At this stage, you'll want to fine-tune your system to get a sound you like. The manual for your crossover should have some tips for doing this, but you can also follow the guidelines below. At the beginning of the this process, make sure the input gain on your crossover is turned all the way down (if it has an input gain knob), set your amplifier gains low, and if you have an equalizer, turn it off or set the levels all flat.Turn on the system and play some music that you are familiar with. This way, you'll have a good sense of what you think the music is meant to sound like.
Slowly turn up the input gain on the crossover until sound comes out of all your speakers.
Adjust the level for each output on the crossover until the frequencies are playing at an equal volume. As every crossover model is different, you should consult your manual for details on how to do this, as well as the manufacturer's recommended settings.
One by one, turn up your amplifiers' gains until the music begins to distort a little, then roll them back to just below the distortion threshold. Readjust the crossover frequencies as necessary to restore balance between the frequencies.
Turn on your equalizer and begin making adjustments to the sound to suit your personal preferences. Make any adjustments you want on your receiver as well, e.g. the tone, etc. Again, readjust the crossover frequencies until the sound is balanced.
Keep fine tuning your adjustments on the receiver, equalizer, and crossover until you get a sound mix you like.

Use this method to connect an equalizer to your car stereo in a remote location for additional space.,
Decide where you would like to mount the equalizer.,
Purchase 2 pairs of RCA cables.,

Connect the RCA cables to your in-dash receiver.,
Bring the cables to the equalizer and plug in.,
Mount your equalizer to the vehicle.,
Turn off your ignition.,
Connect your ground wire.,
Connect the power cable.,
Connect the remote turn-on wire.,
Test the equalizer by turning on the car.,
Replace the receiver.",How to Hook up an Equalizer4," Some equalizers are designed for installation in your dash while others are designed for a remote location such as the trunk. The installation location will depend on your particular choice of equalizer and preferences.


Many prefer to install their equalizers in their trunk near the amp so that they have the option to easily add additional amps later.
Some vehicles will not have space in the dash for an equalizer and will need to remote-mount their equalizer.
Equalizers can be installed anywhere between your amp and receiver.
Most remote-mount equalizers will come with a remote so that you can change the controls from the driver’s seat.

, Most people prefer to mount their remote-mount equalizer in their trunk near the amp. This way they can easily add additional amps later on by connecting a close wire. Other possible locations include under a seat in the vehicle.


Remember that wherever you mount your equalizer, you will have to run wires to your head unit, or receiver, and amplifier.

, To run a signal from your stereo receiver to the equalizer and back again, you'll need 2 sets of RCA cable (the same kind that is usually used to connect source components like turntables and CD players).


The length of the RCA cables should match the length of the distance between the receiver and the equalizer.

, Remove your receiver from the dash so that you can access the wires behind. Usually you can pull off the plastic piece covering the dash and then pull the receiver slightly out.

, Plug the two RCA cables into the receiver’s preamp outputs. Tape them together so they will not come apart.

, Route the cables through the dash to the equalizer. You should use tape or wire ties along the way to connect the two cables together. Plug the cables into the preamp inputs on your equalizer., Do not mount your equalizer directly to the metal chassis. This will interfere with the sound. It is better to mount the equalizer on a platform or some kind of rubber material to prevent interference.


If you must bolt the equalizer directly to the metal chassis, then you should use rubber pieces between the equalizer and the vehicle.

, Turn off your ignition completely and remove your keys before you begin installation. This is for your safety while you connect the wires to avoid getting shocked.

, On your equalizer you will see three wires. The black one is the ground wire. Remove a bolt near the equalizer mounting location and scrape away any paint covering the location around the bolt. Crimp a ring on the end of the wire and bolt this to the vehicle.


If there is no location available then you will have to drill a hole in the chassis. Be very careful not to damage the gas tank or brake line while doing this.

, The yellow wire (could be red or another color- check your manual) on your equalizer is the 12V power cable. Connect this cable either to the power cable attached to the receiver or to a 12V variable power source in the fuse box (such as the wiper fuse).


If your receiver does not have a wiring diagram to show which wires are switched power cables, then you should use a digital multimeter to identify the correct cable. Connect the multimeter to the cable when the key is in the off position and make sure the voltage reads at zero. Then turn the key into the on position and see if there is now 12V. If the wire follows this pattern then you have found the correct switched 12V power wire.

Splice the wires together and wrap the exposed metal with electrical tape completely. This prevents the exposed areas from touching other wires and potentially shorting the system.
You can also crimp the wires together but this is not as strong as splicing.
This wire will need to be routed from the receiver to wherever the equalizer is mounted.

, This wire will usually be a blue wire with a white stripe, and should be labeled on your equalizer. On the receiver should be a blue (usually blue but can be other colors) wire that goes to the amplifier. Connect this wire to the blue wire on the receiver after routing it through the vehicle from where the equalizer is located.


Splice or crimp the wires together to make a connection and then wrap the connection in electrical tape.

, Put the key in the ignition and turn it to the “on” position. Then turn on the radio to check that everything is working well and that the equalizer turns on with the radio.

, Put the receiver back into its bracket and place the frame covering back into place. Be sure all the wiring is pushed inside the dash beforehand.

Many prefer to install their equalizers in the dash of the vehicle so that they can have access to the controls continuously.
Equalizers can be installed anywhere between your amp and receiver.

, The best place to install an in-dash equalizer is right above or below your head unit, or stereo control unit. Some vehicles will have space for this in their dash. Other vehicles will not have space and the equalizer can then be mounted under the dash. The final option is to custom-fit your equalizer into the dash.


If you have space in your dash, then you will simply need an installation kit to mount your equalizer. These kits are brackets that hold the head unit to the dash and require only a few screws to attach. Your kit will come with particular instructions for mounting.
If you do not have space in your dash you will need an under-dash mounting kit. These kits are usually designed for under the dash on the driver’s side although other options are available. There are many different designs for under-dash kits so choose on that you prefer and works well with your vehicle.
If you would like to have a custom install then it is best to leave the job to a professional audio installer.

, To run a signal from your stereo receiver to the equalizer and back again, you'll need 2 sets of RCA cable (the same kind that is usually used to connect source components like turntables and CD players).


The length of the RCA cables should match the length of the distance between the receiver and the equalizer. To avoid ""cable clutter,"" it's best to buy ""patch"" size cables, which are only about a foot (30 cm) in length.

, Remove your receiver from the dash so that you can access the wires behind. Usually you can pull off the plastic piece covering the dash and then pull the receiver slightly out.

, Plug the two RCA cables into the receiver’s preamp outputs. Tape them together so they will not come apart.

Never show that you are upset, to the person declining your music.,
Be gracious.,
Keep your rejection to yourself.,
Reflect on your music.,
Consider a voice teacher.,
Never take negative responses as a sign to stop singing, playing or writing music.,
Never stop learning about your instrument or your voice.,
Don't get discouraged.,
Keep working, and keep seeking feedback.",How to Deal with Rejection of Your Music," The reason for the rejection might just be that they aren't looking for an artist like you. They may want a different genre or a different styling. Sometimes it is just that you have brown hair or you are a man and they need a female singer. Put on a good front. Be a good sport. This is so important because they may like your next project or your revise and if you make a big deal about how upset the negative response made you, they may not want to work with you in the future.;
, After you receive the negative response thank the person for their honest opinion, and ask them how they think you can improve your work. This shows you care about your music and want to learn how to improve it.

, Don't go advertising that someone hated your music or song. This is one of the biggest mistakes artist and songwriters do.

, When you get home and you are feeling the blues because of the negative response, take some time and listen to the songs again with their advice in mind. Write down ways you can improve on the song or your voice. After you do this I advise you to take some time away from that song, not long, but enough time that you can get an objective viewpoint yourself.

, If you are having pitching issues on the song don't worry, call a voice teacher ASAP. Voice teachers are essential for all singers. Yes, even the good ones need voice teachers. The reason voice is taught is to help you learn how to build and maintain a solid voice. The voice teacher will work with your flaws and help you to improve. So they say you are tone deaf, this isn't a life sentence to never perform again. Go to a voice teacher and have them help you with finding tones. There is a way to learn this and a good voice teacher will be able to help you.

, Rather, take the rejection as a learning tool. When you evaluate your music and improve on the work it makes a better musician out of you. Many times new songwriters or singers and musicians present their work way too early in the creative process. Maybe your work is just not a finished product.

, Great musicians are always learning new ways to present their talent.

, Try to keep you head up, not everyone is truthful either. Maybe they have a reason for putting your talent or music down. Some people do this when they are jealous of others.

, The next step is to get another opinion after you improve on your project. The next answer may be a ""yes""!

Play your guitar a bit and listen.,
If you're too dirty, turn down the gain and low/bass frequencies.,
If you sound too bright, roll down your guitar's tone and your amps high/treble frequencies.,
If it sounds dull or weak, try adding a hint of reverb at the amp or with a pedal.",How to Get a Good Jazz Guitar Tone," Jazz guitar tone is usually very simple and clean, and though some guys like John Scofield might play with distorted tones, most jazz groups will want a sound that blends into the mix better. You aren't playing a lead role like you might in a rock band, so get ready to back down your master volume too.;
, The volume and tone controls on your guitar are there for a reason, and it's not to be rolled all the way up all the time. Set your guitar volume around seven or eight (if you don't have marked knobs, just estimate) and set the tone around halfway. You'll be adjusting as you go but this is a good way to hear the basic sound of your guitar and amp.

, Play some lead lines and strum some chords. Is your tone too bright? Too distorted? Figure out what you want in a guitar tone and what you don't like about your current sound.

, If your amp has a lot of headroom, then you can get away with a higher gain setting, but if your amp distorts quickly, then you'll need to turn that down. Depending on your speaker size, lower notes can make your speaker distort too.

, Don't go too low, or you will be inaudible during solos, but try out different settings and see what works. Consider playing with your fingers if you're a fan of Wes Montgomery's tone.

, You don't want to sound like a rockabilly player, but a bit of reverb can give you a fuller tone and make you sound better in an acoustically dead room.

Distribute copies of the signed agreement.",How to Draft a Recording Contract," You want the contract to be easy to read, so make sure that you set the font to a comfortable size and style. Times New Roman 12 point is fairly standard.


You can also play around with bold and larger font sizes if you want to emphasize certain portions of the contract.;
, At the top of the first page, you should center “Artist Recording Contract” between the right- and left-hand margins.You can make the title a little larger than the rest of the type.

, At the beginning, you should identify the artist and the recording company. You should create the contract as a template that can be used more than once. To do so, you should insert blank lines for the date and the artist’s name.


Sample language could read, “This agreement made of between (‘company,’ ‘Record Label,’ or ‘Recording Company’) and (‘artist’).”, Recitals are the “whereas” clauses that describe the general nature or background of the contract.You will want to include recitals that describe the desires of each party. It is standard for recitals to be fragment sentences.


You could write: “Whereas the parties desire to enter into a contract whereby the artist will record songs for the recording company and that company will try to market the songs for a period of 12 months starting with the date this agreement is signed. Now, therefore, in consideration of the mutual benefits and obligations contained in this agreement, the following agreement is made.”, The contract might contain terms you need to define because they would not be understood by the average person. If you end up in court in a contract lawsuit, you will want the judge to understand how you are using terms. Accordingly, you should define any terms you don’t think are clear.


One term you will definitely need to define is “territory.” The record label gets rights to only certain territories. When signing a new artist, the label usually defines the “territory” as the entire world.More established artists will try to get separate contracts for different territories, such as North America.
You might want to save this step for last. Once you finish a draft of the contract, you can then go back through it and identify unclear terms.

, An artist needs to present you with some songs before you agree to market him or her. Accordingly, you should explain the initial recording obligation. For example, a recording company might require that the artist cut a minimum of five songs using the company’s master sound tracks. You should explain how the costs of recording these songs will be charged back to the artist.


For example, you could write, “The artist is under a ‘recording obligation’ for the next 12 months. The artist will fund the initial cost of presenting him or herself to the record company with a minimum of at least five songs, recorded using company master sound tracks. If the record label signs the artist, then further recording obligations will be at the label’s expense. However, the artist must understand that all monies furnished to the artist will be charged back to his or her account. All of the money will be recovered from the artist’s publishing, record sales, personal appearances, corporate sponsorships, and product sales of all kinds. There are no ‘free rides’ in the music business, and all costs are recoupable by the company.”, You might not charge back all expenses to the artist. If not, then identify those costs which you won’t charge back. For example, you might not charge for the following:


manufacture of the single record on compact disc
mailing, labor, and postage related to mailing the single to all radio reporter stations
service and re-service costs
in-house label promotion

, You might get a deal for an album from one of the major labels or major independent record labels during the 12-month term of the contract. However, the contract might have expired before you can record it. You should include a provision where the artist agrees to come back and record the album in this situation.


For example, you could write: “Artist may be called back to record at least one album on behalf of the record label after the contract period expires should the company have a contractual offer in hand from one of the major labels or major independent record labels. This obligation is called the artist’s ‘overcall album.’ The company may exercise an option at any time the company has written offers in hand. The ‘overcall album’ shall be completed subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement. Artist will be provided with sufficient notice of the option being exercised in writing at least 30 days prior to the notice of time to appear to record.”, During the term of the contract, you don’t want the artist recording or performing for anyone else. For this reason, you should include a term where the artist agrees to be exclusive to your recording company.


Use a clause like this: “Artist agrees that during the period of this agreement that he/she will not perform for any other person, firm, or corporation for the purpose of producing commercial sound records. Artist also agrees that after the expiration of this agreement not to record for anyone else any of the musical selections recorded under this agreement, and that in the event of a breach of this covenant, the company shall be entitled to an injunction to enforce same, in addition to any other remedies available to it at law or equity.”, Legally, you can get the artist to agree not to record a contract or promote a recording for another label for a certain amount of time after your contract ends. You should expect the artist to push back on this, but you can include it in your template:


“Artist warrants not to perform or license or consent to the use by or exploitation of any phonograph record or recording by the artist for another record label, management company, or producer for a period of 12 months subsequent to the expiration or termination of this agreement.”, The artist or the artist’s music company will probably pay you a deposit in order to record the initial tracks. You should identify the amount of the deposit in this section.


For example, you could state, “Artist has paid a deposit to the recording company in the following sum: .”You can also identify the method used (such as wire transfer, certified check, etc.) and where the money was sent (i.e., the name of your bank).

, The artist needs to pay the remainder of the costs for recording before you will begin a recording session. You should explain the details.


For example, you could write: “The artist must pay the balance of the recording contract 72 hours prior to the session being called. The recording date is scheduled for . The total cost of recording the complete project, less the amount of deposit, will be .”, You want to spell out clearly whether the artist can get a refund on their deposit or fees if they need to cancel a recording session. For example, you might write:


“The artist cannot cancel a session without giving the producer, or company representative, written notice at least 10 business days prior to the recording session. If a session is canceled, the deposit is nonrefundable. However, it may be applied to another date.”, To prevent disputes from arising after recording, you should explain who will own the recorded tracks. It is standard for the record label to hold all rights to the music when the artist is a novice. More established artists can negotiate to gain control of the music after a certain amount of time.


You could write, “All sides recorded during the terms of this contract shall be recorded by the artist on the record company’s behalf. All records or discs made therefrom, together with the performances embodied therein, shall from the inception of their creation be entirely the property of the record company in perpetuity, through the territory, free from any claim whatsoever by the artist.”, You should also explain in the contract that you have the sole rights to use the recorded songs throughout the territory you agreed to, as you see fit. With this clause, you are basically telling the artist that you will control distribution, not the artist.


For example, you could include this distribution provision: “The record company shall have the sole and exclusive right to use the sides throughout the territory or any part thereof in any manner it deems fit, including without limitation the sole and exclusive right in perpetuity and throughout the territory to manufacture, advertise, sell, distribute, lease, license, or otherwise use or dispose of the sides.”, The artist will expect a certain percentage of the sale of each CD or digital downloads. You need to include provisions which address how royalties are paid. Be sure to include information about domestic royalties and international royalties.Most recording labels pay a lesser royalty amount on international sales than they do on domestic sales. If the artist has a lawyer, then you should expect to negotiate the royalty rate.To understand what is a standard royalty rate, contact other record labels or meet with an experienced lawyer in the music industry.

, You want to protect yourself from an artist who steals another person’s work but presents it to you as original. In that situation, you could be sued for copyright infringement.


For example, you could include this covenant: “Artist covenants that he/she has the sole right to record such original songs without any restrictions whatsoever. Artist further warrants that he/she has not entered into any written, oral, or other binding agreement of any kind prior to recording such songs on behalf of the record company.”, By agreeing to this provision, the artist agrees not to sue you for any misunderstandings in the agreement. Obviously, including this provision won’t entirely prevent lawsuits. However, it can be helpful to have.


You might write: “Artist agrees and warrants to hold the record company ‘completely and totally harmless’ from lawsuits, and litigation of any kind whatsoever, that might proceed from any misunderstandings spelled out or not spelled out in this agreement.”, You can agree to arbitrate any disputes that arise under this contract. Arbitration is like a trial except it is private. You present your case to an arbitrator instead of a judge. Alternately, you could include a provision that you will mediate any dispute with the help of a mediator.


“If a disagreement does arise, then the parties have agreed in this contract to seek binding arbitration for their differences outside the bounds of a lawsuit and before an arbitration panel made up of people within the music community who understand the legal aspects of each and every facet of this agreement.”, Many young artists have stars in their eyes and imagine that fame and wealth are automatically guaranteed because they have signed a recording contract. You can include some provisions which explain to the artist that the music industry is risky.


For example, you could have the artist promise to the following: “The artist covenants that he/she is not basing a decision to record on any intangible or fraudulent promises, dreams, or incentives given him/her by the producers, company, or management firm. It is the reality of the music business that the artist is taking a chance at recording and may or may not ever be signed to a major label in the future.”
Also, you can have the artist warrant that no one is guaranteed success: “The artist understands and warrants that no one can guarantee ‘superstardom’ in the music industry. Only a small percentage of acts signed to the major labels go on to achieve superstardom.”For extra emphasis, you can set these provisions off in bold type.

, Near the end of the contract, you want to explain how the contract can be terminated and what grounds can trigger termination. Generally, you will want to give yourself the power to terminate the agreement if the artist breaks any provision in the contract.


For example, you could write: “If artist is in material breach of any material term or provision of this agreement, or if the company determines that artist’s ability to perform as a recording artist has become impaired, then in addition to all other rights and remedies available to the company at law or equity, the company shall have the following options: (1) to terminate this agreement at any time, whether or not artist has commenced to cure the default before such termination occurs; (2) to suspend the company’s obligations to render accounting statements or payments to the artist until such time as the artist eliminates the default or condition; and/or (3) require artist to repay to company the amount of any advances not yet recouped.”, This clause states that the contract contains the entirety of your agreement. Any prior agreements are merged (and superseded) by the written agreement. You want this clause so that the artist doesn’t sue and claim that you had a prior oral agreement that isn’t included in the contract.


A sample merger clause might read: “This contract contains the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the matters contained herein. It may not be modified, waived, or supplemented except in a writing signed by all parties.”, If you find yourself in a contract dispute, then the judge will have to interpret the contract using a state’s law. You can decide which state’s law you want to use. Generally, companies pick the law of the state where they are located.


A choice of law provision could read: “This contract shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Tennessee, excluding that State’s choice-of-law principles, and all claims relating to or arising out of the contract, or the breach thereof, whether sounding in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall likewise be governed by the laws of Tennessee, excluding that State’s choice-of-law principles.”, You should clearly lay out each party’s address. Don’t put this information under the signature blocks. Instead, you can insert it before the signatures. Make sure that you have the following information for each party:


name
address
daytime telephone
evening telephone
fax number
email address

, It is common for many different people to sign a recording contract, so you will probably need five signature lines. Just above the lines, include the following: “In witness whereof, all of the following parties have caused their legal signatures to be affixed in agreement this .” You should have a signature line for each of the following people:Record Label Representative
Management Company
Producer
Co-Producer
Artist or Artist’s Music Company Representative

, The contract may be signed in front of a notary public. If you want the contract notarized, then include a notary block. You can find an appropriate block for your state by searching the Internet.

, This is only a basic recording contract. After you have completed a draft, you should show the contract to your lawyer. He or she will look it over and tell you if you need to include anything else. Contracts usually have to be modified according to your particular business needs.


If you don’t have a lawyer, then ask other recording companies who their attorney is and whether they would recommend their attorney. You can then call the lawyer and schedule a consultation. Take your sample contract with you.

, You can negotiate the terms of the contract. Let the artist and the artist’s lawyer (if there is one) look over the contract. They may write comments on the draft and send this draft back to you.Your lawyers may have to talk with each other to negotiate compromises on some issues. Make sure that each side agrees to the entire contract before signing it.

, After everyone has signed the agreement, you should make at least one copy for each person who signed it. Also keep the original in a safe place, such as a safety deposit box.

What are you good at, musically? Want to be a pop singer? It can be a tough road. If you're pretty good at violin, it might be quicker and easier to focus on those skills. Be the pop diva of classical violin.
What are you most passionate about? Do you want to perform, and be the center of attention? Or do you just want to put your head down and play guitar in the background?
Not everyone gets to be a Beyonce or a Justin Timberlake. But the drummers, programmers, and back-up singers are all recording artists too. If you want to work in the music industry as a recording artist, think about other kinds of roles.;
, Whatever your talent, there are lots of ways to specialize and focus. There are big differences between opera singers and jazz singers, for example. Guitar players are an important part of jazz, metal, indie rock, and many different genres of music. To give yourself the best shot, pick one.


What do you like to listen to? Who are your musical heroes? What kind of music do you imagine that you're playing, when you imagine a future as a recording artist?
Also think about who you are and where you come from. How might you market yourself? It might be hard to be a gangster rapper if you're from the suburbs. That environment might give you lots of opportunities to focus on jazz, classical, or indie rock though.

, Once you've discovered your talent and decided on a style you'd like to pursue, it's important to do some research. If you want to be a recording artist, study the other recording artists who perform in your chosen style.


Listen closely to the music like it was your homework. Try to figure out what's good about a particular song, or style that you like. Why is one Rhianna single better than another? What is the difference between grindcore and death metal?
Also look into the stories of the people who play it. What did your favorite guitar player do to get noticed? How did your heroes start? Check out interviews, documentaries, and liner notes as resources.

, Pop stars almost always have teachers and coaches who help them at every step of the way.There are almost no professional musicians who have never received any kind of training or guidance whatsoever.


If you want to be a metal singer, you might think it's unnecessary to hire a vocal coach, and you might be right. But it's still good to find someone that you can talk to and learn from. Find a more experienced metal singer in your town and pick up the tricks of the trade.
Try to stick to contemporary musicians as role-model teachers. Jimi Hendrix might be your guitar hero, and it's great to learn from him as a player. But the music industry works a lot differently than it did in his day. Try to learn the business side from someone who knows it today.

, It's hard to make it as a recording artist, and talent can only take you so far. The more parts of the business that you're familiar with, the better your chances of making it work. Learn to be as good a performer as possible. Learn to produce and record music to make you a well-rounded commodity.Here are some helpful wikiHow articles to help you round out your abilities:

, Being a recording artist doesn't happen to hobbyists. It's not something you do on the weekend, or in your spare time. If you want to be a recording artist professionally, you need to put your head down and practice, several hours a week. Learn fundamental scales and technique, as well as full songs that you're rehearsing.


It's usually better to practice for a short time every day than to practice one day a week for several hours. It's much easier to build muscle memory and technique this way.If you play a classical instrument or sing, consider joining a school band, orchestra, or choir. These provide further instruction and opportunities. Playing and singing at church is also a common way of getting started.

, If you want to be a singer, you'll need some musicians to play with. If you want to be a rapper, you'll need a beat-maker and producer to collaborate with. Even if you want to be a solo guitar player, you'll need to meet people to play shows with and to network.


Start going to shows in your town and introducing yourself. Meet people as much as you can, and tell them you're a musician.
Advertise on Craigslist, or other local online venues. Find a message board for local musicians, or put up flyers in the record store or music store, old-school style.

, As you meet people, you may find that nobody's interested in playing the exact kind of music that you want to play. That can be ok. Try out different styles, to make you a more well-rounded player. This can be a great way to get your foot in the door and start playing. Worry about playing exactly what you want later.


If you're a guitar player, it'll be a lot easier to make it as a recording artist if you can play lots of different styles. You'll always have a gig if you can switch between playing straight-up country twang one day and playing convincing metal riffs the next.
Even if you're not sure you can play something, if you meet some people who are talented and interested in your abilities, give it a shot for a while. You might end up liking it.

, Once you've met people to play with and have some tunes together, it's a good idea to play them for people to get feedback. Ask some music fans to watch you perform and get their honest feedback and criticism. Then Try to improve your sound and continue developing as an artist.


Most of the time, hip-hop and electronic music will be recorded at home before playing live shows. Most rock bands will probably play live before doing any kind of recording. Play your music however works best.
Start small, if you're going to play live. Lots of coffee shops and bars will offer open-mic nights, which are designed to give first-timers a crack at the stage. Almost everyone at an open-mic will be inexperienced, so it's an easy and understanding audience.

, If you want to be a recording artist, it's good to get some experience recording music yourself and learning how to share your songs. Ableton, GarageBand, Fruity Loops and other types of cheap software are perfectly good for getting started.


As you grow, you might want to invest in more complex (and expensive) recording software, including ProTools and Logic. These will give you more professional products for your sound.
You don't necessarily need expensive gear to sound good. Even just recording a few acoustic songs on your built-in computer mic or your cellphone can sound good enough with a little reverb in GarageBand. Use what you've got and make it a part of your sound.

, Chief Keef and A$AP Rocky got huge record deals based on the strength of a few YouTube clips. For some kinds of music, this should be one of the first steps. Electronic music, hip-hop, and vocal pop music will have an easier time getting recognized online than at a club or bar. Instead of worrying about playing ""gigs"" in your town, take it straight to the Internet. You're more likely to get noticed there.


Start separate social networking pages for yourself as an artist, or for your group. Invite all of your own followers to follow that page for updates about gigs, new recordings, and other information about your music career.
Bandcamp, Soundcloud, DatPiff, and BAND are all excellent choices that allow you to share high-quality sound files of your music and follow other bands, labels, and accounts for free.

, As you rehearse, record, and share your music online, it's important to connect with fans in a live setting as well, for most styles of music. Try to grow your fanbase by playing regular gigs and organizing a tour when it's financially possible.


Keep it local at first. Find a few local venues where you'll be able to play regular shows, and Try to get in tight with the management. Be reliable, consistent, and professional, and bring a crowd? They'll ask you back.

Try and book a short tour when you're first starting out. World tours with shows in Iceland and Japan probably aren't feasible for your first tours. Keep it to the tri-state area, no more than a week or two at most.

, A cool looking band t-shirt, a few trendy patches, and other music-related merchandise is like free advertising for your music career. Every time someone wears the t-shirt of your band, there's the possibility that a few more people might get interested and check them out.


Merchandise is also an excellent way to make money and sustain a band, or to make a little money for recording and other costs associated with a solo career. If you've got cool-looking stuff to sell, you can make quite a bit of money at a single gig between merch, ticket sales, and guaranteed fees from the venue.

, If you live in a small town, it's going to be tough to get noticed by a wider fan-base, whatever kind of music you play. Shows at the coffee shop around the corner are a great start. But think about whether or not it would benefit your music career by moving to a bigger city where there will be more opportunities.


New York and Los Angeles are definitely places to get noticed, but it can be hard to crack into such a big scene. Consider moving to a more local big city first. Chicago or Minneapolis are good bets in the Midwest. Providence or Philadelphia are music towns on the East Coast. Nashville or Austin represent the South, and Portland or Seattle hold it down on the West Coast.

, One excellent shortcut to exposure is to get yourself on television. Even if you don't win, an appearance can be huge exposure. This can give talented people like you important industry contacts. Find those 15 minutes of fame and use them to further your ambitions.


Talent-based performance shows like American Idol, X-Factor, The Voice, or others will often be a good way to get exposure to a mainstream audience as a potential recording artist. It's a good way to see if you have what it takes.
MTV and other music-programs will sometimes host shows searching for the ""next big star"" of some particular style.

, If you want to get signed to a label, you need to have a high-quality demo recording of your music to share. Normally, the best way to do this is online, so it's helpful to update those old Bandcamp and Soundcloud accounts to represent your best-sounding recordings of your highest-quality material.


Most good demos are no more than a song or two. Record your hits, your absolute best material. No filler.
Remember: Labels don't sign artists because they hope they'll record great music one day. They sign talent who already records great music, then provide that artist with a push that they hope to profit from.

, Press packages are used to accompany demo tapes. The press package should explain who you are, what you do, and where you come from in a concise way. A basic press package should involve the following items:


A short bio, explaining who you are
Photos
Newspaper write-ups
Interviews
Reviews
Quotes or endorsements from other artists

, The quality of your music is the most important part of a career in the music industry. But, talent won't take you all the way. To be successful, having a look that matches your sound is usually an important consideration in marketing a particular artist.Use your sound to influence your look, and vice versa. If you look like a burly woodsman, it might be a good idea to emphasize the gruffer, more folk-like elements of your sound. If you're a clean-cut city-dweller, on the other hand, it might be a good idea to get some dirt under your fingernails and grow a beard if you want to be in a successful bluegrass band.

, Who put out your favorite artists' records? Where did they get their start? Who do you know at particular labels that might be willing to give your band a shot at a recording? Pick a few labels you think you might have a shot with and send them their A and R department your demo and press pack.


Major labels like Warner Brothers, Virgin, and Sony BMG have a lot of money to throw around at established acts, but they typically only look at groups that have big potential to make money. Many of the acts will have multiple albums or industry success under their belts already.
Independent labels might have less money, but are more willing to give you control over your product. There's typically more freedom with an indie label.
Some people think the more labels you send you material out to, the better chance you'll have of getting signed. It's important to be familiar with the labels you're contacting. Never engage in a carpet-bombing campaign. If you're sending your demo of folk tunes to metal labels, you're wasting everyone's time., An alternative way of getting noticed and potentially signed by a record label is to Try to find out about industry showcases and festivals, or travel to one for a gig. You can typically apply to showcases by submitting materials, and then play and network when you're there. For many acts, this is the best way to get actual face-time with talent scouts.South by Southwest in Austin, TX is one of the best places for up-start DIY acts to get noticed by the music industry, but any type of music festival is huge exposure for a band. Even if the stage you play on is the smallest one, it's great to be able to say that your name was on the bill with other big acts.

, Increasingly, very popular acts are going independent. If you can sell your music directly to your fans with nobody in the middle, why mess around with a record label at all? Consider selling your own music online and covering the fees associated with it yourself.


Record contracts include guarantees and advances, which don't require you to sell a lot. If you've got a single you know will sell a million copies, you stand to make a lot of money from iTunes alone, but if you're not sure you can deliver, a contract offers you more security.

, As you gain exposure and access to the recording industry, it can get pretty complicated to handle on your own. To make sure you don't get locked into any deals that are unfavorable, it's usually smart business to hire a manager that will handle the business side of your career, and possibly an agent to help you handle the marketing and public relations side of your career.

Share it!",How to Become an Electronic Music Producer," There is a lot of variety in electronic music, and many different genres and styles to choose from. Be it house, trap, ambient or dubstep, it’s up to you whatever sound you are going for. It’s a good idea to listen to a lot of electronic music before you make up your mind, so that you know what sort of music gets you the most excited, or you understand the most.


Alternatively, you can ignore genres completely and make something new and exciting, however this is very difficult and is best done with prior experience producing other genres.;
, If you find yourself focussing on one genre in particular, this will help you to know what you are going to write when you first start. Do some research on artists relevant to your chosen genre by listening to songs, reading interviews/article and reading reviews. This will help you to know what inspires them to write songs, how they go about the process and how they began producing electronic music.


Some examples could be for Skrillex, Flux Pavilion, and Barely Alive for dubstep; for house Deadmau5, Disclosure, Avicii and for trap Diplo, Jack Ü, DJ Snake etc.

, A DAW is the fundamental piece of software used to arrange, sequence and compose songs, as well as contain and connect all the plugins (instruments/effects) used to create your songs. Do some research into the pros and cons of different DAWs.


If you are stuck deciding, research what DAWs your favourite artists use and which DAWs are most popular with your chosen genre. Examples of popular DAWs include: Cubase, Ableton Live, Logic Pro (OSX only) and FL Studio (Windows only).

, A plugin (sometimes referred to as a VST as this is a common format) is a software instrument or effect you use in conjunction with a DAW to create, edit and manipulate sound. You may need to invest in plugins such as synthesisers, mixing/mastering effects and samplers.


Many plugins are not essential, but can help you to create interesting sounds to give your songs an interesting and unique edge. Also, many DAWs come with their own plugins, so you may not need to purchase any of your own.

, You need to make sure your computer has good enough specs and capabilities to handle the processing you will need to make your music. Most producers don’t need a massively powerful computer, but it depends on the sort of techniques and sounds you want to produce. To begin with, your processing will most likely only be basic, so a high end computer is not essential from the get-go.

, Aside from just a computer, you will need to have some sort of hardware with which to monitor and listen to what it is you are creating. Getting the best sound quality is important to having a professional and polished sound. This means you should be willing to spend considerably more money on this than you would for general listen to music. For this you will either need headphones or studio monitors (speakers).


Many people prefer monitors and will claim they allow for better clarity and accuracy, but good headphones are generally cheaper than good monitors. Do some research before you buy to see the pros and cons of each. Popular brands of monitors include KRK, Yamaha and M-Audio. Popular brands of headphones include Sennheiser, Audio-Technica and AKG.

, This can include hardware that will make producing music easier, but is not necessarily essential to making music. Non-essential items of hardware (for electronic music) could include: audio interfaces, microphones, MIDI controllers/keyboards and hardware synthesisers/processors.


Many people claim the sound generated from hardware synthesisers is superior to any software plugins, but this is a matter of taste, and the average listener won’t notice (plus hardware synthesisers can be very expensive).

, The most essential step to effective music production is knowing how to get the most out of your software, and this is especially true for your DAW. Learning to use a DAW can seem very daunting for first-time producers and can sometimes put people off making music all together. However, once you can use your DAW effectively, making music becomes so much easier.


Make sure to thoroughly read the manual for your DAW. This will help you to come to grips with the official functions and uses of different aspects of your DAW, as well ways of using your software according to the people that designed it.
Watch tutorials on using your DAW on YouTube. YouTube can be an invaluable resource when it comes to learning music production, as there are many high quality tutorials available for free, for varying levels of expertise.

, Learning to use your plugins, particularly for synthesis, can be one of the most daunting tasks of learning to produce music. This is especially true as many plugins pride themselves on having a unique and intuitive way of working. This will require a similar approach to learning to use a DAW. Once again, read the manual and make use of tutorials on YouTube. Also, most plugins come with a wide range of presets that will allow you to make good music without being overwhelmed with an array of knobs and switches.

, Learning to use hardware is generally much easier than software, as long as you don’t have anything too complex such as synthesisers. Things such as connecting up MIDI keyboards and audio interfaces are usually fairly easy to figure out.


The only problem you may run into when setting up hardware is positioning studio monitors, as this will have a strong impact on the sound that they produce. A general rule is to have them pointing directly toward your ears at head height. Also try to position the monitors so that they form an equilateral triangle with your head.

, This links to the first part of the article, and if you already have a good plan of where you want to go this should be fairly easy. Start off by listening to lots of electronic music. This doesn't necessarily have to be from your chosen genre, as it can be good to bring in ideas and influences from other genres as well. If you are struggling, try writing down features from songs that you really like and implementing them into your own track

, This part may seem boring, but having a basic understanding of music theory will massively help you in writing catchy songs and doing it quickly and easily. Just a small amount of knowledge on melody and chords can really help you write a decent tune. If you struggle with composing melodies, try to replicate melodies from popular songs as accurately as you can in your DAW, as this will help you to understand how melodies are constructed.

, Sometimes when you are fed up of all this learning and preparation, the best thing is to just have a go. Remember, your first song will most likely be terrible, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't be proud of it. Everyone's first song will sound amateur, and even the most professional producers will have been at this stage at some point, just keep producing songs and improving. Getting to a professional standard can take years.

, Once you have made your masterpiece, show it off to the world. Upload it to the internet, put it on YouTube, Soundcloud and share it with your friends. Be proud of what you have done and don't worry if you think people won't like it, you should be proud that you made a song all by yourself!

Take any melody you like, or two part composition you like.,
Eliminate every repetition.,
Reduce every harpeggio (obvious such) to a chord.,
Eliminate every note in top voice which only serves to lead between two notes.,
Eliminate every note in top voice which juts out below or above a note and then gets back to it.,
Understand how the bass progression should work.,
Reduce to its parts any chord not accounted for by bass progression as described above if:

a) it is a dominant to it (D G reducing to G, Dm G reducing to G, Am Dm reducing to Dm ...),
b) it is a sequence of subdominant or double dominant and dominant to it (C D G reducing to G, A Dm G reducing to G), or,
c) either bass or top voice includes a note according to 4 or 5 (between two different notes if leading between them, between two repeats of same note if a neighbour to them) which is integral to the chord which can otherwise not be explained.,
Apply above to many different melodies and pieces (some may involve also repeating parts over other octave registers or extending voices theoretically between top voice and bass to above theoretical top voice, but those are more complicated pieces of Classical Music, generally).,Start out with a top voice descent as described above, and fit it with a bass progression, also covered above.,Add repetitions, filling out of voices between bass and top voice, notes that lead between notes, notes that lead from and back to a note, chords that depend on such notes, after taste.,Add more, until you have what you consider a sound melody.",How to Compose by Schenkerian Synthesis," Write it down on music sheets and start analysing.
, Whether four bars are repeated or one note is repeated once or twice in a bar, reduce to one example., So, if you see a sequence of C E G, this is reduced to simultaneous chord, with G as top note.,

One exception: at the end of the analysis, you should have a falling sequence which starts a fifth or a third, possibly an octave, above the ending tonic note. This sequence will have 1 or 3 notes leading on down (if starting third or fifth above tonic), or two parts, octave, dominant, tonic, with first part 8 to 5 having leading notes 7, 6, and second part 5 to 1 having leading notes 4, 3, 2. But as long as you are not ready to reduce to this, any note coming between a lower and a higher note or between a higher or a lower one is eliminated. Sometimes this will give you an harpeggio, which can then be further reduced, according to step 3.

, C D C > C. And C B C > C. Even C B D C and C D B C are reduced to C. This is done even if the note involves chords of its own. See the parts on chords and bass., This is not per se a step, but a description of how next step should look when finished. Bass should end on a note an octave lower than tonic of end note in top voice. Before that it should make a bass progression, parts of which may obviously be repeated in the full version of whatever you are analysing. The basic bass progression should go from tonic over another chord to dominant (C D G, C E G, C F G) and then not over another chord back from dominant to tonic (G C). Steps can be inverted so that dominant is lower than tonic. Transition can then be directly down only (C B A G), or down to D or F before going back up to a lower G (C A F G, C A F D G).,
Basic bass progression should on tonic and dominant not include inversions of chords, but an inverted chord is usually one that can be eliminated in this step.
The basic bass progression can be identified not just by how it looks, but also by how it fits with basic descent in top voice. If top voice descends E, D, C, the bass C that starts will fit with E, the dominant G will fit with D, the ending C will fit with the ending C. The note in bass leading up to G (D, E or F) will fit with one of E or D. The top E can even be prolonged (!) so that it corresponds to start of bass G. If top voice descends an octave, there are two bass progressions. If top voice descends a fifth, there is a choice with either one or two. The above also applies if the melody is in minor.

Realize that lead synthesis patterns in trance music can be just as important as lead guitar riffs in rock music.,Get a sound generator, basically any software or hardware synthesis that includes a sequencer will do (to generate a synthesis pattern).,Set the tempo to 148 beats per minute (BPM) or something you find more entrancing.,
Create an 8-note pattern pivoting around one note using the sequencer.,Play back the pattern as a loop.,
Cut a few notes just to make it interesting - say 4 notes - out of the pattern.,
Choose from the number of different paths you can take.,Set your sequencer quantization to 16th-notes.,
Copy your pattern and paste it one octave above on the next step of the 16th-notes.,Add 32 notes to your pattern and adjust the lengths of the notes.,
Make the rhythmically important notes very short, and make sure the melodic notes are longer.",How to Produce Those Tricky Lead Synth Patterns Heard in Trance Music," ""Lead"" simply means that the pattern stands out in front of other elements of the music (cf. lead singer, lead guitar).
,,,


For example: c c c d c c c eb c c c g

,,


From the example above (X marks the cut): c X c c d c c X eb X c X g

,

Instant trance: Add a cross delay and adjust feedback and delay time after your liking.

If you set the tempo to 148 BPM try a delay time of 303ms or offset two delays a couple of hundred ms or adjust it to your liking.
If your sequencer is capable of automation be sure to record movements or edits for each note: cutoffs, (filter-sweep that goes swoosh), resonance (the faster the bubblier), and why not make the pattern beat out another rhythm by assigning accents to some of the notes?
If it does not sound right, turn it off for now (always try the default settings first).



,,


Using the pattern in the example it would look something like this: (in 16th-notes): c1 c2 X X c1 c2 c1 c2 d1 d2.

,, In the example, shorten all the Cs to 128th notes. A similar effect can be achieved by creating a 32nd-note pattern and adding an automated gate or using a second pattern and a side-chain compressor."

Insert another flash drive and repeat.,
Get on a pair of CDJs or XDJ set up, and run through your set.,
Get to the venue early to plug in your flash drive.,
Throw down a killer set.",How to Analyze and Cue Tracks in Rekordbox," It is important that you remember to drag every track that you plan on playing into the software, because unlike Serato, you can not properly play tracks that have not been previously analyzed.;
, This is also an important part of staying organized while you are playing.

, Another organization technique that will really add to the fluidity of your set. Instead of having to scroll through hundreds of tracks trying to find the song you want to play next, plan your set beforehand and get all of the tracks in order. You won't regret it.

, This is very important, because if your beat grids don't follow the beat of the song, it will make beat-matching very difficult.

, The same technique won't work for everyone. For example, you might set A-cue at the beginning of the track, B-cue 16 bars from the drop of the track, C-cue 8 bars from the drop, and D-cue 8 bars from where you want to mix the track in., This will help you avoid an occasion where you've loaded a track expecting it to be cued and it wasn't. There will be a small graphic beside each track telling you whether it has been cued or not.

,,, Make sure that you see it loading onto the flash drive on the bottom Rekordbox, and make sure you don't remove the flash drive until Rekordbox has finished exporting your crate.

, It is easy for files to become corrupted, and sometimes crates might not export in their entirety. It is also possible to experience issues with network connectors on CDJs where it won't load your tracks through all the devices. In that case you would need a flash drive to plug into each CDJ you planned on using. Play it safe, and be prepared for anything.

, Flagship hardware can be very pricey so ask around the DJ community, make friends, and share equipment with others. The DJ community is generally a pretty cool bunch so be outgoing, and reach out to people so you never have an issue with finding the right equipment to practice on.

, Make sure everything is set to go. Just get there early and be prepared., Make sure to have fun, and if you make a mistake keep playing. Chances are the crowd didn't even notice."

Get a musical instrument you know how to play.,
If you know how to read music, grab the sheet music.,
Listen to the song.,
Count the beat slowly in 4/4 time.,
Play G-G-C, holding the C. The song starts with one beat's worth of pick up notes: a dotted eighth note G and a sixteenth note G. These are followed by a dotted quarter note C above them held for three beats.,
Play G-C-E, holding the E. On the fourth beat of the first measure, the same rhythmic pattern as before repeats, but with different notes.,
Play G-C-E three times, holding the last E. Next, the G-C-E pattern from above repeats several times, but with different rhythms.,
Play C-E-G (ascending), then E-C-G (descending), holding the last G. On the fourth beat of the fourth measure, the song's short climax begins.,
Play G-G-C, holding the C. To end the song, play the pattern you used at the very beginning.,
Hold the long notes with fermatas over them.,
Grow in intensity through the song, peaking at the high G note.,
Let the final note slowly ""die"".,
Play ""loose"" with the rhythms for emotional effect.",How to Play Taps," ""Taps"" can be played on virtually any instrument. As long as you can play a complete C major scale from one G note to the G an octave above it, you can play the tune.


However, traditionally (and at most military occasions today), ""Taps"" is played on trumpet or bugle.
;
, Being able to read sheet music makes playing ""Taps"" much easier, since the music to the tune is public domain and freely available online. One good source for the sheet music is at the official site for U.S. Army bands.Note that the sheet music above uses the treble clef. If you can only read music that is written in bass clef, you will need to transpose the notes in the song (or just identify each note individually.) See Our article on the subject for a brief guide.
Note also that there is an alternate version of ""Taps"" for bass clef instruments that uses the notes of the Bb major triad (F, Bb, D, and F again.)

, If you're not familiar with the song already, it's a smart idea to listen to a recording of ""Taps"" before you start playing. Though the song uses only four different notes and 24 notes in total, listening to the song being played can help you get a sense for the rhythms used in the song and, more importantly, the dynamics and emotional timbres used for it. The site linked above has a good-quality recording of ""Taps"" played by a solo trumpet.

, ""Taps"" is almost always written in common (4/4) time and the key of C. A slow, steady tempo (e.g., quarter note = 50 beats per minute) that's appropriate for the song's solemn tone is generally used.A metronome can be useful for practice, if you have one.


4/4 time essentially means that there will be four beats per measure and that each beat will be equal to one quarter note. Start mentally counting, ""one, two, three, four"" as you read the music, keeping your tempo as steady as possible.

,


The starting G is the first G above middle C on most versions of the sheet music, but it's possible to play ""Taps"" in any G-to-G octave that's comfortable for you.
Note the pickup notes — this means that the song actually starts on beat four, rather than beat one.

, First, play a dotted eighth note G, then a quick sixteenth note C, then hit the E above these notes and hold it for three beats into the second measure.

, On the fourth beat of the second measure, play a dotted eighth note G, a sixteenth note C, and a quarter note E (held only for a single beat. Play this G-C-E (quarter note) pattern again. Finally, play the same G-C-E pattern, only hold the E (which is now a dotted quarter note) for three beats instead of just one.

, This section is different than the patterns you played before. Play a dotted eighth note C, then a sixteenth note E above it, then hit a half note G above that and hold it for two beats. Play descending E and C quarter notes after the high G on beats three and four of the fifth measure. End by playing a dotted quarter note low G on the first beat of the sixth measure and holding it for three beats.


Note that the high G in this measure is exactly one octave above the low G you've been using for the rest of the song.

, Play a dotted eighth note (low) G, a sixteenth note G, and a dotted quarter note C, holding the last note for three beats.


Congratulations — you've just played ""Taps.""

, Playing the notes of taps exactly as they are written on the page is one thing, but playing them with feeling is another entirely. To do this, you'll need to pay attention to the symbols on the page besides the notes as well. For example, on the song's sheet music, almost every dotted quarter note is marked with a symbol that looks like a downward crescent over a dot (or a small eye.) This is called a fermata symbol and it means to hold the note somewhat longer than normal. Exactly how long you hold the note is up to you. Usually, to keep the song's solemn and dignified tone, it's best to play these notes for only a few extra beats, but feel free to play around with the fermata notes as you practice to find what sounds best.


The fermata notes in the song are most of the dotted quarter notes: the C at the start of the first measure, the E at the start of the second, the E at the start of the fourth, and the C at the end of the song. Note that the low G at the start of the sixth measure doesn't have a fermata — if it sounds good to you, you can usually still get away with extending this note.

, Notice the markings below the staff on the sheet music that look like long, skinny < and > symbols. These signal you to perform crescendos and diminuendos. This basically means that you should start the song at a medium volume (signified by the mf mezzoforte symbol at the start), then get louder very gradually until you reach the climactic high G, which should be fairly loud (signified by the ff fortissimo symbol underneath it.) After this, decrease in volume to a moderately loud level until the end of the song.


Don't go overboard with the loudest notes. You want to play strongly and powerfully, but if you play loud enough to hurt your listeners' ears, you'll diminish the seriousness of the song. In addition, on most instruments, extra-loud notes are hard to control tonally — you do not want to miss a note during the climax of the song.

, Notice the morendo under the final note on the sheet music. This is Italian for ""dying"" and it means exactly what it sounds like.When you play the final note, hold it longer than you normally would and let its volume gradually decrease as if it is ""dying away."" When you finish playing the note, it should be very quiet — as if you're almost playing nothing at all.


The contrast between the climactic high G and the final dying C note can be very powerful if done correctly. The effect this creates is one of powerful emotion giving way to gentle, almost tragic resignation. The special significance of this part of the song at funerals is obvious.

, ""Taps"" is often played as a chorale — that is, a slow, rhythmically simple song where the beauty of the tones is more important than the rhythms being played. This means that you can be a little creative when it comes to rhythm and tempo. As long as the relative lengths of the notes are preserved, don't be afraid to make individual notes longer or shorter than the music says if it gives the piece more emotional power.


For example, one change you might make is to slightly slow down the tempo during the climax of the song to give the notes a ""bigger"", more powerful effect. There are many more changes you may want to make like this. The exact changes you make are up to you!
In addition, it's worth remembering that since you'll almost always be playing taps solo, you don't need to worry about matching tempo with other players.

Gather your tools and materials.,
Pick somewhere quiet to practice.,
Set a goal.,
Create a practice schedule and stick to it.,
Warm up first.,
Work towards your goal.,
Use a practice notebook.,
Take notes in your practice book.,
Play something fun and easy at the end.,
Play smarter.,
Use technology to your advantage.,
Focus on your problem areas.,
Read through the music without your instrument.,
Make tasks harder by physically challenging yourself.,
Practice at productive times of day.,
Practice only for as long as you can focus.",How to Practice an Instrument Effectively," Before you start practicing, make sure you have your sheet music, your music stand, your instrument, as well as a timer, a tuner, a metronome, and any other helpful tools you may need. Also keep a pencil, a pencil sharpener, and a clean eraser nearby.By gathering these items before you start working, you’ll keep yourself from having to break concentration to find them in the middle of practicing.
, By designating a certain separate room or area as your practice space, you can eliminate distractions and also prepare yourself mentally for mindful work.Try practicing in a room of your house that people spend less time in, such as the formal dining room. Any area like this will keep you away from distractions such as a conversation between family members in the kitchen or a TV that’s on in the living room.

, It’s better to have something to work towards than to just start playing music without intention. Think about what you’d really like to accomplish during each practice session and focus on that goal throughout it.

For instance, you might be really close to mastering a piece but still have a couple problem spots. Consider aiming to play the piece through perfectly one time during the practice session.
If, for example, you want to improve the sound of your guitar, consider setting a goal to achieve a better sound by experimenting with different hand positionings.
If you aren’t sure how to set your goals, ask you music teacher what you need to work on at the end of lessons and/or class. Write this down and refer back to it when you practice on your own., The amount you should practice depends on what your skill level is, how old you are, and how dedicated you are to progressing quickly. If you want to advance, you should play your instrument 6 days a week, whether that’s for 15 minutes or 2 hours each day. Pick consistent times and days that work best for you and always practice when you’re scheduled to.If you want to practice for 6 hours a week, you might schedule practice time from 3:00pm to 4:00pm every Sunday-Friday.

, Once you have everything set up and ready, spend about 5-10 minutes working on scales and doing other warm-up activities. You can also do some breathing and stretching exercises at this time., After you’ve warmed up, dive right into accomplishing your goal. Take your time and stay focused.This is the most important part of the practice session and should take the most amount of time, whether that means 20 minutes or an hour.

, Even if you’ve played a piece a lot, it’s better to read what you’re playing and not rely on your memory. By always using your practice book, you can use the mental effort it takes to remember the notes on something else, such as tone quality or tempo., As you work through pieces, use your pencil to highlight problem areas and give yourself reminders. These little bits of information should help you to play the piece better and with more awareness.Write down things that may help you remember best practices, such as ""Take a short breath"" or ""add a crescendo.""

, Once you’ve reached your goal, spend the last 10-15 minutes or so playing something that you really enjoy playing and/or have played a lot.This serves as a cool down, and allows you to finish the session on a positive note.

, When you’re playing a challenging piece, don’t just play it all the way through over and over and over again while continuously making errors. This is a waste of time. Instead, take a step back and identify and analyze the problem. Then, brainstorm solutions, experiment with them, and implement the best one.

For example, if a note comes out flat each time you play it on your trumpet, first identify what you want it to sound like. Then, try to think about the different possible causes of the sour note. Slightly adjust your fingering and your mouth until you discover an adjustment that allows you to play the note properly., There are several free or inexpensive apps that act as timers, metronomes, tuners, and more. Consider using these when you’re on the go so that you don’t have to tote around extra tools and materials.Also, check out different lessons and tutorials on sites like Youtube that can help you solve any specific issues you’re having without paying for a lesson., It’s not always necessary to start at the beginning and play a piece through to the end over and over. If you’re having a problem with a couple measures in the middle of the piece, focus more on that section. This will save you a lot of time and allow you to make more progress., When you aren’t practicing and you have a couple minutes of down time, take out your music or pull it up on your phone and just carefully read through it a few times to familiarize yourself with it more.You can read through your music while you’re riding in the car to get to school or waiting in a long line at the post office.

, Add a physical component to your practicing that you don’t normally have to deal with. By making a challenging addition to practicing your instrument, you’ll make playing normally feel easier.

For example, try to play your instrument while standing on one leg., Everyone has more energy at certain times of the day than at others. Pay attention to what time of day you seem to be the most awake, focused, energetic, and clear-headed. Try to practice your instrument during these times., In order to make progress during a practice section, you have to be completely focused and mindful. This might mean practicing for just 10 minutes when you’re younger and then working up to 45 minutes or an hour once you’re older and have developed better concentration skills.If you can only keep your attention on something for 15 minutes at a time, then play for 15 minutes, put down your instrument and take a break for a couple minutes, and then play for another 15 minutes.

Buy, borrow an instrument that you enjoy playing or would like to play.,
There are several ways to learn how to play this music.

,
If you are a vocalist, simply sing along by ear.,
If you're a guitarist/bassist, search for tablature on sites like ultimateguitar.com, x-guitar.com, etc.,
Find other people who like metal, and get to know them.,
If you're a drummer, play by ear.,
Take breaks when practicing, for metal can be quite exhausting if you're not used to playing for long extensions of time.,
Try to practice daily, for at least an hour.,
Form a band if you know enough people who are into metal like you are.",How to Play Heavy Metal," Preferably drums, guitar, mic, or even a keyboard.;
,, If it is a form of extreme metal, or isn't but includes some sort of growling, screaming, squealing, gargling, screeching, or inhaling, I will offer information on extreme vocals later in the guide. Also, visit darklyrics.com to get the lyrics laid out quickly and clearly to get the rhythmical sequencing of your syllables right. Don't be like the guy in Obituary who sang the vocals and then wrote the lyrics.

, You can also play by ear as the great Chuck Schuldiner did. To play by ear, simply turn your music on a stereo or computer, iHome etc, and play along. Make sure you know what tuning the group is in before following along. After enough repetition, you will learn patterns and techniques that many metal bands follow when composing songs. Soon you will be writing your own skull crushing riffs with a little blend of yourself and your influences.

, They're pretty cool, really! If you hang around with a lot of like minded people who have a passion for music, you yourself will feel more motivated to continue routine practices in all kinds of music.

, It is a lot of fun, and can also be a good workout if you're not in shape. Learn the different patterns and sequences that metal drummers use to fill the space in the guitar driven songs. A good way to find the beat in an unusual tempo, is by finding where the snare is played. If you can match this up right, you will have an easier time adding the other percussive elements to the drum pattern. Don't be mechanical, hit that splash often, use the ride, and buy a china!

, After a while, you're body will get used to the speed and effort and you will become much less fatigued during play.

, If you're passionate, you'll practice longer sessions without thinking about it. If you have no passion, don't play music, because you'll end up sounding mechanical and boring.

, If you get good enough, you could show them how to play and make them your student. Teaching others will also teach you much about proper technique and understanding the genre

If you are learning to play the piano, the chances are that you learn to read the right hand music (treble clef) quite quickly, but then struggle with the left hand music (bass clef).,
The point is that the black lines are GBDF in both hands (and the red ones ACE).,
Another problem that arises later on is reading notes on ledger lines - the short lines above the treble clef or below the bass clef.",How to Read Music Easily By Combining Bass and Treble Clefs1," What if the music for the two hands were the same?! This can be arranged quite simply. What you do is doctor your pupils' music with a red biro going over the bottom (E) line in the treble clef and on the top (A) line in the bass clef, and adding a red line for middle C, as shown in Diagram One.;
, I've found that most pupils soon learn to read both right hand and left hand. You have to be careful of course to play in the right octave; the G line in the left hand is not for the G just below middle C, but the next one down. What of the spaces? You may find your own way of learning these, but the easiest way is probably to read the note on the next line.

, The same trick can be used here: the first three ACE can be coloured red and then go back to black. So, for example the note on the 4th ledger line in the right hand is obviously G, and the not on the 3rd in the left hand is A.

"
"
If someone takes up this idea to the extent of publishing music with red and black lines, it may occur to them that the logical conclusion is to dispense with clefs!",How to Read Music Easily By Combining Bass and Treble Clefs2, But we would still need some indication as to which octave we were in. If this happened we'd be returning to the Middle Ages! At one time they used a clef-less stave with coloured lines to pin-point important notes.
"
They have to cope with treble and bass clefs.",How to Read Music Easily By Combining Bass and Treble Clefs3," They may find my ideas given above for pianists helpful, especially if they do as tenors in my choir do - transfer their music onto a piano and record that. A nasty problem occurs if a piece switches between clefs. You must realise that the music in the treble clef is written an octave higher than it is sung, so the G on the first black line must be played and sung as the G below middle C. Other notes must be lowered similarly. From experience; tenors think they are actually singing in the treble clef, so may prefer to raise the notes in the bass clef by an octave.

",How to Play Experimental Music," Just grab some old drumsticks and head to your garage. Don't have any drum sticks? Pencils, dowels, anything will work for now, but it is a good idea to pick up some cheap drumsticks at a local music store. In the garage, jam out. Figure out how different things sound. Just have fun, and change the beat around. Play with friends, get an awesome rhythm going. Note: your sticks will break, so don't use anything nice.;
, What if I attached snare drums to a piano? I'm serious, I bet it would sound awesome.

, Random stuff. Cymbals and stretched out wire work nicely.

, By different sizes and pitches and the stretch them out on a frame of wood. You may need to make a resonator box in order to hear anything. Also try adding hammers (not the kind you build a house with, the piano kind.) that strike the strings With a little work and improvisation, you can make some really, really awesome sounds. Also, while looking through the music supplies, look for new ideas, and ask the attendant if you don't know about some things. Music store employees always know what they are talking about.

, Experiment with sounds on the computer, and get/make a MIDI controller so you can trigger the sounds remotely. Get creative with Computer Music technology. You can by little acoustic drum triggers that they use for writing drum music, attach them to anything, and hook them up to a digital drum brain. Hook that up to your computer/MIDI sequencer, and you have yourself a cheap digital drum, that can play anything. Get even more creative, devise a device that turns on and off radios that are set to different static frequencies. That's sure to sound cool. Also, play with old guitar/bass amplifiers and old synthesizers. Research circuit bending on the Internet and with a little electronics knowledge you can modify synthesizers and other circuits to sound funkier than they already are. Do what ever floats your boat, just not on new, expensive stuff.

, Our band calls ours the Gehttolyn. Use mic stands, drum stands, wood scraps, etc. to make a sweet console. Here are some instrument ideas to start you off: multiple balloons stretched tightly over a coffee can, CDs make a good cowbell, speaker grilles, sheet metal, tile pieces, flower pots, soda bottles of all types, cans, PVC pipe is awesome, wood blocks can be really good sounding.

, But try playing them differently. Look at a guitar like you never have seen one before. Say to yourself ""What is that?"" Play it weirdly.

First, play the chord tones of a chord- say, C Major seventh.,
Now, extend this chord by ""dropping"", or omitting, the root and instead playing the ninth, or major second.

,, This is often closest to middle C, as it doesn't sound muddy or indistinct.

, For example, dominant sevenths and minor sevenths.

, Therefore, try many inversions of the chords, and try to stay as close to middle C as possible.

, Play them so much that you respond instantaneously to any changes put in front of you!

Learn the sections.",How to Play Blitzkrieg Bop by the Ramones on the Guitar4,",,, This song is very basic and uses down strums only. After learning all of the four basic power chords, you have to learn the sections. Blitzkrieg Bop only has two sections, a verse and a chorus. Listen to the song to see how the music changes during these parts.


The verse. The verse is played by down strumming the first power chord eight times, switching and playing the second power chord three times then sliding up to play the fourth power chord five times. Repeat this pattern three times. On the fourth time, you play the pattern slightly differently. You down strum the first power chord four times, switch to the second power chord and hit it four times and then switch back to the first power chord and hit it eight times. You should start to hear the verse. Make small adjustments to the timing if necessary.
The chorus. The chorus is played by down strumming the fourth power chord sixteen times then sliding down to the first power chord (two frets down) and hitting it eight times. Switch to the second power chord and hit it three times then switch back to the first power chord and hit it five times. On the second time round, hit the fourth power chord sixteen times, slide down to the first power chord and hit it eight times, switch to the second power chord and hit it three times then slide up the the third power chord (two frets up) and hit it five times.

Focus on learning the progression in one key to get used to the sound and movement.,
Set a metronome to 4/4 time, at a speed you can comfortably play along with.,
Play the I chord for four bars to kick off the progression.,
Play the IV chord for two bars, then return to the I chord for two bars.,
Play one bar of the V chord.,
Play one bar of the IV, the I, and the V again to get back to the beginning.,
Return to four bars of the I chord and repeat.,
Use the ""shuffle"" or swing feel when strumming.,
Play the root note of each chord at the beginning of the measure to keep the progression alive.,
Start with two quick strums of the E power chord.,
Place your ring finger two frets down, on the A, and strum two more quick strums.,
Keep alternating the E and A for four full bars.,
Drop down one string to the A-chord after four bars.,
Again, place your ring finger two frets down and alternate every beat for two measures.,
Return to the E power chord pattern for two bars.,
Add your ring finger one string down and two frets over to go from the E to a B.,
Use your pinky to stretch all the way to the sixth fret on the G string.,
Use this alternating, two-note pattern through all three measures of the turnaround.,
Add in some palm muting, the pentatonic scale, and mixed up rhythms for the second half of each bar for a unique riffing and solo style.",How to Play Twelve Bar Blues," The twelve bar blues are a chord progression -- a set structure of movement to build a blues song. Thus learning the form in one place completely makes it easy to transpose to any key. For example, you could memorize the chords in the key of E, then worry about getting other keys later on. For this tutorial, stick to E. The standard blues progression has only three chords -- the I, the IV, and the V, where the starting cord (the I) is an E. The fourth chord (IV) is an A, and the five chord (V) is a B.









If the Roman numerals are confusing you can just ignore them. They correspond to the number of the note in the major scale -- the first, fourth, and fifth note. The fourth note of the E-major scale is an A, the fifth a B.
Make sure you know at least the major scale and the minor penatonic scale before continuing.;
, The twelve bar blues is simply a set chord pattern played in 4/4 time, which is the most common time signature in music -- turn on any radio song and count ""1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1..."" if you need help getting a feel for it. One bar is this count from 1-4, so the twelve bar blues is a progression of 12 of these counts.









Metronomes are essential practice tools, as they help you time up your transitions where they should be and get used to the twelve bars, exactly.
Bars are also called ""measures.""
A good practice speed for beginners is 60 BPM or so.

, For example, keeping the blues in E, you would start with four bars of an E. Simply strum it, keeping count, for four bars.









For a bigger, more bluesy sound you can play 7th chords, like an E7. For now, however, just focus on the progression.

, Slide off your E and head to the A, which is the fourth chord in the key of E. Then return to the E for two more bars.








, You hit the V chord, here a B, once after the first eight bars are done. This is the beginning of the ""turnaround,"" or the end of the twelve bars.








, The ending a twelve bar blues is called the turnaround. You run quickly through every chord, hit the V one last time, and then start over. In the case of E major, you want to play one measure of B, A, E, and then a final B.








, Once you get through all twelve bars you're back at the beginning. Just keep repeating the same pattern to keep your song rolling. This is the twelve bar blues in E. As long as you can figure out the intervals between the I, IV, and V using the major scale (remember, the 4th note of the scale is the IV chord), you can now play the blues in every key.









For example, in the key of A you would play A(I), D(IV), E(V).

, Most songs in 4/4 are ""straight."" This means that on every count (1, 2, 3, 4) you strum the guitar once. But the blues has a shuffle rhythm, or a swing step, that uses a quickly alternated up-down strumming pattern. Think of playing with the rhythm, ""1 and, 2 and, 3 and, 4 and, 1 and..."" You strum down on the ""one"" with a long stroke, then a quick upstroke on the ""and."" The final rhythm has a long-short, shuffling feel to it.









Listen to some old B.B. Kind or Muddy Waters, to hear the shuffle-strum in action. Not how it keeps the song moving forward, even on slower, sadder songs.

, If you want to play something a little more unique than straight chords you can pick up a riff that follows the chord progression. To keep the classic twelve-bar melody alive, you want to start each bar on the appropriate chord. If the chord is the I chord, here an E, you want the first note played in the measure to be an E. From here you can then improvise or play around to get new sounds on the 12-bar blues.









The following riff will continue in the key of E, and is a good example of how to add new notes and riffs to the basic blues. That said, feel free to take these licks and improvise on them to make them unique.

, You're going to kick things off exactly how you started the basic pattern. Turn the metronome on, and use the shuffle rhythm to count out a ""1 and,"" on the E chord.








, Simply stretch your ring finger down two frets and do the exact same pattern for ""2 and."" You want to keep your index finger down, so that whenever you pick the A up you're right back to your original E power chord. Putting it all together, you should end up with half a bar of alternating notes.








, You'll play each note twice in each bar. If you were counting it out, it would sound like: ""E and, A and, E and, A and..."" Complete this for four bars.









This is exactly the same amount of time you'd play the I chord, or the E, in a normal twelve-bar chord progression.

, Again, you want to change chords at the exact time as the original twelve-bar progression learned above. Use your index finger to create the A power chord just like you created the E.








, Land your ring finger two frets down to the D. Play the quick up and down rhythm for ""2 and,"" then release the ring finger back to the A on your index finger. Play this for another four bars.








, Again, this is just like the original progression, which went E-E-E-E-A-A-E-E-B-A-E-B.








, After your two bars of E, it's time to hit the V chord again, here a B. To get to a basic B power chord, simply add your ring finger two frets down, one string over. Like the rest of the measures, you'll strum this for a quick ""1 and"" before modifying it.









Use your second finger, when possible, to get to the 4th fret -- it will make the next step much easier.

, For E and A, you had to stretch two frets down with a second finger. But, since you're already using two fingers for the B, you need to stretch your pinky way down to the sixth fret to get the same alternating effect as the other two chords.








, Instead of hitting the next A chord, hit the A-D alternating chord. Then the pattern you started with for the E, followed by the A and a last run at the B. Basically you are using this riff in the place of the actual chords, simply using the first note (which always matches the twelve bar blues) to imply the basic structure and melody.








, Palm muting is placing the fatty part of your strumming hand lightly on the strings at the bottom of the guitar, making them sound dull and percussive. The minor pentatonic scale, often known as the blues scale, is a collection of notes perfect for any blues song, and you can add them in the last half of each bar for some blazing licks. And, while the shuffle rhythm is classic blues, the turnaround often features harder, more dramatic strumming, or even softer, lighter strums, depending on the mood. Either way, it is a good place to change things up.

Select a melodic song.,
Listen closely for patterns in the song.,
Play the notes in the song one-by-one and observe how they sound.,
Determine the melody of the song.,
Play a tone a fifth above the tonic to determine the chord progression of the song.,
Repeat this process for each chord change.,
Sing a section of the melody.,
Use call and response training.,
“Noodle” around on your instrument to improve your ear.",How to Play by Ear," A strong melody will be easier to learn to play by ear.


Rock or folk songs usually have strong, easy to recognize melodies.
Avoid songs with inconsistent melodies, such as rap and hip hop tracks.;
, In music, notes combine in a specific way to make a scale or chord, and chords come together to form chord progressions. Chord progression patterns are especially common in popular music, so you should be able to recognize common patterns when you hear them.Recognizing chord progression patterns will help you to anticipate chord changes as you listen to a piece of music.
For example, popular songs like ‘La Bamba’ and ‘Twist and Shout’ share one of the most common chord progressions of all time. If you can play the chords for one of these songs, you can easily play other songs with the same or similar chord progression.

, This will help you find the key of the song.


To find the key of the song, you must first find the tonic or the root note, which is the first and last note in the scale of the song.For example, in the key of C Major, the tonic is C. The notes in a scale or key are like a family, so they are related and center around the tonic of the key.
The tonic or the root note of the song will be the tone that sounds the most ‘at home’ in the song. It will sound like it could fit just about anywhere in the song.

, Now that you’ve found the key of the song, try to find the melody based on the notes in the key.For example, in the key of C, the notes are C,D,E,F,G,A,B,C, so the melody will fall within these notes.

, In general, the notes of scales and chords are assigned specific numbers. So, the fifth is a fifth note of the scale.If we use ‘La Bamba’ as an example, it is in the key of C major. So, G is the fifth degree of C Major, as you go five degrees up from C Major, i.e. C,D,E,F,G, A,B,C.It’s best to play a fifth above the tonic as the fifth is always the second most stable tone in any key.This tone should also feel like it could belong in any part of the song, though not as strongly as the tonic.

, Focus on finding the root note for each of the chords, and then determine the fifth.


For example, the root of the next chord in ‘La Bamba’ is F. To determine the fifth of the F chord, count five degrees up from F and this gives us C, i.e. C, D,E,F,G,A,B,C.Continue the same process for the next chord.
Focus on playing each chord in sequence along with a recording of the song. This will help you determine if you are playing the right chords. If a chord sounds off, go back and try to adjust it based on your ear.

, Though you may not have the most beautiful singing voice in the world, singing will help to improve your ear.Your voice forms an important line between your instrument and the music you hear in your mind. If you can sing the intervals and chords of the song accurately, you will have an easier time identifying and playing them by ear.
If you aren’t used to singing out loud, record yourself as you play a note on your instrument and then try to match your voice to it. Slide up or down on the scale until you can locate the note with your singing voice.
Continue to do this with several other notes. Try to match the pitch of the note in your mind before singing it out loud. Don’t worry about notes that are too low or too high for you to sing well.
Test your ear training by playing a note and then trying to sing it correctly. String several notes or sections of the song together and then try to play and sing it at the same time as one consistent melody.

, You can do this exercise alone or with a teacher or peer.Your teacher or peer will play a section of the song. You can also record yourself playing a section of the song.
You will then repeat the section of the song by listening to the person play or the recording of your playing.
Your teacher will listen to your response and give you feedback to improve your playing. Keep doing call and response until you can play a section or sections of the song.

, Playing around or “noodling” on your instrument allows you to find sounds and patterns you like, especially when you’re just starting to learn how to play your instrument.This will allow you to build an alphabet of fingering sequences, which are the building blocks of musical phrases and melodies.
After enough “noodling”, you may be able to link together several fingering sequences and locate a tone you want to play in a sequence.
While most music teachers may disapprove of playing around on your instrument, it is a great way to become familiar with tones and chords by ear, which you can then also recognize in popular songs and try to learn based on what your ear recognizes.

A classic Chord Progression: Place the slide directly above the metal fret at the 12th position, strum or finger pick 1,2,3,4 beats and move the slide to the next position.,
The progression is what the left hand would play on a piano.,
Experiment to find other three or four chord progressions.,Many 3 Chord progressions (1st, 4th, 5th)




,
Many 4 Chord progressions, with ""turn-around"" (8th, 6th, 4th, 5th).

,
Tablature: There are probably few examples of Cigar Box Guitar tablature, here is one blues scale riff...,


This progression came from a guitar booklet called Basic Blues by Will Schmid.
",How to Play a 3 String Cigar Box Guitar," There are eight notes between the low D and High D’ strings (an octave).

, On the Bass clef it is Good Boys Do Fine Again and ACE G on the spaces., There is a whole step (skip a fret) between everything except B&C and E&F (1/2 step or next fret up).

From C to C' there is a pattern: W, W, H, W, W, W, H, where W=Whole step (skip a fret) and H=Half step (next fret up)., To play a D Major scale (from low D to high D') follow this second pattern. Practice this pattern with ""finger fretting"" and also with a slide.
, Similar to the above pattern, except the C is a natural - fret above the B. Start in the 5th fret on G, then play the notes up to high G.
In Western music many chords are made up of a triad; the 1st, 3rd, and 5th notes of a scale. Due to the limitations of this instrument (only 3 strings), a chord is made of the 1st and 5th notes in the scale. For example, an A chord is composed of A and E (and A’). This means a barre placed across the 3 strings will make a chord. Use a glass or steel slide to form the barre (or lay one finger across all three strings). Place the slide directly above the metal fret wire to make a crisp note. Keep the slide parallel with the frets when you move it. Pick a note, then slide a fret or two up or down the neck to the next note.
,,,,, Play G (5th fret), C (10th fret), G (5th fret), D (12th fret), G, C, D, C, G or variations thereof.,
Frets: 12th, 9th, 5th, 7th, 12th… repeat three more times; follow-up with a turn-around...
12th, 14th, 12th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 12th., See if you can find the individual notes to a melody that may go to this familiar progression. , G, C, G, D...

The fret numbers are given for the key of D, figure out the fret number for the same progression in the other two keys. Play the 4 chord progression four times, then follow up with the turn-around.,,, The lines represent the strings (fat string at the bottom), the numbers represent the fret to put your finger or slide in.

Learn what Black Metal is.,
Learn who performs it.,
Get an instrument and learn some songs you like.,
Compose original songs.,
Record your songs.,
Start a band.",How to Play Black Metal," It's not all about being a Satanist even though some bands are. If you don't want to write about that kind of stuff, then don't. Many bands choose to write about other subjects such as philosophy, religion, misanthropy, fantasy, mythology, occultism, magic, personal, mental subjects, the cosmos, stars, cosmology, astrology, and seasons. Winter is usually used for season-themed songs.;
, Bands such as Venom, Satryicon, Immortal, Asmodeus, Emperor, Belphegor, Behemoth, and Mayhem are great for learning the basics of how to play black metal. If you don't like Satanic bands, you can try listening to ""unblack"" metal, which is basically Christian black metal, and includes bands like Horde, Frost Like Ashes, A Hill To Die Upon, Miseration, and Ancestor.

, Don't expect to be a wizard when you first pick the instrument up. The black metal guys weren't gods when they started out either. You will need to know how to read music, but learning tabs or symphonic sheets won't matter as long as you can read it and play what you read. If you want to do vocals, learn how to do black metal vocals. if you want to play guitar, learn the guitar techniques of your favorite bands. Bass isn't really heard in the black metal genre, so don't expect to be very loud or recognizable in here. If you want to play drums, learn to blast beat. This will probably require you to have a double-bass drumset. You might also be interested in playing keyboards if you know how to play piano. You can also learn other orchestral instruments if you like symphonic or atmospheric black metal.

, Again, don't expect to be awesome when you start. Chances are that your first riffs will sound like your favorite artists. This happens with all beginning musicians. Don't give up.

, Find a way to record your songs. You can do it in a professional studio, a homemade one, or even record it with an audio recording device.

, Find other metalheads and try to start a band. Be sure to have common influences. A great place to try to find band-mates is at heavy metal shows, so go there and try to meet other musicians and see if you can start a band with your original material.

First join your school systems orchestra first chance you get, hopefully when you are fairly young.,
Pick up your viola from the school if they order it for you, or buy one.,
Get a shoulder rest.,
First learn the notes.,
Learn your scales when you are young.,
See if you can learn easy songs like ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"", ""Hot Cross Buns"", ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"" and other easy pieces like that.

,
As your years progress practice at home, though maybe not as often as most teachers say, i.e 1 Hour Every day is too much for a beginner, as you progress to more difficult pieces or a variety, you can easily spend an hour working at it.

,
Throughout the years stick with it!,
If you are older you might compete with the orchestra against other schools or even audition to become part of a festival.,
Enjoy the instrument by learning fun, cool sounding pieces like classic, fun songs, i.e.,
As you age, chances are, if you stick with a classical instrument, you'll learn to love classical music.,
Optional: If you like, you could look up musical groups that are classical instruments.",How to Play the Viola in a School Orchestra," Then choose the viola.;
, You should look to make sure there's no scratches if you get a secondhand one. Make sure you have a nice clean bow and rosin. The viola should fit comfortably in your arms without having to curve your left arm down towards your stomach. One way to test is by holding your instrument on your shoulder and extending your left arm. Your left hand should be at the neck or top of the instrument, not far below or far above. You also need to watch your elbow and make sure that it is slightly bend and slightly pointed towards the front of you body.

, This is crucial so you don't slouch trying to keep your instrument up. You might get a foam shoulder rest from your teacher to attach a pair of rubber bands. You also could go buy one from your local music store that have rubber feet that attach to your instrument. When you attach it to your instrument you want to make sure that the inward curve is right under your chin rest. A shoulder rest is also crucial so you can hold up your instrument just using your head and shoulder not your arm. When buying a shoulder rest you want to make sure that it fits your viola so that it isn't to big and fall off or to small and not fit.

, ALL of them. Try to understand the theory behind them to the best of your ability.

, You will regret not knowing scales or music theory when you are older and auditioning. You should learn how to identify all the keys just by looking at the key signature of the piece.

,,, Some teachers will suck, but chances are you will make good friends with other orchestra players and meet people throughout it. You'll have great opportunities and it looks great on college applications, even if it's not a music school. Also, most schools offer scholarship money to those in the music department. And it's fun, the more you learn.

, Make sure you know scales for an audition.

, ""Thriller"" by Michael Jackson, ""Viva la Vida"" by Coldplay, ""Smooth Criminal"", and a bunch of other songs. Also, musicals, ""Les Miserables"" has an amazing orchestral soundtrack.

, Don't fight it, most of it's pretty beautiful. And if not, well, movie soundtracks usually are mainly instrumental.

, 2CELLOS are two Croatian cellists, Stjepan Hauser and Luka Sulic that play everything from U2 to ACDC to Michael Jackson. The Vitamin String Quartet is well known for their covers of popular songs such as ""Radioactive"" and ""It's Time"" by Imagine Dragons, ""My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light em up)"" by Fall Out Boy, the entirety of Green Day's ""American Idiot"" album and many others. There's also the Piano Guys that combine classical pieces with popular ones, like ""Titanium, Pavane"" or ""Code Name Vivaldi"". See also ""Cello Wars"" which has Star Wars music and sound effects throughout. The group Low Strung does more classic rock songs like ""Stairway to Heaven"" and ""No Sympathy for the Devil"" odds are you'll find a group you favor.

Make sure you have the proper experience.,
Always pay attention to the conductor.,
Listen to the other players, you're not the only one in there.,
If you sit in a chair, always sit at the edge of it.,
Never cross your legs if you are sitting.,
Stay silent at all times unless you have permission.,
Play as one orchestra.,
Don't make a big deal of a mistake.,
Practice the music you receive.",How to Perform in an Orchestra," Anybody can join an orchestra. However, it's not the age, but the talent in which the musician possesses. Make sure you are very familiar with the instrument that you play, as it is important to understand your part in the orchestra,;
, The conductor is the most vital part of an orchestra. He/she controls when the orchestra should start a piece, how loud the orchestra should play, and the speed in which everyone plays it. If you are not paying attention, it may hold up time for everyone else, or even worse, missing out in a concert.


It is important that you understand the hand movements of a conductor when he/she guides the orchestra. Here are some vital movements to know in order to keep up with the group:

Giant upward beginning movement: Get your positions ready! This means to prepare yourself to start a piece.
Slight movements at the beginning: This is the basic beat you will be playing. Keep this beat in mind the whole time, but make sure you still have your eyes on the conductor.
Large downward movement: Start playing the piece!
As you are playing, upward movement: This means the conductor is at the last beat of a measure.
As you are playing, a downward movement: This means the conductor has reached the first beat of a measure. If you get lost, this is the time to catch up!


When playing in an orchestra, make sure you position your music stand in a way so that you can see both the music and the conductor. You should also have the first and last measures memorized, as these are very important parts to look at the conductor,

, In an orchestra, it is extremely important that you are able to hear what the other players are doing. If you are in your own little world playing an entirely different melody, not only it would be extremely embarrassing, but you are letting all of the other orchestra members down.

, It is important that you keep your proper position/posture in an orchestra. Slouching in a chair will only make you sound worse. If you have a habit of sitting in the wrong position, train yourself.

, Always keep your legs in a formal, but relaxed position.

, Not only is talking rude, but if it were to happen at a concert, you could miss something from the conductor.

, Always look around. If somebody is playing something differently than you, try to match them. If you notice that the conductor is showing a different style than you, find a way to express with your instrument what the conductor portrays.

, Although you should play each note perfectly, mistakes occasionally occur. If you do make a mistake, just do your best to get back with the ensemble as quickly as possible.

, Always make sure your playing skills are he best you can do. Relying on the other members to pull your weight will let everyone down.

Fill in the gaps between the one and three to build out your lick.",How to Play Funk Bass1," While a bass guitar does provide a melody line, it considered as part of the rhythm section. It holds the beat down, and it cannot waver. If you want to slap a funky bass, you must have perfect, dependable rhythm for your band, with no exceptions. Always practice with a steady beat to play with.


99% of all funk is in 4/4 time, meaning you count out ""1,2,3,4,"" then repeat the bass line for the next set of four. Set your metronome or practice partner to a comfortable speed on a 4/4 beat and get grooving.

Most modern music is in 4/4 -- it should be the most comfortable rhythm for you.


Funk is not about playing the most notes or the flashiest lines -- it is about building a danceable, hypnotic groove. Precise timing is more important than wild, ever-changing melodies.;
, The first beat is the most important in funk. You need to hit it perfectly, right on time, every time. If your timing is perfectly on the one, hitting that note with a satisfying, killer ""pop,"" you'll find the beat starts to really move. Look no further than recent funk single ""Back to the Future (Part 1)"" by D'Angelo and the Vanguard. The bassline is almost only one note, played on every single beat. But, ever so subtly, he plays the first note twice in a row, giving it a subtle but powerful emphasis. The rest of the band is grounded on the one, as is the listener.

, Funk is built out of 4/4 time, and the first and third notes are the most important. To put a funky spin on any bassline, strip it down to these two notes. Focus on hitting them right on the beat, and don't play any other notes around it. The more precise you are, falling right in line with the drummer, the more funky the groove gets.


To start, just find the one or two notes that you need here. Remember -- funk melodies aren't supposed to be so complex you can't dance to them. Find the key of the song by finding the note that works perfectly on the one, and just stick to that for now. If you know several scales uses those to pick notes for the three beat.
Check out Parliament Funkadelics' ""One Nation Under a Groove."" Note how the bassline almost stops after the three -- letting the four go unsaid. This makes the one pop even more when it comes back, breaking the silence. All the rest of the notes are just filler to make the one and three really stand out.
Play with how long you let the notes ring out. Try sharp, short notes that ""pop"" right on the one, then hold the three a little longer. Reverse it. Once you start learning to build a groove with just these two simple notes, you'll be leagues ahead of most beginner bassists.

, The one and the three form the funky spine, and should always be emphasized over the rest. But the fun comes from the in between. Start improvising a few notes on the two and the four, always coming sharply back to your backbone to keep the groove going. You can fill it out with a scale, you can walk up the fretboard towards the three, or you can play with silences and longer-held notes. Just keep the one and three solid and the rest will fall into place.


Listen to Sly and the Family Stones long, incredible instrumental break in ""Sex Machine"" for a master course from bassist Larry Graham. The one and the three are sharp notes, and he leaves space around them. They hold the groove down. But the two and four are filled with quicker, quieter notes that propel the song forward.

Focus on the group.",How to Be First Chair in Orchestra," Being first chair (or concertmaster) is gratifying, because it means that your orchestra director trusts you to lead and occasionally perform solos. However, all that leadership comes with big responsibilities. If music is a priority for you and you feel dedicated to the ensemble you play in, then you just might make a wonderful first chair.Ask yourself some of these questions so you’ll know how to approach your goal:


Will you be able to attend all rehearsals?
Do you have time to practice, so that you know your music well enough for others to follow you?
Do you like helping others if they’re stuck?
How will you support the orchestra if you don’t get first chair? This is important, because there can only be one first chair. If you don’t end up getting it, will you still be dedicated to the group?;
, Some orchestras have tests for first chairs once every two weeks or so. Others have a constant first chair throughout the semester or even the year. Still others allow challengers to compete against the current first chair--each musician plays the same piece, and your teacher or director picks the best performance. Know how you have to try out so that you can prepare yourself.


Check if your orchestra has age limits on who can be first chair. If only eighth-graders are allowed to be first chair and you’re a seventh-grader, spend the year practicing so you’ll perform incredibly next year.
If your orchestra’s first-chair system relies on challenges, don’t challenge the current first chair too often. Challenges take up class time, so you don't want to do them frequently. Also, you might get a reputation as being difficult.

, The best first chairs aren’t divas. Instead, they’re aware that they set an example for the rest of the ensemble, in performance and in rehearsal. If you want to be a good leader, you have to focus on other’s needs as well as your own.


Be courteous to your fellow musicians. Be early for rehearsals, don’t hog sheet music or stands, and don’t trash-talk anyone else’s style.Be available for help when others need it. If someone asks you for advice on their playing, it means that they trust you.

, There’s just no getting around it. It takes a lot of effort and dedication to become first chair. You need to make sure that you’re the best musician you can be, and the best way to get there is by practicing often and well.


Set aside time every day. If you go to school and have other extracurriculars, you probably feel really busy. Promise yourself that you’ll practice a certain amount of time every day, and arrange your schedule so that you can make that happen.Practice in a consistent space. If you can, set up an area--maybe in your bedroom or living room--with a chair, music stand, and mirror (so you can check your posture). This will help you think of music practice as a normal part of your schedule., Many of the most dedicated musicians in your orchestra probably already work one-on-one with a teacher. In private lessons, you can improve your technique even more than you can with practice, because your teacher can point out strengths and weaknesses in your performance that you wouldn’t notice otherwise. This can be enough to give you an edge.


What you say will depend on your history with your instrument and your relationship with your parents. Pick a quiet time, like when you're driving or doing the dishes together, and say ""I've been thinking that I'd like to try private instruction so I can get better at violin. Is that something I could do?""
If your parents can't get you private lessons, do your best to accept it. You can still improve a lot by practicing and attending orchestra.

, Will you be playing a movement, or just a few phrases? Will you be performing for just your teacher or conductor, or the whole class? Make sure you’re prepared for the structure of the tryout, so you start with a confident, unruffled air about you., The night before the audition, gather your family together and play all your audition material exactly as you plan to the next day. This will help you know what it’s like to perform for an audience in a relatively low-pressure way. It will also check that you have all your material memorized (if necessary).If you make a mistake, don’t say so. Keep going and do your best.
If you have very snarky or giggly siblings, then you don’t have to play for them. Just your parent(s) or guardians will do.

, Imagining yourself playing amazingly doesn’t replace practice, but it definitely helps. Before you go to sleep at night, close your eyes and imagine yourself playing confidently and well at your tryout. The day of your performance, your brain will be used to picturing what you need to do, so it will go more smoothly., Whether it’s a challenge or audition, you want to do everything you can to set yourself up for success. Give yourself plenty of time the night before and the morning of your try-out, so you don’t feel rushed.


Prep your instrument. Before you leave your house in the morning, remember to take your instrument with you. Make sure that it’s clean and that you have all the parts you need. Pack extra reeds or rosin if you need them.
Get a good night’s sleep. You’ll perform your best if you’re alert.
Eat a good breakfast. Some performers say that eating a banana helps them calm their nerves.Really, the important thing is to eat food that makes you feel full and energetic.
Wear something lucky (if you have it). You’ll be relying on your musicianship and preparation, of course, but your favorite t-shirt or necklace just might be the boost of confidence you need., Before your try-out, make sure you’re taking deep, slow breaths to calm your body. If you’ve worked hard and practiced to get to where you are, you deserve to feel proud of yourself. Whatever the results of the tryout or challenge are, they’re second to your dedication to your instrument. You can’t do a yoga pose to de-stress yourself in the middle of your audition, but you think some happy thoughts:


You’re a musician, so you belong in an orchestra, and you deserve to take a shot to be a student leader.Your teacher or conductor is rooting for you and wants you to play well.You have set a goal for yourself, and that’s admirable.

, Not to sound like a broken record, but an orchestra is a group of people who come together with the same goal: to make beautiful music. Every person there, including you, contributes to that. With that in mind, try to accept your director’s decision as gracefully as you can.If you don’t get first chair this time, it’s okay--you worked really hard, and you’re going to continue to improve. Congratulate the first chair, and then concentrate on making yourself and the group sound good.
If you get first chair, try to look ahead to your new responsibilities: you have so much to do!

, Now that you’re in the position of the concertmaster, it’s extra-important for you to model good practices for your fellow musicians. You’ve probably been on your best behavior for a while now, but it’s always good to refresh yourself. Do you have habits that are getting in the way, like tapping your toes to keep tempo? It’s time to address them.Always be early to rehearsals, so you’re fully prepared to start at the beginning. Your director probably already says “Early is on time, on time is late,” anyway.

Stay alert. If you start daydreaming and lose your place, you won’t be able to lead your group as well as you could otherwise.
If you notice anyone playing really beautifully, feel free to compliment them (after rehearsal). You’re all there to sound beautiful together.

, Again, there’s simply no way to avoid it. Practicing will make your performances crisper and more artistic. Once you have your basic fingerings down, you will play more confidently at rehearsal. Practice so you can both play well and lead your section more effectively!


If you’re first chair, you might even get a solo. Practice extra hard so you sound your best.
Listen to recordings of your part when you’re doing other things, like walking to school or falling asleep., If you’re ever feeling stressed or stuck, the conductor of your ensemble is your best source of guidance. Whether you’re trying to get a particular phrase down perfectly or worried about conflict in the group, you don’t have to solve all the orchestra’s problems by yourself.Be direct when you ask for help. Say something like ""I'm having trouble getting the first few bars of the second movement right. Do you have any advice about how to make it sound more natural?""
To avoid tattling, don't use anyone's name.
If there is a lot of internal conflict and rivalry in your orchestra, it’s not your job to solve it.

, At the end of the day, everything you do as first chair--even your amazing solo--is done with the goal of making the whole orchestra sound great. Focus on lifting up your stand mate, your section, and your whole group, blend, and be a supportive presence, and you’ll make beautiful music with your fellow musicians."

Get physical with your strings.,
Let repetition become your friend, to a point.,
Don't be afraid of spaces and silences.,
Learn funky bass lines that you love to expand your vocabulary.",How to Play Funk Bass2," The big bad strings of a bass can take a lot of abuse, and you should feel free to really play with them. Strum softly with your thumb, then pluck hard on a lower strings to get the crisp, satisfying pop. Slap the string with your palm to get it ringing. Play muted notes, where you aren't pressing fully on the fret, to get a percussive ""note"" instead of a melody. Varying these ""textures"" is a great way to build an essential sense of rhythm into your bass lines., Funk gains power through repetition. You are the one keeping the band and melody on track, providing a sturdy base to dance on. You don't want to be switching up your licks or grooves every 2-3 bars, you want to be reliable. However, the occasional deviation is exciting, fresh, and funky. Every 4 bars or so, mix it up -- hitting a higher version of your root note, sliding out of the lick, etc. By restraining yourself, you make your subtle deviations even more exciting.


Stevie Wonder's ""Higher Ground"" has a kicking, relatively regular bassline. But, when Stevie's' voice kicks it up an octave, he switches up the final two beats with a nasty little slide that signals the shift in and out of the chord change.

, The notes you play are just as important as the ones you don't. Syncopation, which is when you leave pauses and spaces where listeners expect a note, is crucial to good funk. In general, spaces are used to make the note immediately before or after feel more important, meaning the two and four beats are great places to put a little silence.


Rhythmic variety is created by having spaces. And variety, especially when synced up with your drummer, is where the funk starts to shine.
Check out Kendrick Lamar's ""King Kunta,"" paying attention to the just barely syncopated pause after the three beat. You expect the note to hold, like it does after the one, but the unexpected syncopation gives it a fresh, immediately danceable feel.

, Once you have the rhythm down, getting the groove with a few simple notes, you can expand your funky chops but copying the masters. Look up the tabs to every song that catches your ear. Focus on getting them perfect, note for note. How do other masters fill in the gaps? How do they emphasize the one and three? How do they use silence to their advantage? While you should listen to anything you love, some classic bassists to start with include:


Larry Graham (with Sly and the Family Stone, Graham Central Station)
Bootsy Collins (with Parliament-Funkadelic, James Brown, his own band)
James Jamerson (with the James Brown Band)
Victor Wooten (solo, with SMV)

Learn the minor pentatonic scale.,
Learn the major pentatonic scale for a more upbeat feel.,
Play a major scale for warm, happy tones.,
Play the minor scale for a darker, sadder tone.",How to Play Funk Bass3," This scale is a great way to throw some melodic variation into your lines, and fits neatly over funk, blues, rock, and pop chord progressions. It has a slightly moody, bluesy feel. As always, find the one and three and make them shine, often using the root note. The following is the A-minor pentatonic scale. The note in parenthesis is a grace note, used for a bluesy feel, that can be left out if you want:
G|----------5-7-(8)-|
D|-----------5---7-|
A|-----5-(6)-7-------|
E|-5-8-------------|

, The major pentatonic offers the variation loved in pentatonic, but it has a happier feel. It's not quite as bright as the major scale, but it's still a good mood kind of scale and is used accordingly. The following is for the A-major pentatonic scale:
G|-----------4---6-|
D|-----------4---7-|
A|-----4---7-|
E|-5-7-------------|, Start the scale on the root note and play from there, using the scale to help your find notes for your licks. The following scale is for A Major, since it starts on the fifth fret (an A):
G|-----------------|
D|-----------4-6-7-|
A|-----4-5-7-------|
E|-5-7-------------|, Not used a tone in funk, but still easily modified for funk, this note will give you a bit of a darker, more intense feel for songs that call for it. When played straight, it may sound a little too sad, but that focus on rhythm will give it the pulsing feel that makes it funk. This is for A minor:
G|-----------------|
D|-------------5-7-|

Walk into the room confidently and play to your best ability.,
If there is an interview, answer all questions to the best of your knowledge.",How to Get Into a Professional Orchestra," You need to be able to commit the necessary amount of time to be at rehearsals and concerts. Because you get paid to be in the orchestra, you need to earn your money. If you have sloppy attendance, you will not be familiar with the music and you could get fired. Make sure that your schedule allows plenty of time for rehearsals, concerts, and most importantly, practice! If you are already a very busy person, you will need to prioritize.;
, Each orchestra works differently. Some orchestras hold auditions every year while others only hold auditions when someone leaves. Find out when the orchestra you're interested in holds auditions and book your audition time as soon as you can so you get first dibs. Some orchestras hold special auditions for principal players. In other words, when the principal of a section leaves, there will be a ""competition"" for those interested in replacing him/her. If you are interested in becoming a principal of a section, make sure you find out the requirements for that.

, Some orchestras might hold an interview before/after the audition. Check to see if the orchestra requires you to hand in something (i.e. resume) If you need to prepare a resume, make sure you include any previous orchestral experience, previous work experience, awards you have won, etc.

, Listen to recordings of the pieces that the excerpts come from and become familiar with the style, tempo, and musical interpretation. If you are still taking music lessons, go over the audition material with your teacher. Practice frequently!

, Make sure you eat breakfast that morning. Dress as if you were going to a job interview. Warm up before leaving. Warm up again when you get there.

, When you are done, leave the room confidently.

, Take time to think before answering.

Emotion. One of trance's main characteristics lies in the emotional factor that it places in the listener. Much of modern trance music places emphasis on a ""build-up and breakdown"" measure associated with progressive trance, which is good in moderation. Be aware that trance music did not start using progressive build-ups and breakdowns until about the late 90s. Prior trance would typically keep the same beat for the length of the entire song.
Repetition. Trance music is usually very repetitive. This is not to be associated with a negative connotation, as repetition is one of the factors that helps to instill the emotional aspects of the genre. You should be mindful of making any repetition flow naturally. Repetition that does not flow properly will tend to ""mimic a broken record"", per se, making it difficult for listeners to adapt to and connect with the sound.
The quarter-note bass kick. The quarter-note kick helps to retain the emotional factor that is created by repetition. Almost all trance music has a defining quarter-note bass kick that usually remains for the majority of the song. Keep in mind that the quarter-note kick does not have to be an overpowering bass note; you might choose a subdued sound. Similarly, many artists will begin with a series of ambient sounds and gradually work the listener into the main melody.
Beats per minute. Most trance lies within the range of 130-150 BPM. Sometimes it may drop below 120 BPM—particularly in ambient trance—but it generally does not exceed 150 BPM, as this begins to border hardcore electronic music, which is another genre in itself. For a lot of EDM genres, 128 BPM is good, and is very good for trance music, because it is somewhat midtempo, but has an easily danceable feel. It is also good for the style of dance used in trance music, which is jumping up and down repeatedly with hands in the air.;
, While copying another artist's music isn't the best idea, there is nothing wrong with listening to other artists for inspiration and ideas. Listen to a lot of trance music to determine what you like, what inspires you, and what kinds of music you would like to make.

Remember that there are several different subgenres of trance. The sound of trance has changed considerably from what it sounded like a decade ago. Be sure to get a feel for trance from the early 90s along with trance that is released today.
Many great recording artists keep music from their own genre close at hand. This ""reference work"" will ensure that you retain the fundamentals of the genre that you wish to write a song for. Just as all great painters study their peers for inspiration, so should you.

, Trance may have some universal characteristics, but its melody can vary tremendously across subgenres. Recognize the characteristics of some of these subgenres:

""Classic"" trance. While this isn't a specifically defined subgenre, this refers to early trance that began in the late 80s. This subgenre has a tremendous focus on repetition, slowly changing over the course of the song. Classic trance can be said to be ported from contemporary classical music's ""minimalism"" developed by contemporary composers such as Steve Reich, Terry Riley, La Monte Young, and Philip Glass.
Acid trance. Acid trance is mostly similar to classic trance, except that it has a much more hypnotic and ""trippy"" feel to it. It has a unique sound that is often achieved by playing with filters, pans, and oscillators to create a ""science fiction""-esque sound. See Roland TB-303.
Progressive trance. This subgenre defined the popular ""build-up and breakdown"" themes that are often associated with trance. By slowly building up a progression of melodies and creating a pseudo ""tension"", an outburst of emotional bliss results at the peak of the melody as it ""releases"". These releases are often done by creating a brief lull in the melody before quickly returning to the main theme. Other common techniques include pausing, using rests, rapidly speeding up the BPM, and using progressing kicks from quarter- to eighth- to sixteenth-, note kicks, and so on. The major artists in progressive trance are Tiësto, Darude, Armin van Buuren, and Paul van Dyk.
Goa trance. This subgenre shares many of the characteristics of acid trance, but has a unique ""organic"" sound to it. Goa trance is such a complex and structured subgenre of trance that many other ""sub""-subgenres originated from goa trance, itself.
Psychedelic trance. Also known as psytrance, this subgenre is very similar to goa. In what goa trance creates for an organic feel, psytrance creates an electronic, futuristic feel. Psytrance tends to use more sci-fi ambient sounds together with the techniques used in acid trance.
Ambient trance. This subgenre tends to use a much slower BPM and places less emphasis on the quarter-note kick. Many ambient artists do away with the quarter-note measure altogether and drop to half-note measures or other measures. Ambient trance generally uses softer sounds and maintains an ""easy listening"" feel, while still retaining the repetitive and emotional characteristics associated with trance.
Tech-trance. Tech-trance is a fusion between techno and trance. It is very tough. It doesn't focus on a melody, at times a melody will be used in the breakdown. Usually focuses around the talent to manipulate one note and edit it to make a very industrial sounding synth. Some names to check out who specialize in tech-trance are Sander van Doorn, Abel Ramos, Bryan Kearney, Randy Katana, and Marcel Woods.

, How it is sectioned and divided? What percussion was just added or removed? How did the melody change? What all is going on? What sort of ambient noises can you hear in the background?

, You'll need a high end machine that can handle making and editing sounds if you are looking to produce quality music. Here are some important specifications to consider.


Processor. Dual core processors are particularly effective in streamlining functionality and improving performance while writing trance music. Quad cores are also brutally effective, but are expensive. Additionally, some machines still don't possess the capabilities to handle the power of a quad core processor.

Hard drive space. Higher quality sounds mean larger sound files. Keep in mind that you aren't writing music using MP3 quality, which averages a bit rate of 128 to 320. You'll want the highest quality bit rates for sounds when working to develop your music. The size of your hard drive can vary significantly, depending on the sounds that you intend to use. 250GB of hard drive space is a very liberal amount.

RAM. Two gigabytes of RAM (2GB) is a fair starting measure. 1GB of RAM tends to push the limit, and anything under 1GB becomes particularly difficult to work with effectively.

Sound card. You'll need a high quality sound card. An internal M audio ""Audiophile"" sound card with RCA will do fine, as well as an external ""fast track"" USB sound card with microphone input/RCA. This is also good for recording mixes.
Music producing/editing software. This will be further detailed below.

, Ableton Live, Reason, and/or FL Studio are good programs that you can use to help you to make beats, breaks, and a bass line. (Or, if you own a Mac, try GarageBand or EasyBeat, or Logic Pro for more advanced composing. On Linux LMMS would be just fine and also runs in Windows) Time and dedication will show the best results.

, Get a feel for the sounds you can make and for your style. Try modding the pre-programmed sounds that you like.

, Oscillators, waveforms, filters, LFOs. Synths presets are a good way of getting started, but programming the sounds yourself will be far more beneficial in the long run.

, While using predefined melodies and sounds is useful for beginners making trance, you are better off developing your own unique sound. There are plenty of free VSTs (virtual studio technology) out there, all of which will improve the standard of your music.


KVR Audio is a great site for downloading VSTs, and Synth1 or SuperwaveP8 are good and easy-to-program synths.
If you are willing to spend a bit of money (~$90) , Nexus is THE VST you want for the best trance lead sounds. Another mentionable VST is V-Station, which is great for trance-specific production. Vanguard is another great VSTi that can be purchased. Also Sylenth , and Spectrasonics omnisphere for pros. Gladiator 2 and zebra synths are also very good.
Psytrance and Goa trance bass sound can be difficult to program from scratch on a general purpose synth if you're a beginner; Alien303 is very a good start for this until you get the grasp on how to do the sounds yourself.

, The M Audio MIDI board, Oxygen O2, Keystudio, or M-audio Axiom or Novation are good for beginners. You may need drivers for the desired MIDI board of your choice. You can download necessary drivers for M Audio straight from their website.

, KRK, Mackie, Behringer, or Fostex will do you good. Make sure that they come with at least a 3"" subwoofer—you'll need it for the kicks and bass in trance. Also, your speakers should have at least a 1"" tweeter. Don't waste your money on cheap gear! Brand names do pay off.

, Don't worry if it doesn't sound great at first; you will get better with practice. Try to be critical of yourself, but also spotting ways you can improve. Remember you're not at their level until you work your way up there. It takes practice.

, You don't need to go right to a producer and show your work, but you might create a Facebook or Soundcloud.com music page to get your name out there. Find a way to promote yourself. Remember: If one person doesn't like you, that's just one person's opinion.

, Once you feel that your productions are turning out positive, try to get one signed. It will be very difficult, but the end result will leave you truly accomplished. You may need to send out at least 100 demo submissions to labels all over the world before you get any notable recognition.

, There are several aspects to consider while doing this.

Export your track from your software. Use the format of your choice (usually in lossless .FLAC). Many programs allow you to export to .MP3 as well, but be certain that you use the V0 variable bitrate preset).
Note that most media players will only play 16-bit FLAC files, although you can download codecs to play 24-bit .FLAC if you insist on using it.


Upload your file, using a file sharing site of your choice. There are countless sites, but YouSendIt is particularly notable. It is not free, but it allows you to send songs directly to anyone's email address. Generate a direct .MP3 URL to your file and copy and paste it to all of your demo submissions. Include any extra background information that you wish, such as your email, your Myspace, and so on.
Create a Myspace music page. You should upload only samples to your page, since there is a size limit of about 6MB. Remember to keep your sound quality above 296kbps. This way, you'll offer a good preview in good quality, which will attract more visitors. Uploading a fraction of your song is also a safety precaution to avoid users ripping your full-length music.

A common embellishment to any chord is the 7th.,
This chord will resolve itself into another chord, depending on if its base is the dominant, sub-dominant or tonic chord.,
Sometimes ""maj7"" is super-scripted.",How to Play Chords in Music13," The 7 super-scripted above the Chord name means a minor seventh. The ""C7"" means to play the ""C"" chord (C-E-G) with a ""B-Flat"".

, A tonic and sub-dominant 7th will usually resolve into the tonic or sub-dominant, respectively. The dominant 7th is the usual way the dominant chord is played and will usually progress into another chord.

, In that case, play the regular 7th note. The 7th will invariable lead into something else, hence the term ""Leading Tone"".

Know what a 1-4-5 Progression Is.,
Play a Basic Rhythm.,
Jazz It Up.,
Add The Sixth Note and Major Seventh Note.,
Rock On.",How to Play a 1 4 5 Bass Progression," The numbers in 1-4-5 refer to the corresponding notes/chords in a musical scale. For example: C D E F G A B C (C major scale) = 12345678 (C is designated as ""1"" because it is the first note of the scale.) Using this information, you can determine that in the C Major scale a 1-4-5 progression would translate to C-F-G. So for a 1-4-5 in C Major, the chords that you'll be playing under will be C Major, F Major, and G Major.
, The simplest way to play under a 1-4-5 is to play one note on the first beat of the measure that sustains for the entire measure: |: C - - - | F - - - | G - - - | C - - -  :| This simple rhythm can be expanded upon in a few ways: |: C C C C | F F F F | G G G G| C C C C :| (or) |: C C - - | F F - - | G G - -| C C - - :|, Adding a few extra notes into the mix makes the beat more lively and establishes a groove. An easy way to do this is to play this: |: C E G C | F A C F | G B D G| C E G C :| (All you are doing here is playing the first, third and fifth notes of the scale of the chord that you are playing under. If that sounds a little complicated, just play the notes and it will sound good regardless.), This gives the progression a more bluesy feel. This will generally require you to play under each chord for two or more measures, so only do it if that's what the song requires. |: C E G A|Bb A G E|F A C D |Eb D C A|G B D E | F E D B | C E G A |Bb A G E :|, Play with other musicians to increase your proficiency with your new found skill. Also, a jazzed up 1-4-5 sounds pretty cool if you're playing alone or if you're warming up while waiting for the guitarist to quit jacking around with his pedal board(s)."

Know the syllabus.,
Practice, practice, practice!,
Know which part of the syllabus you need to work on most, and what you can improve, and then work on it.,
Do not be afraid of aural!,
On the day of your exam: The most important thing is to be calm, relax, and try not to think about it.,
Turn up early, and definitely warm up and run through pieces and scales beforehand.,
Introduce yourself and your music calmly to the examiner waiting until he asks.

,
Stay calm and composed, do not show your nerves.,
Check your sight-reading piece.,
Practise with your accompaniment so they know your style of playing.

",How to Pass Your Music Exam," You may be doing musical knowledge over scales, improvisation instead of aural. Know the order you are playing the pieces in, and rehearse with the accompanist beforehand. It is CRUCIAL you know exactly what the examiner is marking you on.;
, It can't get stressed enough; the better you know the pieces, the better you will do in the exam.

, For example, as you get to the higher grades, playing fluently, and with expression is very important.

, One used to hate aural, until they realised, hey, it's not worth many marks, and doesn't (really) matter if it goes horribly wrong. It's a way to pick up extra marks! Know all the questions the examiner will ask, and the possible answers. Listen to as many styles of music as you can and practise looking for style, dynamics, time signature etc. on those.

, It will always make you nervous, but relaxing can help you play your best.

,

When it's time to go in, smile and say hello to the examiner. Don't be put off by him/her; they may look intimidating, but they are not allowed to be too horrible!,, Look as calm as possible. Stand straight and hold your instrument carefully (or singing stand straight up) and wait to hear the examiner tell you to play/sing

, You normally have enough time to play it through once.

Familiarize yourself with audio editors.",How to Make Music Using a Computer," DAW stands for Digital Audio Workstation. Different DAWs have different system requirements, so knowing which DAW you’ll use can help you determine the kind of computer you’ll need to build or buy. There are many DAWs available, so you should research the one best for you, but a few popular options include:Image-Line FL Studio, which is one of the more robust options in the Fruity Loops brand. As a bonus, this DAW generally includes free updates.

Ableton Live is a popular choice among composers and performers. It integrates well with supplemental hardware, like synthesizers and the Push 2 controller.

Think of controllers as a physical interface for your DAW. By pressing a button on a controller, you can create sound in your DAW.



Steinberg Cubase Pro is a well-balanced DAW with specialized digital tools, like the chromatic adjustment function in the Sampler Track interface.

Avid Pro Tools is perhaps the best known DAW among lay-producers. Pro Tools is a dependable DAW that you'll find in many studios.

Apple Logic Pro is relatively easy to use, with clear labels and intuitive graphical user interface. However, this DAW is only available for Apple products.Reaper is a DAW you can download and use for a trial period of 60 days. Following that, you'll be asked to pay $60 or make a donation, but you'll still have the option to decline payment and continue using the program.;
, You can save money on computer costs with a low-end video card since you won’t need sharp graphics to produce music. When using the DAWs Pro Tools, GarageBand, or Logic, consider buying a Mac, as these DAWs are either Mac only releases or run optimally with Mac specifications. Additionally:


Prioritize laptops for live performing. If you don’t plan on performing, a desktop computer will likely save you money, function better, and last longer.
Choose a computer with a high processor speed. Your computer should have a 3.0 dual core processor, minimum.
Outfit your music production computer with at least 8 GB of RAM and 500 GB of hard drive space. This will ensure you have enough space for a sound library and that your computer runs smoothly., Although DAWs can digitally reproduce many instruments, samples of live recordings often sound more authentic.For this reason, you may want or need equipment like keyboards, synthesizers, microphones, controllers, electric guitars, and more.


This equipment can be very expensive. Prioritize equipment from the most to least useful. Save money over time and buy equipment one piece at a time to build your stockpile.
When evaluating equipment usefulness, think about your personal skills and abilities. If you are a trained drummer, for example, a digital drum kit would likely be useful.
Production equipment can also reduce the processing/emulation your computer must do, which can help your computer run smoother.
Controllers and synthesizers can make physically interacting with your DAW much more intuitive and natural., Watch YouTube tutorials for the DAW you’ve selected. Familiarize yourself with its features. Take notes from experienced users and tutorials on how to make your DAW produce music most efficiently.Each DAW will be different and have different features. Even if you’re somewhat familiar with the general layout of DAWs, it may take time and training before skillful usage comes naturally.
There may be free courses online teaching how to use your particular DAW. Professional DAWs oftentimes have tutorials for owners. Search online to find and make use of these resources.

, Although there are exceptions, generally you should keep the number of parts (including vocals and instruments) in your track to about 5 or 6. Too many parts can create a muddy or oversaturated sound. Choose the tempo (speed) of the music by setting the metronome (sometimes marked by “BPM” (Beats per Minute)).

Research the genre of the track you’re trying to create. Some genres have specific characteristics, like the typical 90 BPM range for pop songs or the 120 BPM range for house music.What do you, as a listener, want to hear in the genre of music you are making? This can be a useful guide to the instruments you choose and the tone of your track.

, The bassline is comprised of low-tone pitches and percussion instruments, like drums. This should be fairly simple and repeatable without being tiresome. The trick of a strong bassline is to make it repetitive but catchy.Low-tone notes on instruments besides drums can be a part of your bassline. Try including low-tone chords and low-tone single notes on the guitar and piano.
Loop the main theme of your bassline so it’s steady and plays for most of the track. This main theme may pause during the bridge or change slightly at transitions, like where the verse changes to the chorus.The repetitive, twangy bass of Pink Floyd's hit song ""Money"" and the simple yet insistent low note pulse in ""My Generation"" by The Who are great examples of famous basslines., The melody is the main part of a track that you would hum along to. The melody is often reflected in the lead vocals. Generally, one instrument, one voice, or the combination of an instrument and a voice creates the melody.The melody should sync with the pulse of the bassline.

There are many instruments you can use to make the melody, but popular choices include the piano, guitar, trumpet, trombone, flute, violin, and more.
Try to design your melody so it has contour. The rise and fall of the volume and tone of the melody will be more engaging to audiences.
If you intend to have vocals, it’s most common to have the vocals sing along with the melody. Write lyrics for your vocals if you plan on including them in your track.Popular melodies that you might look to for inspiration for your own include ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" by the Beatles and ""Respect"" by Aretha Franklin., Choose one or two new instruments to add harmony to your track. Include these instruments at various points throughout the track. Use a note, a run of notes, or a chord with these instruments to create tension, build, or emphasis at important parts of the song or to highlight lyrics.Add supplemental instruments sparingly to your track. Adding too many or having supporting instruments play too frequently can make your track heavy and the sound quality muddy.Voices, too, can be added as a supplemental “instrument.” A second/backup voice or chorus, especially during the chorus or emphatic parts, can be effective.Listen to the operatic harmony in the internationally famous Queen song ""Bohemian Rhapsody,"" or the equally impressive harmonies of the Beach Boys in ""I Get Around."", During the middle build of the song you’ll likely want to increase volume and add instruments little by little for its duration. Add an instrument to highlight your favorite lyrics. Hit home the last chorus hard by using a backup chorus to add a sense of weight and depth.When it comes to emphasizing your track, it’s completely a matter of preference. Explore different techniques to find what works best for you.
Unusual sounds, like air raid sirens, rain, and traffic, can sometimes have an unexpectedly positive effect on a track.The bitter chorus of ""Mr. Brightside"" by the Killers is emphasized with additional instruments. Don McLean adds and removes instruments throughout ""American Pie"" to shift mood, heighten emotion, and more.

, Mix your track. Assemble the different parts of the track in your DAW so they fit together seamlessly.Master the track to ensure the volume is balanced between parts. Check any fades and the overall frequency of the song. Moderate extremes so the transition and quality between sounds are both smooth.Keep the volume low when finishing your track. You’ll likely spend many hours making small adjustments until you achieve your desired sound. Moderate and high volumes can damage your hearing over time.
DAWs generally come with finishing tools, like those used for compression. With compression tools, as an example, you can more easily maintain consistent volume throughout a track.

, Your phone can be a powerful tool for capturing unique sounds. Snag samples of natural features, like rain or birds, snippets of catchy conversation, and music being played in the distance on a still day. Download sound packs from the website of your DAW producer. Ask to sample local bands, musical friends, and others.

Organize your music library in an orderly system, much like you'd organize physical files. Use headings like ""brass,"" ""percussion,"" and ""acoustic guitars.""
Because of the wide variety in some categories, you may want to add subcategories under ""master"" headings. For example, you might separate ""high-hats"" and ""ride cymbals"" under the master heading for ""percussion.""

, Plugins add new qualities to existing programs, like added on search engine features in your web browser. Music production plugins can be used for sound many purposes, like in sound editing, as a DAW, as a supplemental synthesizer, and more., Audio editors help you remove static from recorded tracks, modify sound parameters (frequency) to reduce or adjust distortion, add effects, and more. Some highly ranked free audio editors that are useful for gaining familiarity with them include:


Audacity is a powerful sound editing program that, even though free, manages to exceed some pay-to-use editing programs. It comes with a comprehensive manual and is approachable for beginners.

Free Audio Editor has a clear user interface that makes this editor less intimidating. This program has an array of pre-made filters for things like breath and background noise reduction.

Free MP3 Cutter and Editor is an excellent choice for simple edits or light finishing. Though somewhat less robust, this editor is great for things like splitting one long MP3 into multiple segments."

Get a band full of people who want to play the same or similar kinds of music.,
Remember there are three main kinds of metal: Stuff you want to head-bang to quickly, stuff you want to slowly head-bang to, and stuff you want to go crazy to (jumping around and swinging your arms).,
Get one member of your band to come up with their part (lyrics, rhythm or riff) guitar is a good instrument to start with.,
Try to be in sync with one another.,
Decide on a structure.",How to Make Heavy Metal Music," For example, black metal and death metal work well together; Alternative metal and hard rock go great together. Think about other combinations you and your band might like. If you're thinking more creatively, try to make some more unusual genre combinations. An American group called Panopticon combined bluegrass and black metal, so really extend your abilities and ideas. Spread your wings and soar into the world of metal sub-genres.;
, So decide what kind of song you want to make, think of yourself as the listener, what do you feel like listening to right now?

Make it so that it's not just you who will enjoy it, but so that many will enjoy this particular song. Think of the things that make you really dig a song: The vocal melodies, the guitar solos, the riffs or the drum patterns. try to think of new ways these can be combined to form favourable songs.







, From there, you should all think of other parts for the band that would work well with the part that you started with. If you start with a riff, try getting the guitarist to loop it and then ask the drummer to figure out the percussion for it.

This can lead to some interesting ideas, because once the two are stable, other members can jump in and add to the song. Get the lead guitarist to sit back and consider throwing a high melody in, or a solo.






Bassists should try to write something that boosts the song. This could be anything from a simplistic riff that follows the guitars, to an advanced bass riff that is completely individual from the other music, while still fitting the song. Playing a funk riff behind a blazing death metal riff will not always work. (Still give it a try though, you never know what could sound good together).

, For example, if the guitarist/s or bassist/s play a short note and stop then the drummer should also do something similar (like choking the crash/china or whatever they decide).

Also, if you want to have screaming/growling in your music, don't be afraid to let it all out. It all depends on what kind of metal you're trying to make. Especially in metal genres, it is important to work on a coherent unit sound. You don't want the drums to be inconsistent or else it may throw out the rest of the band.
However, if that is the intention for the song then by all means give it a shot, if you believe that the band can pull it off. Experiment with different sounds to find what works for your band, and what sounds good.







, Try to be creative. Instead of using another verse/chorus, add a drum breakdown, or a guitar solo. Make the song invite someone in who may not be into metal. A creative song will also make more people consider your band as a higher standard. Do not write one professional song, then back out with two weaker songs.

Try to maintain a high standard in your writing ability. Write consistently and aim high. When you write one song that people approve of, don't let the rest of your material be slackened.

Choose people who you trust, who are willing to help you, and who other people in the orchestra like. Make sure to have at least 1 person of the opposite gender.

, You need to determine your ""platform"". In any campaign there are issues which people will have differing opinions about. Think about issues and things that you and your fellow orchestra members like and dislike about orchestra right now. Get together with your friends from Step 1 to discuss these things. You all have been in the orchestra, so you know what changes they need the most.
Answer the following questions:


What have past Presidents, Vice Presidents or teachers done in past years that you and your fellow orchestra members have enjoyed and benefited from?
What have past Presidents, Vice Presidents or teachers done in past years that you and your fellow orchestra members have not enjoyed?
If you were elected as Vice-President, what specific things would you change that would benefit the orchestra as a whole? Especially, you want to have a couple key points that are unique from the rest of the people running. Make them popular, fun and interesting.


The answers to those three questions will become the issues that make up your running platform.

Set up 10 Group channels and assign the following to each.,
Put a compressor on every channel.,
Make sure all your group faders are dead center.,
Set all the active channels to approx.,
Listen to the whole mix at a low level, just loud enough that you can hear each sound.,
Go through this procedure 2-3 times with a short break between each run.,
Put your reference CD in again as close to the level you have been mixing at.

Select MONO at your master faders.,
Take a well deserved break.

,
Select STEREO at your master faders.,
Setup two delay sends.,
Take a break and put that reference CD in again at the same level you have been mixing at.,

Shut the bedroom door and turn the lights down low. Killing your visual sense will enhance your hearing sense.;
, Solo a sound and use the high and low shelves on the EQ to cut energy on each side of the spectrum. Dial down the low shelf until you notice the sound quality changing. Then raise the low shelf until you find the point where adding more bass becomes noticeable. The sweet spot is approx. halfway between those two points. Set it and forget it.

,,,, Sweep the frequency until you find the point at where the signal is the loudest. This is the characteristic frequency of the signal. Back off on the Q to zero, then notch the signal up at that point in the frequency spectrum just enough so you can hear and see a couple of decibels of peak gain. Set it and forget it.

, If you have good compressors this will make an enormous difference to your mix. Hit Groups 1-5 with a fairly serious squeeze. Hit groups 6-7 with a very light amount of compression. Hit groups 8 -10 with a medium amount of compression. When you are doing this, tweak your attack and ratios accordingly not to alter the natural sound of the signal. If your compression is low quality, go with less on all 10 groups. If your compression is high quality, you can be more liberal. Set it and forget it.

If a signal sticks out, lower its level in small steps until it fits IN the mix.
If a signal sounds buried, raise its level until it sticks out, then drop it slowly until it fits in the mix.
If the overall mix sounds too bass or boomy, slowly pull down bass and low end sounds.
If the overall mix sounds too treble or harsh bring down those sounds. Do the same with mid range.
If it sounds nasal, bring down some sounds that characteristically live in the mid range.

, Set it and forget it.

,, Make sure nothing sounds distorted. Make sure some sounds have not disappeared from the mix. If they have, find those instruments and see if they can be altered with EQ (or muted altogether) without making the song fall apart. Make subtle EQ and level adjustments to make sure some signals are not ""walking on each other"". You will be able to tell because it will be muddy, murky and undefined. Set it and forget it.

,, Perform the same quick check as you did for mono.


Setup two reverb sends. One with a large room and one with a smaller room. Take the time to tweak them to get a great reverb for your drums and percussion (smaller room) and a great reverb for your background vocals and your keyboards (larger room).

, One shorter and one longer. Make one of them the tempo of the song.

, Listen very closely to how much reverb is used on the instruments. Pay particular attention to the snare, lead vocal, back ground vocals, organs and keyboards. You may be surprised at how dry most of the sounds are.

, Now very carefully add a reverb to GROUP 4. Try long and short verbs. Experiment until the snare sounds right but not taking over the mix in any way.

, You can be fairly liberal and use the long verb. Do the same with GROUP 10.

, You may not want any at all, but a small amount might help.

,,,, Use very low volume for this step and pay particular attention to the lead vocal, kick and bass levels. Make sure the door is closed to the room, the lights are very dim and your ears are in the sweet spot between your near field speakers.

, The lead vocal should be most prominent. The snare next. The kick next.

,, Listen with great concentration. Only listen at this level for one pass of the song and take a break. Pick out obvious level problems; obvious REVERB and DELAY problems; obvious COMPRESSION problems; obvious EQ problems. The key word here is obvious. Don't start tweaking with a sound unless it really sounds bad and out of place.

, The higher the quality, the better.

, We are talking extremely subtle moves here.

Everybody loves candy.",How to Become Orchestra Vice President2," You are going to give away candy to people in order to get their votes. It will give you an easy way to talk to them and tell them about how awesome you are. Plus you are giving them candy, so you are already pretty awesome. Now, when they think of you, they think of candy, and they think of awesomeness.




Go to the grocery store and buy some big bulk packs of individually-wrapped candy (like they have at Halloween). (Everyone likes chocolate. Hershey's Chocolate, Milky Way, 3 Musketeers and Twix are best bets.)

Then go to Office Depot or Walmart and pick up lots of printable mailing label stickers (the cheaper the better, you are going to need hundreds of them, depending on the amount of people in your class. White ones are fine.)

Go home and print out labels that say ""VOTE ______ for Orchestra Vice-President"" and include a catchy slogan/tagline for yourself that you come up with like ""The People's Choice"" or something like that.
Attach those labels to each piece of candy.
Before class each day leading up to the election, you and your helpers from Step 1 will start giving away candy to people in orchestra. Before you give them the candy, get them to promise you their vote. Give them a good reason to do so (one of your keys from question 3 in Step 1)


;
"
"
Show the love
Once they have promised you their vote, you need to give them a way to show everyone else that they are supporting you.",How to Become Orchestra Vice President3," Since it's orchestra, a great idea to do this is by tying a colored ribbon on their instrument (or, alternatively, tying them around their wrist or on the locker where they store their instrument). When your classmates see all the ribbons and all the people who are supporting you it will make you look awesome. You will become much more popular as a candidate. Trust me, people are going to want a ribbon!




Go to the craft store and buy some bright-colored ribbon. Choose a single color that is bright, cool and that everyone, both boys and girls, will like. I'd suggest neon yellow, neon orange or neon blue.
(While you are there, pick up a posterboard in the same color as the ribbon. They should carry neon posterboard. Also get some black sharpies/permanent markers if you need them.)
Cut the ribbon into 9–12 inch (22.9–30.5 cm) strips. You're going to need to have enough for all your supporters.
Write ""I'm voting for (your name) for VP"" on each one.
Take them with you to class and give them to the people who are voting for you. Have them tie them to their instrument, their wrist, or their locker where they store their instrument (or all three!).



"
"


The poster
Now, the poster.",How to Become Orchestra Vice President4," Hopefully you picked up a poster at the craft store with the ribbon. Here's the keys to the poster:Before you start writing on the poster:
Get some scratch paper out to sketch out some ideas of layouts. You need to figure out exactly what you are going to write and draw as well as where you want everything to go BEFORE you start putting it on the posterboard.
Figure out who you want to do the writing on the poster. They need to have neat, legible handwriting.
If you have a friend who is an artist, ask them if they can draw a really cool picture of your face on the poster.




What to put on the poster and how to do it:
""VOTE"" and ""YOUR NAME"". ""Vote"" will go at the very top, above your name. For your name: make it really big and thick. Write it neatly. Put it on the top and have it stretch across the whole width of the poster. You will want to get a regular pencil (not mechanical, the lead is too hard and sharp) and a ruler and LIGHTLY mark two straight lines across where you are going to write it. These are guidelines to mark the top and bottom of your letters so that it is super-neat. You will probably want to lightly sketch out your letters with the pencil on the posterboard before you write them on there so you can figure out the right spacing and look. (This may seem like overkill, but trust me, you don't want to mess up and have to start over again. Don't rush it, take your time and you'll get it right.) Now you can get your permanent marker and write your name.
Write ""for Vice President"" below your name.
Your slogan/tagline. As I mentioned in strategy # 1, you'll want a catchy slogan like ""The People's Choice"". Write that next.
Your image. I can't tell you how important a cool image of face is. Just trust me. If you have a friend who is an artist, have them draw a portrait of you on the poster. If you don't, get a friend to take a picture of you (a good looking headshot). Take the picture into a decent photo editor and make it black and white. Increase the contrast quite a bit to add some visual flare. Then print it out pretty big (it will be right in the middle of your poster).
Your ""platform"". Decide the best points from Step 2 to put on the poster. I'd suggest writing them in bullets. Put your most important points (your ""key"" points from question 3) first, and write them bigger than the rest of your points (questions 1 and 2).(This will fill up the middle section of the poster. Make sure to leave some room at the bottom.)
At the bottom, write ""show your support for me by tying a ribbon around your instrument and on your locker""...""Get a ribbon from me or (the names of your helpers)"".

Consider how much you already know.,
Decide if you're willing to pay for this.,
Do a web search.,
Find a good website.,
Learn concepts one step at a time.,
Retake some lessons if necessary.,
Apply your newly found knowledge to your life.",How to Learn Music Theory Online," Can you play an instrument already? How long have you been playing? Can you even read music? Your prior experience will have an effect on how much you need to learn, where you need to learn it, and how ""simplified"" it'll need to be.;
, Some websites offer free music theory lessons, but to get really in-depth, or be able to get a degree out of your learning experience, you'll probably need to pay and provide a good bit of personal information. If you're just learning for fun, you may not want to shell out a couple hundred dollars (or more) to learn the names of the notes.

, There are also some links below, but if you're looking for information on a certain aspect of music theory or aren't satisfied with the listed links, search engines like Google can be a huge help.

, You'll want to look over the search results, omit ones that cost money, look like a scam to you, or don't suit your learning tastes. A good website to learn music theory from will be geared towards your experience and age level, will be easy for you to read, and will allow you to take things at your own pace.

, Many sites will offer self-check quizzes after every lesson or unit of lessons, and you can use these to see how well you're picking this up. You may also wish to practice in real life. You can try transposing a piece of music to a different key, you can take up an instrument like the piano (which is set up in a way that makes it very easy to see the notes and relationships between them) and learn along with your program, or you can even try your hand at composing.

, It won't always stick the first time, but that's the beauty of internet learning... you can revisit certain lessons again and again.

, Choose an instrument to study, improve your skills at your current one, start composing music, or just enjoy being more musically knowledgeable and experienced.

Learn the major scale on the piano.,
Understand how a chord gets its name count each note in the scale you just played.,
Learn about chord inversions.,
Learn the sevenths.,
Learn about minor chords.,
Learn about octave chords.,
Learn power chords.,
A diminished chord.,
Remember if you learn a new chord such as a Dsus4, said as D suspended fourth, that all you have to do is count to get a suspended fourth chord in another key.

",How to Learn Music Chords," This is a generic form of any major scale read in terms of half-steps or distance from one key to another. To play any major scale find a root note, or the key that the scale is based off of. Then go two half-steps to the right. Example: start on C and go two half-steps to the right and you are now on D. A whole scale goes: root, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, root. You can start this on any key.;
, It goes up to 8, which is an octave. A major chord of any key has a root the third of the major scale and the fifth of a major scale. So let's take the A major chord for example, you will play an ""A"", a ""C sharp"", and an ""E"". ""A"" is the root, ""C sharp"" is the third in the A major scale, and ""E"" is the fifth in the A major scale. Now you can find any major chord you want. With a little counting, that is.

, Inversions of chords aren't hard once you find the notes in a chord. So far if you play a major scale the root note is going to be where you started counting and the third and fifth of the scale is going to be to the right of the root note. Sometimes you need the fifth to the left of the root note or both the third and the fifth to the left of the root note. All you have to do is find the same notes and move them around on the keyboard and you have an inversion of that chord. For example, you make a D chord using the method above. You will have D where you started counting, F sharp next, then A. You can then move A in front of D and have a chord that reads, from left to right, A, D, and F sharp. You can also move F sharp in front and get a chord that is still D major but has F sharp, A, then D.

, The sevenths is a type of chord that has the notes of a major chord and the seventh note in the major scale of that chord. Lets stick with D major. The seventh of any scale is always one key directly to the left of the root so for D the seventh will be C sharp. In your chord you will now have D, F sharp, A, and C sharp. Inversions work similar to above all you have to do is add the seventh note.

, Normally when someone mentions a minor chord it affects the third of the chord. Lets take the C major chord, it has the note C, E, and G. To make a minor chord you will take the third note of the C major scale, which is E, and move it one half step directly to the left. Your chord now has C, D sharp can also be known as E flat, and G. You can do this to any other numbered note in the major scale except the forth and the first. If done to the forth it will become a major third and thus be redundant, if done to the first you will be changing the key of the chord or making it the major seventh of the scale.

, An octave chord has at least two of the same notes. So take a C major octave chord. It will have a C, an E, a G, and another C. It could also have an E, a G, a C, and another E, or a G, a C, an E, and another G. These being inversions of the same chord.

, Power chords are normally played on a guitar, but you can play them on the piano too. It is basically the first of a major scale(the root) and the fifth of that same major scale. It's only two notes so it's not that hard. It can also be thought of as a major chord only with the third of the chord gone.

, A diminished chord is the first of a major scale with a minor third and a minor fifth. Lets take a C chord. It has the notes C, E, and G. To make it a diminished C you would make the third or the E a minor third so D sharp also known as E flat, and you would make the fifth of the chord a minor fifth so G would now be F sharp, which can also be called G flat. Then you play it all together and you have C, D sharp, and F sharp.


This chord doesn't sound the best all by itself. It is meant for what is called a build up and the relief is a chord that sounds nicer by itself that is played right after. Try playing a diminished chord and then the major chord of the same key. You will be able to feel the relief of the major chord because of the tension of the diminished chord right before it. There are also other combinations of different chords that can be used to build up and relieve tension.

Listen to other great mixtapes as inspiration and to get an idea of what you can be accomplished.,
Decide on a theme or overall style of music you want on your mixtape.

,
Collect the music you want on your mixtape.,
Organize the music by BPM range (beats per minute) so you can visually see which songs are within beat match mixing range of each other.

,
Start off with a strong energetic vibe and a medium to fast pace and continuously build the energy throughout your mix.

,
Save slower songs for later on after you have established a rapport with your listener.,
Make sure every mix is flawless and as perfect as you can make it.,
Be creative with your mixing, take out and bring in songs in various ways, scratch out of certain songs, mix in acapella and instrumental blends, create your own remixes.

,
Pay attention to how certain songs react with other songs.,
Do a quick 3-4 song practice run to get yourself warmed up and test out your first few songs and test out your volume and equalizer settings.,
Once you get started don't stop mixing until you just can't anymore, even if you mess up, it's good practice to keep going so you can at least listen to your first pass and then decide what you want to do different the next time.,
Try creating it in parts.,
Try it in several tracks.,
An alternative to multi track recording is to create your remixes before making your mixtape.,
Listen.,
Go back through your mix and add in a few scratches if you want, also add in your theming if need be.

,
Add in your tags every few songs.,
Make sure your name tags are also mixed in properly.,
Along those same lines make sure your final output volume is as loud as it can be without distortion or skipping.,
You can use a Compression to bring up the lowest points in your music to a level that can be heard a little easier but don't overdo it with compression settings as this will take away the natural highs and lows experienced with quiet parts and loud parts of your music.,
Save all your settings then produce One master disc, listen to it on several different audio systems, including your car, your home audio and a few friends audio as well as your home studio or music studio's audio system to make sure the sound quality is where you want it to be.,
Track and chop it.,
When all the tracks have been created you can put them back together in your Audio Disc burning software and burn them onto your new Tracked out Master Disc.,
You will also want to create One version of your mixtape that is just One super long entire track that you can use to send as a download copy for I-Pods and Mp3 players as well as for use as an Online promotional tool.

,
For your master disc you will also want to set your burning software to its slowest most accurate setting.,
Listen to your master copy if there are small skips or glitches that are consistently in one spot you will need to go back and re-export whatever track they are on and then burn a new master disc with the new version of the fixed tracks.

,
Duplicate.,
Have a professional design Having a professional designer design your mixtape is another ultra important step that will help you stand out from the non serious mixtape DJs and make sure you project a professional image with every mixtape you sell or hand out.

,
Market your mixtape.,
Get out there and hustle, hustle, hustle.

",How to Make Great Mix Tapes,";
,, You might already have all the music, but isolating the music in One folder or One place is essential to keeping yourself focused on only what you really want in your mix.

,,, While it may be customary for DJs to start off nightclub nights slower and gradually build up the energy as the night goes along, on mixtapes it's essential to grab the attention of the listener early on, so start with medium high energy songs and build the energy and pace up to at least the halfway point on your mixtape before breaking it down to slower songs and rebuilding the energy again with the slower paced music.

, If you messed up a mix and it sounds like a train wreck, go back and redo your mixtape or redo the part you messed up. No matter how good the rest of your mixtape is if you have jacked up parts that's all anyone will remember.

,, Make sure the last words from one song matched up perfectly with the first words of the other song to almost create sentences and phrases that makes sense with each other. I.E. on The ""Badder than Bad"" you may have Michael Jackson's ""Blame It On The Boogie"" going into ""Dancing Machine"" where ""Blame It On The Boogie"" ends with ""My baby's always dancing"" which I sampled and looped to continue saying ""always dancing, always dancing, dancing, dancing"" leading right into the first words from Dancing machine ""Dancing, dancing, dancing, she's a dancing machine"" This way the songs don't just match beat wise but they match conceptually as well. These kind of creative mixes will help make your mixtape a great mixtape and help it stand out from other mixtapes out there.

, If you don't like how the mix sounds or how the songs work with each other change things around. Also use this time to modify your EQ settings and volume levels til they sound perfect. No matter how good your mixes are your mixtape will never be great if your sound quality is not as good as it can be.

, You may decide to just redo the same exact mix with maybe One or two songs changed out or simply decide to change the places where you start or stop a mix.

, Creating a mixtape can be a long endeavor, and during the process you may want to change directions. It's Ok to create it in parts. Create One half on One day listen to it decide on the direction you want to go with the second half then create the other half on another day.

, If a mix you want to create is too complex to do in One pass separate it out to several tracks and do it in Two or more passes. I.E. Record, then go back and rerecord over your original recording on a separate recording track. (you will need multi track capabilities for this as offered in 4 track recorders or on Audio production software like Cubase, Sony Acid, Pro tools etc).

, Then all you have to do is mix your already made remixes. Or create edits of songs that have an acapella trail out or an instrumental trail out instead of having them end the normal way.

, When you are finally finished recording your mixtape mix, it's time to go back and listen to the entire mix and note what you might want to add at certain points in the mix.

,, Adding your name into your mix is an important step that ensures that no other DJ can claim your mixtape mix as their own. This step also ensures that people know who created the mixtape and if you also include your website in a few of your tags they will also know where they can get it from. This is especially important if people will be using your mixtape to play at parties, for outings in the car with friends or for social functions or during the early part of nightclub nights where others will also be listening. Some DJs overdo this and it becomes blatantly annoying. Don't yell your name over songs, only put your name tags over instrumental beds and quiet parts or transitions, most importantly don't yell over the lyrics of a song!

, Don't have them way louder than the music, they should not detract from your mix but sound like they belong and are part of the overall mix.

, For Cassette tapes this meant going above the 0db (0 Decibel) line by maybe a +1 to +2 red zone. For Digital production onto CD however this is not the case. You must keep yourself below the 0 db or you will distort and have pops or skips on your CD. The optimal range is -2db to -3db for your overall sound and maybe peaking a few times at -1 or -2db on your loudest sounds. That means bringing up your music to consistently hit this range and occasionally letting a few things go just barely above that.

, You want your soft quiet parts to be heard but still be distinguishable as a quiet part of a song. If you bring up the quiet parts too much and reduce the loud parts too much it makes for a bland and dry mix that has no ups and downs in sound and emotion.

, If there are a few things that need to be tweaked like adding in a little more Bass or a little more mid-range etc go back and add the settings to correct the sound and create another master disc, repeat this process until you have it sounding the way you want it.

, Once you have your mixtape sounding the way you want it's time to track it out and chop it up into separate tracks. Since this is a continuous mix you will have to manually insert track markers and export each marked section into a separate track. This process will be different for each program. In Cubase you manually have to write in the start and end times for every track and make sure that you use the same exact numbers from the end of One track as the number that begins the next track. Make sure you write down the start and end times of each track in case you have to do anything more than once and also to ensure no mistakes are made during this crucial step.

, Remember that this is supposed to be a continuous mix with no pauses or gaps, so make sure you have your CD burning software set to do a gapless album. Tell the software not to insert any gaps between tracks.

,, Copies can be made full speed but your master disc needs to be burned as slow as possible to reduce the chance of small errors that will the be copied to all your other discs. Also make sure you burn more than One copy of your master disc direct from the program.

,, Once the master is as good as it is ever going to be it's time to start duplicating your CDs. You're best bets are professional duplication or either owning or knowing someone that owns a professional 11CD duplication tower or automatic CD duplication machine. Trust me, burning CDs One at a time is way too time consuming and ineffective.

,, Marketing your mixtape is the next logical step. If you believe you have created a great mixtape that is newsworthy, then it must be heard. Send it to local and national magazines, websites, blogs and newspapers that are at least slightly related to your style of music, to DJs, to the mixtape industry in general.

Use words and phrases your audience understands.,
Be concise and talk about what’s important to your audience.,
Ask your audience what they want to hear from you.",How to Know Your Audience," Instead of using an acronym or technical jargon, use a relevant word or phrase that provides the same meaning. For example, business people like to use SME’s (pronounced like ""smees"") to describe a person who is a Subject Matter Expert. The time you save by saying “SMEES” is lost when it causes an unfamiliar listener to try to figure out what you mean. Just say “Subject Matter Expert” or “Expert” or “Business Owner” or something to describe the same thing. If you cause your audience to have to think about your last words then they will stop listening until they figure out what you meant.;
, If you have the opportunity to discuss a topic that you know a lot about, it is easy to talk at a level of detail that nobody can follow (or care about) except you. People typically only care that the overall process works, not how it works. In sales you talk about benefits with the assurance that the product works, not the features or how it works. Eventually the question will come up where you can bring up the details but that should be based on knowing that your audience wants those details.

, The titles people give you in introducing themselves at the beginning of a meeting may be impressive, but not necessarily indicative of what they care about. Don’t rely on their role or title. Instead ask how much detail your audience wants from you. This will not only help you earn their respect it also helps you stay on time and on track.

Write songs.,
Choose your best songs.,
Decide where your band is going to record.,
You can record at your home studio.,
Or you can record at a professional recording studio.,
Keep the tracks down to two or three, nobody will listen to your demo CD if you provide your epic 20-track mega collection that has ten minute solos on each track.

",How to Make a Demo CD," Your demo needs at least two songs. You can add more if you like, but don't overdo it. No one's gonna listen to a demo with 20 songs. They can be original or cover songs but at least a couple of them should be original.;
, Best doesn't mean your most popular songs, it's your best. - The best performed, best sung, best written, with the strongest chorus and the best structure and format. They should all be in the same style. To choose your best songs, don't ask your fans. They most likely don't know much about composition and arrangement. Besides, they're gonna say they're all great, because they're your fans, remember?! Instead, you should ask someone more in the industry, such as your manager, a publisher, a band that has a record deal, a lawyer and if you can't find any of these try asking a local club owner, a DJ, or a small record store manager.

, The general dilemma is cost. If you want to record for $500 to no money, you can record at your home studio. If you're ready to spend more, you should go to a recording studio, because it will be better quality. If you're going to record at your home studio, read step four. If you're going to record at a professional studio, read step five

,



Obtain some recording software. Audacity is a great program which you can get for free at . If you can afford it, buy Pro Tools, Cubase, or the software that comes with your sound interface.

Make sure you have the hardware Mics, amps, an audio interface, a mixer (if you can) and lots of cables!

Keep it as simple as possible. You can record guitars and bass directly or by miking the amp with one microphone. Vocals can be recorded directly too. The several drum mics can be run through a mixer and then through the interface. For best recording quality (and just if you already have one) run instruments/mics into a preamp, between the mixer and the interface.
Learn to record into an .mp3 or .wav file.

Record the drums first. The rest come easier with more precision.


,



Look for small studios. Some of them will do anything for your business, with some of the studios charging as little as $100 dollars a song. Since your demo will have about three songs, that equals to just $300 for the whole CD!

"
Round up a small group of musicians.,
Discuss the chord structure or key of the song.,
Play through the melody of the song 1-2 times so that everyone feels comfortable.,
Keep your head up as you play.,
Feel the vibe of the song as it grows.,
Improvise on the song when it's your turn.,
Share the spotlight.,
Decide as a group when to end the song.",How to Jam1," You only need one other musician to jam with, but it is usually best to have at least one rhythm player (drums or percussion) and 1-2 other melody instruments (guitars, bass). While there is no law saying that you can't jam with 15 other people, jam groups generally stay smaller so that every musician can listen in and play off of every other musician. A small group of 3-4 similarly skilled musicians is a good place to start.


That said, there are many long-standing groups, such as blues bands, drum groups, and bluegrass bands, that have enormous, open jams, inviting a wide variety of skills and styles. Jamming is non-judgmental and free-form, so just have fun.
If you're just starting to improvise, jumping into a large jam session is a great way to get your feet wet without a ton of pressure, as any mistakes you make are less likely to get noticed.;
, Think of this as the guiding principle of the song. While there will likely be some improvisation and exploration, everyone needs to understand the chords in order to stay together. In general, most jams stick to simple, 3-4 chord songs or melodies that everyone already knows. The point of a jam is not to show off complex, interlocked instrumentals, but to allow each musician the freedom to experiment.


Jams can either play established songs, such as the blues jam classic ""Stormy Monday,"" or quickly improvised chord groupings. If you're confused, let someone pick a song and the chords and go from there.
If you don't know the chords, sit back and watch another instrument or ask someone playing for advice.If you're a percussionist you should ask about the tempo, or set the tempo yourself if you know the skill levels of your fellow musicians.

, In general, you play through the song ""as written"" briefly, sometimes with vocals, so that everyone gets used to the feel of the song. If you're improvising the song on the spot, this is a good way to get everyone on the same page. Keep the first minute or two simple so that everyone can get used to the structure. Once everyone is on the same page the fun can begin.

, More often than not, one or two people will emerge as the ""leaders"" of the jam, keeping everyone on time and noting when people should take solos. As you play, keep your head up and watch the other musicians keep the band together. Eye contact, brief signaling, and even talking about upcoming chords or changes will help everyone stay on the same page.


As you get more comfortable with your fellow musicians, you can often hear when there is space for a solo and when the rhythm is changing, but you should still be looking up for visual cues from time to time.
Watch any improvisational or jam band play live -- you'll notice small moments when the musicians make eye contact through the show, usually before changes, solos, or the song's end., If everyone else starts playing fewer notes, calming the energy down, come down with them. If things start to pick up in volume and intensity, let your own volume grow slowly. In most jams, no one instrument is supposed to take over the entire song. Each player needs to be aware of the rest of the band so that the song grows organically. While you play, listen to the entire sound of the band, not just your own instrument.


If you're struggling to keep up with every musician, hone in on the drummer. Follow his lead in energy, tempo, and sound.
Feel free to adjust your playing, tempo, or melody, as long as it fits in with the rest of the band. You can help push the song in new directions as long as you don't try and take over the song.

, Musical improvisation takes a lifetime to master, so you're not expected to whip out a world-class solo on the fly. Improvisation is your chance to see where your instrument takes you, so relax and start experimenting. As long as you remember to stay in key, there is no wrong way to improvise, so just let go and have some fun.If you're new to improv, find a 4-5 note line you like and play it once or twice. Then start to adjust it, changing 1-2 notes each time you play it so you get variations on the same simple theme. If you can mimic the vocal line or a common melody, you'll be sure to keep the song moving.
Don't feel the need to show off or be the best. Just play what sounds good to you., A jam is supposed to be an egalitarian, communal environment where everyone can feel free to let loose. No one enjoys it, however, when one person takes all the solos, or decides to solo for 2-3 minutes straight. If you're unsure what the protocol is, just listen into the other plays as they take solos or features. When your turn comes up, play for the same amount of bars (usually eight) as everyone else.


That said, some rock and roll groups, usually small, guitar driven bands, will jam on 4-5 minutes solos (see The Grateful Dead, Phish, etc.). It is more about feeling the mood in your particular jam than adhering to a hard and fast rule.

, Once everyone's taken a solo, most musicians will start looking around for a cue when to end. In general, once all the musicians have made eye contact, someone will say or signal for ""one more round"" or to move to the outro, if the song has one. This helps everyone come to an end at the same moment.


As the song ends, cut the number of notes or beats you play in half to ease out of the song. It also makes it easier to stop on a dime if you miss the ending cue.

Jam along to your favorite songs at home.,
Learn the ""standards"" in your genre.,
Know your instrument.,
Learn a few common chord structures.,
Learn music theory.",How to Jam2," One of the best ways to learn to jam is to put on your favorite CD's and just start playing. This helps you train your ear to quickly pick up chord changes, rhythm, and melody, even if you don't necessarily know the song well. Improvisation is a skill that only comes through practice, but that doesn't mean you need a full band with you every time you want to play.


Remember to learn the rhythm and backing parts of the songs as well, not just the solos. To succeed in a jam, you need to be a part of the band as well as a willing improviser.
If you play with several musicians regularly, ask them for 4-5 songs that they want you to learn, and offer them a few you like to play. The next time you meet your band will have a few more songs to jam on., If you're going to a gospel/bluegrass jam, you need to know how to play ""I'll Fly Away"" and a Johnny Cash song or two. If you're going to a rock or blues jam, you need to know the classic 12-bar blues format (""Stormy Monday,"" ""Everyday I Get the Blues""), and a few Beatles or Rolling Stones songs that everyone knows. If you're a jazz musician, you should have ""Summertime,"" ""Heart and Soul,"" ""Bye Bye Blackbird,"" ""Round Midnight"" and several other jazz classics down pat.Don't feel like you need to memorize tons of songs before you're able to jam. As you start playing, note the songs that come up frequently and make a point to learn them back to front. In many cases, jamming on a song is actually the best, and fastest, way to learn a song., You should be able to find most notes on your instrument with ease. If you know where everything is you'll be able to quickly learn from others while jamming, picking up new melodies and chords for songs you don't know so well. You need to spend plenty of time practicing on your own, not just showing up and trying to wing it. The better you know your instrument, the more you can stop thinking and start playing.

, You will never know every single chord or song that someone suggests, but having a good mental catalog of songs will help you quickly adapt to whatever song is being played. While it is by no means exhaustive, there are some common chord structures that any band could start with:


A - D - E (Frequently in 7ths for blues songs)
G - C - D
C - F - G
G - Am - D
C - Am - Dm - G, While studying theory may seem like the antithesis of good improvisers, quality musicians know that music theory is the secret weapon that helps them adapt in any jam. Knowing song, chord, and scale structures allows you to figure out songs on the fly because you can quickly predict where the song is going. Chords are not smashed together randomly -- there are certain principles and formulas that dictate what sounds good together and how each scale interacts with certain chords. If you want to be a quality jam-player, you need to do your homework."

, It is a good idea to start simple and as you get more comfortable with more complicated progressions.

, As the jam progresses the percussion will build up in complexity and intensity bringing the entire band with it.

Create your own steps.",How to Do the Hand Jive," The first movement in the hand jive is to bend slightly at the waist and pat your hands on your thighs twice. After patting your thighs, stand up and clap your hands twice.


Instead of patting your thighs, you can also try patting your knees. Choose the motion that is most comfortable for you.;
, Standing up straight, cross your right hand over your left hand. After you have crossed your hands, immediately open them again in a quick motion. Both of your palms should be facing the ground. Your hands should not touch each other, but instead, glide past each other in the air. Complete this motion twice. Then cross your left hand over your right in the exact same way. Again, complete this motion twice.

, The next move is to make your hands into two vertical fists, as if you were grabbing a pole. Place your right fist over your left fist and knock them together twice. Then put your left fist over your right fist and knock them together twice.


This motion is sometimes called the hammer because you are hamming your fists together.

, Following the hammer motion, give a thumbs-up sign with both of your hands. Then, beginning with your right hand, point your thumb backwards over your right shoulder twice. This should look almost like you're hitch-hiking. Then complete the same movement with your left arm.

, Once you have learned the basic movements, try practicing them in order. Continue to practice until you have memorized the routine and find the movements easy to perform. This should take 5 to 10 minutes depending on your age and dance background. The great thing about the hand jive is that it is a relatively easy dance to learn!


Use this video to help you learn and practice the dance: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5FXpc1nPr0


, The hand jive becomes even more fun if you practice the movements to music. Usually the hand jive is performed to the following songs: “Willie and the Hand Jive,” or “Born to Hand Jive.” Both of these songs have been recorded by multiple different artists over the years. For example, the song “Born to Hand Jive” was popularized in the hit movie Grease.Although these songs are most commonly used for the hand jive, you can perform the dance moves to almost any song.
Try choosing an upbeat song that you enjoy and see how it looks.
Avoid slow ballads. The jive is supposed to be relatively quick and works best with songs that have a faster beat.

, Once you are completely comfortable with the hand motions and you have memorized the entire routine, you are ready to try the dance to music. The hand jive lasts for 16 beats (2 sets of 8 counts). In order to perform the movements to music you should count out the 16 beats as your are going through the motions.


For example, when you pat your thighs twice count in your head 1...2 to the beat of the music. Then when you clap your hands count in your head 3...4, when you cross your hands (right over left) count 5…6, and then when you cross your hands (left over right) count 7...8.
Once you get to 8 counts, you should start over at 1 again. This means when you pound your fists (right over left) you will count 1...2, and then when you pound your fists again (left over right) you will count 3...4, followed by thumbs up over the right shoulder and count 5…6, and finally thumbs up over the left shoulder and count 7...8.

, The hand jive can also be sped up or slowed down depending on your ability and comfort level. If you want to be challenged while jiving, you can perform the hand jive at double time. This means that the entire jive would only take 1 count of 8 instead of 2. For example, when you pat your thighs twice it would only take up 1 count and you would say 1. Then when you clap your hands twice you would say 2 etc. The beat of the song will stay the same, but you will be performing the motions much faster (i.e. double the speed).


If you are already finding the jive difficult, you can also try slowing down the movement. Instead of taking 16 beats (2 sets of 8 counts) you can take 32 beats (4 sets of 8 counts). This means that you would double all of the movements. For example, instead of patting your legs twice, you would pat them 4 times. Continue the dance by doubling all of the movements.

, Over the years the hand jive has been modified for various different performances and shows. For example, in 2015 “Grease: Live!” starring Julianne Hough and Carly Rae Jepson updated the dance for a modern viewing audience. In this version of the jive they have removed the hand crossing portion of the dance and replaced it with two flicks of the hands to the right followed be two flicks to the left.Similarly, there are other versions that include a hand roll instead of the hand crossing section.

, If you feel at ease performing the hand jive in a stationary position, you can also try moving the rest of your body to the music. For example, you could try bopping to the beat of the music, and moving around while performing the hand jive. If you are feeling really creative, you could add in some footwork steps to make the dance even more dynamic and difficult.Remember to always choreograph the moves to counts of 8 in order to stay in time with the music.

, The hand jive is essentially a series of steps that involve moving your arms, and clapping and patting different parts of your body. In many ways, you can think of it as a more advanced form of patty-cake. You can try making your own version of the dance by adding in a series of claps and movements to make it more unique. Dancing is a form of artistic expression so there is always room to show your own personality through the movement of your body. Remember to be creative and have fun!

, You should keep the manual handy for easy reference.

, Examine the notes (are they mostly whole, half, quarter, eighth, etc...?), the time signature (4/4, 2/4, 6/8...), and the tempo.

, Most metronomes offer quarter notes, eighth notes, and sixteenth notes, as well as some other strange combinations. Unless you are playing a very complicated song that is mostly eighth or sixteenth notes, you should choose the quarter note setting, as it will help you count half and whole notes, too.

, Most metronomes offer 1 - 9. This is simple, just see the top number in your time signature.

, Usually, somewhere between 80 and 125 BPM works well. Figure out how fast the music is before setting the BPM. To experiment, set the tempo around 100 BPM and see if the song sounds right. If not, fix it.

, If the music is loud (forte or louder), choose a loud voice, like clapping, although ticking is most common.

Repeat the pattern and pass off your cup for group play.",How to Do the Cup Game," You'll want a fairly sturdy cup to play the cup game with. Plastic cups make a great sound when hit and clapped on the table, but be sure if you're using a plastic cup that it's strong enough to withstand the game. Otherwise you might break the cup over the course of your game.


If playing with a plastic cup, take it in your hand and squeeze it gently. If it feels like it is brittle or might break, you may want to get a different cup.
Glass or ceramic cups can break while playing the cup game. This can lead to cuts, so if you plan on using a glass or ceramic cup, it should be very sturdy.
Some glass and ceramic cup can make a bright, pleasing sound when clapped to the table.;
, When playing the cup game you'll be tapping on the surface in front of you, clapping the cup to the surface, and sliding your cup back and forth. You'll want to make sure that objects that might get in your way, like your lunch or a beverage, are safely out of the way before playing.


Table cloths can make it difficult for you to slide your glass while playing the cup game. Depending on the cup you are using and the heaviness of the tablecloth, you may want to remove the cloth before play.
Be sure your flat surface is stable! A card table or a poorly supported table might not be able to withstand the claps, taps, and slaps of the cup game.

, The starting position for your cup will be directly in front of you. Your hands should be at the to either side of the cup, ready to both clap and move the cup while playing the cup game., This is optional, but a song can help you stay in sync with other people when you are playing with your friends. ""When I'm Gone"" is the song performed by Anna Kendrick while playing the cup game, but you might find the rhythms of other songs work just as well.You might sing the song that is credited as the origin of the cup song, ""Screen Door"" by Rich Mullens., Your hands should be to either side of your cup, and your cup should be directly in front of you on a flat, stable surface. Take your hands and clap twice over the cup., Once you have clapped, you're going to do a three-beat drum roll on the top of your cup with your finger(s). This will make a hollow, rhythmic sound from your cup that will break up your clapping. Tap the top of the cup three times: right hand, left hand, right hand.Left-handers should tap the bottom of the cup similarly, using the tapping pattern left-right-left.
Tap the cup rapidly with your fingers to add variety between the slower rhythms of your claps and your faster, lighter taps.

, After you have finished your drum roll taps on the top of the cup, you should clap once more above the cup to the beat of the music. If there is no music, simply clap in a steady, rhythmic fashion.

, After your clap, you'll need to swiftly pick up your cup with your right hand. Staying in rhythm with the beat of your claps and taps, firmly clap the cup back down onto the table about 6 inches (15 cm) to the right of its starting position.Left-handers should perform this motion similarly, picking up the cup with the left hand and then placing it back down onto the table about 6 inches (15 cm) to the left of its starting position.
You shouldn't need to raise your cup any more than 2 inches (5 cm) from the table.
Your cup should remain upside down while tapping it to the table.

, Clap once, loudly, and then reach with your right hand to retrieve the cup from the table. When grabbing the cup, your hand should be on the inside of the cup, and your thumb pointed toward the table.



Left-handers should pick up the cup with their left hand.

, With your right hand clap the mouth of the cup against your left palm. Then, knock the bottom of the cup quickly and lightly against the table. This should create a staccato bounce of the cup between your left palm to the table.



Left-handers should clap the cup to their right palm, and then knock the bottom of the cup against the table in the same fashion employed by right-handers.
You should not let go of the cup at this point., Use your right hand to lift the cup and clap its bottom against the palm of your left hand. After you clap, you'll want to hold onto the cup with your left hand and release with your right.



Left-handers should clap the bottom of the cup with their right hand and then transfer the cup from their left to right hand., With your now free right hand, slap the table a little to the left of directly in front of you. After that, use your left hand to clap the cup against the table a little to the right of directly in front of you.



Left-handers will mirror these ending motions so that their left hand slaps the table a little to the right of directly in front of them, the right hand claps the cup to the table a little to the left of directly in front of them, both arms crossing in front.
After returning the cup to the table, your arms should be crossed in front of you, your right hand to the left, your left hand to the right and still holding the cup.
Return your hands to either side of the cup to prepare to repeat the game from the beginning.
You can continue playing the cup game for as long as the music plays, or for as long as you wish., The traditional version of this game has each cupper pass their cup to the cupper on their right. As you play, you should increase the speed at which you play the cup game. Any players who fumble or drop the cup should step out of the group until only one winner remains."

, The chin rest is a round shaped pad that will be found either on the right side or the middle of your viola. Lean the left side of your jaw onto it. Ensure that the viola is comfortably between your chin and left shoulder/collar bone.

, You should keep your viola at 45 degree angle. Do this so that the instrument’s strings are accessible at all times. For a good measure, figure out if the slope of your viola is parallel with the ground. If the instrument is too low, you will have to move your hands further to reach it.

, Your body should be supporting it. The neck of your viola should rest in the gap between your left thumb and index finger. This position will allow your fingers to move easily and hover over the strings comfortably.

Look through the rest of the part you have to harmonize, work out possible chords, and lightly pencil them in, starting with the cadences, and then move on to the remaining chords.,
Fill in the rest of the chords.,
Go through and try to put in any suspensions (the most common are 4-3 in the Alto at a cadence and a 7-6 in the Tenor in the middle) and dissonances such as 7ths.,
Go through and check all pairs of voices making sure that the two parts never move up or down in perfect fifths, octaves, or in unison.,
Play it (or get someone to play it for you) on a piano and listen carefully.",How to Harmonise a Chorale in the Style of Bach," Chorale melodies were sung by a congregation in Lutheran churches in parts of Germany. The melodies are recognisable, and are divided into phrases, which are identified by pause marks. These marks indicate where you should put your cadences.;
, Find the key of the piece and other parts to distinguish possible points of modulation (you will want to modulate at least 2-3 in your chorale)

, This will normally be a perfect authentic cadence (V-I with both chords in root position), though one shouldn't rule out the possibility of plagal (IV-I) cadences though this is extremely rare.

, Each chord must contain the root (which is often doubled), the third and the fifth.

, They should fit into the chorale melody, and have logical chord progressions. Most chorales have similar cadential progressions. The best progressions could include a cycle of fifths (vi-ii7b-V7-I), or a cadential 6-4 ((ii7b)-Ic-V7-I).

, Remember that these must all be prepared and resolved. (Although a 7th does not have to be prepared it it falls on the second quaver of a beat.) Also add in any passing notes, anticipation notes and echappe notes that you can. These add more style and sophistication to the chorale.

, Bach occasionally used parallel 5ths or octaves, but they are rare and hidden with the skill of an expert. Also, check that the Alto part does not go higher than the Soprano part in any chords, and same with Tenor and Alto and Bass and Tenor.

, If there are any chords that sound dissonant or wrong then rework them. This may affect other chords near it so double check for fifths or octaves again.

If you'd like to eventually play classical, art music, or jazz, it's important to pick up an instrument in the classical string category, a woodwind, brass, or percussion instrument. These players generally dedicate lots of time and scholarship to learning their instrument.
If you want to write your own songs and play pop music, it's usually best to pick up a guitar, bass guitar, piano, or learn to play the drum kit. While it's great to take lessons, lots of pop and folk musicians are self-taught, using DIY books, YouTube videos, and good old-fashioned trial and error.;
, Even if you don't envision yourself being a concert pianist doing recitals in a tux, one of the best ways to build a good foundation as a musician is to learn piano. Because all the notes are laid out in front of you, piano makes an excellent first instrument, popular with young children and beginners. It's also one of the most versatile instruments, played in classical, pop, and many other styles of music.


Real upright or concert pianos can be expensive, but electric keyboards come at a variety of prices, from affordable to very professional and expensive. The great thing about piano is that you can learn the necessary fingerings and fundamentals regardless of the quality of the piano you're playing.

, Used in concert music, jazz, pep bands, swing bands, and other types of sheet-music played by instrumentalists, classical instruments refer to the many different varieties of instruments played in organized professional bands that play something other than pop music. If you love complicated, artistic, and sophisticated music and history, learning one of these instruments would be appropriate for you.


While they're not actually made of brass anymore, brass instruments are made of winding metal tubes that you blow through to create a tone.
Woodwinds are made of composite materials and are played by vibrating a reed that's held in a mouthpiece. Producing a distinctive warm and woody sound, woodwinds are used in classical music and jazz, and saxophones are used often in pop music.
Pick up a classical string. Used in orchestras, string quartets, and other types of professional ensembles, violins, violas, double-basses, and cellos form the foundation of the classical strings. Guitars could also be considered a classical string, depending on the style of music.

, While all these instruments can be used to play a variety of styles and sounds, when we think of playing pop music or starting a band of our own, we usually think of guitar, bass guitar, drums, and keyboards or piano. If you're less interested in being the kind of musician who plays in a tuxedo at a concert hall and more interested in being in a garage band that tours around in a van, these might be the right instruments for you.

, Percussion is so much more than background. Good percussionists drive the music forward in every variety of music, from folk to classical, from jazz to rock and roll. There's nothing more versatile and essential to a group of musicians than a talented percussionist keeping time.


One of the best things about percussion is that you can start building the skills without any kind of instrument at all. If you have an internal sense of time and the ability to keep a steady beat with your hands, consider learning percussion.

, From digital DJs to synth wizards, the traditional definition of what it means to be a ""musician"" is much larger than it used to be. Just as much complex and artistic music can be made by pushing buttons on a laptop just as it can by operating the valves on the trumpet, and just as legitimately.

, Even if you have a natural talent for a certain instrument, there's a difference between ""playing an instrument"" and ""being a musician."" That difference involves practice. Musicians are dedicated to improve their skills and learn new techniques and more complicated music on the instrument they've chosen. The only way to do that is regular and serious practice.


Develop good practice habits and routines for yourself. Always practice using good posture, warm up beforehand, and try practicing for at least 20-40 minutes each day. Practice a mixture of techniques, skills, and fun activities. For every scale you learn, take the time to mess around learning the Star Wars theme or some other fun song.
Like when you exercise your body, consistency is very important. Try to practice every day, so you can maintain the good habits that you're building and develop them.

, It's very difficult to learn music from a book alone. While written tutorials can be helpful, there's no substitute for in-person, one-on-one instructions that come from lessons with a good teacher. A teacher can help to correct your technique and build the fundamentals necessary to be a great player, whatever instrument you play.


If you want to become a musician, it's very important that you be teachable. Hard-headed people who can't take criticism don't have much of a future as musicians. Listen closely to what good players say, follow directions, and learn everything you can. Make it your goal to get better.
If you don't have the time or money to have a formal teacher-student relationship, find musicians who are better than you to play with. Evening jam sessions on the porch with a couple of guitars can be a great way to improve your skills. Watch and learn.

, While you can play by ear, it can be good if you can learn how to read sheet music, and is absolutely essential for certain instruments and styles. If you want to play classical music, it's almost impossible to learn by ear and rote memorization.


Also, learn musical history and some theory if you hope to compose your own music one day. Learning why certain notes sound good together, how to make a chord, and how music actually works is the best way to improve as an instrumentalist and as a composer, whatever instrument you play.

, Developing your own taste in music is critical for musicians. Just like a novelist has to read a wide variety of novels and learn about the history of literature to write something worth reading, a musician needs to listen to a wide variety of music and learn to appreciate different styles of music, if you ever want to write something worth hearing, or play music that deserves to be heard.


Listen to classical music, starting with old court-based consort music and moving your way up through the romantic composers like Mozart and Beethoven. Try listening to the 20th century avant-garde composers like Penderecki and Cage to challenge your conceptions of what music is.Listen to rock music, of all strains, even if it's not your cup of tea. Check out early punk, rockabilly, and psychedelic nuggets. Listen to what's popular and what's not. Try to find something worth listening to and ignore the rest.
When you find something you like, look back to the influences. If you like Katy Perry, you might find out that Cher and Madonna are huge influences on her style and sound. When you listen to Cher, you might work your way back to Etta James, and eventually work your way back to Bessie Smith, one of the greatest early blues singers of all time. Find the roots of your favorite artists.

, To grow as a musician and to take your skills to the next level, it's a great idea to give composition a shot. Whether you play classically or play pop music, writing your own songs can help you see the difference between playing notes and making music much more quickly than almost anything else. Take the responsibility to write the notes you play.

, Miles Davis could never nail the horn technique of vibrato while learning to play his horn, so he built a whole career around a singular, sonorous, clean tone that never wavered. When asked why his band played so chuggingly, like a freight train, Johnny Cash responded, ""We'd play faster if we could."" Recast your supposed weaknesses as individual quirks and strengths and use them to become an individual player.

, Playing with other instrumentalists and musicians can give you the skills you need to improve, learning their specific tricks of the trade, as well as giving you the opportunity to respond to play as a unit, making music as one.


If you want to play classical music or organized concert music, it's important to join a community band, a school band, or some other organized music group.
Playing with others is also a good way to keep your ego in check. David Hood, part of the Muscle Shoals recording studio and one of the greatest session bass players of all time, was once asked how he got such a great reputation as as reliable player and he said, ""My gear always worked and I was always on time."" Humility serves musicians well.

, If you've been practicing your instrument on a regular basis and want to take it to the next level, it might be time to take your show public. Start by playing your best material in front of a few close and forgiving friends, or your parents, and start playing for other people. If you want to be a performer, you require an audience.


Coffee shop open-mics are a great way to find a forgiving audience who'll be warm and accepting. Most open-mics are full of hobbyists who want to get started and most crowds are friendly and easy-going. It's a great way to crack in.
Alternatively, just play for yourself. There's nowhere it says you have to ever play in front of anyone. Learn to play and enjoy the sounds you make for yourself.

, Having trouble finding an established group or band to play with? Start your own. Don't wait around for other musicians to come to you, go out and find them. Put an add up on Craigslist with your biggest influences and your desire to play with a group that plays a particular kind of music and vet the other players who get in touch. Hang around the local music shops and put up ads for players. Go to open-mics and make contacts with other local musicians who can play., Getting a recording of yourself playing can be one of the most rewarding and fun things for a young musician. Being able to actually hear yourself playing over the speakers? Nothing cooler. And these days, it's easier than ever to record yourself quickly and easily at home, and to have it sound great.


Invest in a few cheap microphones to get started and record yourself directly to your computer using GarageBand or Audacity. Set the levels like you like them and burn CDs for your friends, or put them on your iPod.
If you're feeling really ambitious, you can share you recordings with the world. Record your best stuff and start a Bandcamp page or a Soundcloud account to give out quick links to your tunes.

, Even if you're talented, even if you're a hard worker, even if you're the best banjo picker in your town, it's possible that you'll struggle to be heard. Being a musician can be a slog for a lot of people, and it can take a long time before the fruits of your labor start to pay off, both in terms of skill building and getting any kind of recognition, much less money. The more dedicated you are, however, the bigger chance you give yourself for success.


Consider going to music school if you want to make contacts and receive individualized training on your instrument. Even if you don't want to play classical, learning the skills of music production and history can give you an edge in the music business.

Fall in love with hip-hop.,
Listen to a wide array of music.,
Learn music theory and history.,
Buy beat-making equipment.,
Choose audio production software.,
Experiment with sounds and equipment.",How to Become a Hip Hop Music Producer1," Know before you begin that the music industry is notoriously difficult to break into, so you need to be pursuing hip-hop because you love it, not to make a quick buck. Listen to as many rappers and producers as you can, discovering what sounds you love and what style of music you want to make. The more you know about hip-hop, the better equipped you will be to make it.


Hip-hop is one of the easiest genres to get into, thanks to the wide variety of free music available at mixtape websites like Datpiff, LiveMixtapes, and HotNewHipHop.;
, Hip-hop producers are famous for pulling diverse musical influences and trends together to create something new, so look for good music wherever you can find it. RZA and got famous digging through old soul albums, Russell Simmons and Rick Rubin made waves bringing rock & roll into rap, and Kanye uses a full classical orchestra behind many of his beats. There is no genre that you cannot find inspiration in as a hip-hop producer.


Listen to music for it's quality, not because of it's genre or reputation.
Keep notes of music you like so you can find it, and potentially use it, later.

, Production is the process of creating an instrumental track, but in the case of hip-hop you will usually be ""playing"" all of the instruments. To have full control over your sound you need to know how music works, including time signatures, chord progression, music theory, and instrumentation. Learn how to play an instrument. Since many beats are made with a keyboard, try starting with a piano.

, Hip-hop has a low barrier to entry because you can theoretically make beats with nothing more than a reasonably powerful computer. These days, extra tools can plug right into your computer to give you even greater control over your music, however, and are nearly invaluable.



Keyboards: Perhaps the second most important tool next to a computer, keyboards allow you to create your own melodies and physically play your beat, which is usually much faster than inputting the notes into the computer.

Drum Machines: incredibly versatile rhythm instruments, drum machines let you assign any sound you want to a small pad then play that sound as if it was a drum. You can program it with drums, cymbals, percussion instruments, notes, or even random sounds.

Microphone: Essential if you want to record vocal tracks, microphones also let you record other instruments and sounds to incorporate into your beats.

MIDI Controllers: Complex but powerful, MIDI controllers give you the ability to adjust tone, rhythm, loops, drums, and beats with the touch of a button. Many high-end keyboards and drum machines come with attached MIDI Controllers.

Speakers: Be sure to invest in good speakers so you can hear your music at the highest possible quality, that way you can be sure your listeners are hearing what you want them to hear. , Known as a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW), there are hundreds options out there. While there is a lot of variability in features, usability, and reliability, most of them are pretty similar in execution. Different instrument parts are dragged into a timeline where they can be layered, edited, and repeated to form your song. Choose the program you are most comfortable with and learn everything you can about it.


Some free programs to begin practicing on are Audacity, GarageBand (Mac), Cecilia, and Mixx.
For more committed beatmakers, check out paid programs like Pro Tools, Logic, MuTools, MixCraft, or Cubase. Every software has tons of tutorials, tips, and tricks available online, and you should learn as much about your DAW as you possibly can.

, This is the only way to get familiar with your equipment and to learn what kind of music you'd like to make. Make as many beats as you can, even if they are only 30 seconds long, and dig into all of the instruments you have access to.


Try recreating some of your favorite beats. You can download packs of sounds that famous producers use online and play with them to see how they're used.

Refine your beats.,
Break all the rules.",How to Become a Hip Hop Music Producer2," The drums are the most important part of your beat and form the structure to the entire song. Especially in hip-hop, where singers need a steady rhythm to rap over, you need to create a solid foundation for melody, vocals, and orchestration.


Start with the classic trio of drum beats -- kick drum, snare, and hi-hat. Play with these three drums to produce the bouncy, up-tempo feel of classic rap and hip-hop songs. Ex. DJ Premier's famous beats on the album Step in the Arena. Download free drum packs online to find unique percussion and sounds the incorporate into your songs.
Experiment with other sounds for percussion. Producers such as J Dilla (Ex. ""Waves"") became famous for using voices, sirens, pops, and other noises in place of drums. (Ex. 50 Cent's ""Heat"" uses gun noises for percussion)

, Hip-hop has it's roots in jazz, funk, and soul, and just like the genres that spawned it, all hip-hop tracks require two basic instruments: drums and bass. A bass line gives your song a basic template for the melody


Bass lines can be a simple, like Nas' ""Memory Lane (Sittin' in the Park),"" or complex, like Common's ""Be (Intro).""
Practice meshing the bass line with your kick drum, as they both emit low frequency notes. Layer them so you can hear both, like in the songs above. , Once you've established the ""groove"" of the song with bass and drums, it's time to make it really shine. This is where you get to design the feel of a song. If you want an RnB inspired song, for example, you'll want piano, some horns, and maybe some jazzy guitar (Ex. Blues Scholars ""The Ave""). If you want an epic, cinematic song you'll be adding strings, tubas, gongs, etc (Ex. Big Boi's ""General Patton"").


Play around with sounds constantly-- the only way to find out what sounds best is to try out as many different orchestrations as possible. , Looping is when you take several bars of music and repeat throughout a song so it sounds like someone is playing the part the entire time. It allows you to create a consistent beat for the MC to rap over and keeps you from tediously writing out the same part over and over again.


The best loops are seamless. That is, it is impossible to tell that the part was essentially copy and pasted together.

, Sampling is when you splice bit of other songs into your song, using the old part to create something entirely new. Sampling is one of the building blocks of hip-hop producing, but you should always do it with caution -- sampling without permission can be illegal.


Use sample sparingly, finding 2-3 notes that you like and distorting them, repeating them, or chopping them up into something new. , Whether you do them yourself or have someone else rapping, record the vocals to your song and tinker with the length, chorus placement, and any intros or outros you want.

, Use your producing skills to mesh the lyrics with the beat. For example, at a moment when the lyrics reference the police, it is common to put a siren sound in the song. When you hear particularly powerful lines or rhythms, considering muting the beat so that listeners can hear the rapper clearly, then jumping back in as a surprise.


Build up the beat-- start the song with just drums and bass, and add an instrument each verse, then break it down in the outro (Ex. Outkast's ""Slump"")
Add subtle accents -- even noises that are hard to hear can give the song depth. , Read your software manual and learn about EQ, effects and quantization, and use them where necessary.



EQ: Also known as equalization, this is where you adjust the volume, frequency, and sounds of the entire song so that all the parts fit smoothly together.

Effects: There are endless effects, all of which adjust or alter the sound of an instrument to make it fit the mood of the song. They can create echos, change tones, subtly adjust notes, and much more. They are never permanent, so test them out on every instrument.

Quantization: The art of taking hand-made notes or beats and electronically lining them up with the beat. Quantization is crucial to make a song sound clean and professional, but overdoing it may make a song seem robotic and bland. , The best hip-hop producers forged their own path, learning from the masters while trying things no one else has. Make a song without drums, sample from a polka tune, or use a live band to make your tracks. Follow your creative instincts and keep your ears open to stand out as a producer. "
"
Share your beats with people.,
Promote yourself.,
Collaborate with other rappers and producers.,
Produce a mixtape.,
Keep making beats.",How to Become a Hip Hop Music Producer3," If you want to become a professional, you have to start sharing your songs with friends, family, and strangers. This can be scary, but just remember that music is meant to be shared, and is more fun with other people.


Start with close friends and family members so you feel comfortable with feedback.
Never let anyone tell you that ""you can't make music."" If this is your dream, keep practicing and trying.
Put your music online for instant feedback and listeners. Youtube, SoundCloud, Reddit, ReverbNation--the opportunities to share your talent are endless!

, Once you've got other people nodding their heads to your music, start promoting yourself. Sites such as rocbattle.com, soundclick.com, givemebeats.net, and cdbaby.com are made to promote young producers.


Become active on social media to tap into the largest market you possibly can.
Attend hip-hop shows and network with local musicians and producers. , Part of the beauty of hip-hop is how collaborative it is. Producers and rappers mix and match regularly, finding new inspiration from other musicians and helping each other gain notoriety.


Ask rappers you know if you can produce a song for them.
Offer your beats online, hip-hop forums from Reddit to DatPiff are full of rappers looking for a beat to rap over. , Mixtapes are free albums posted online that act as resumes for the hip-hop community. Even if you cannot get a rapper to give you vocals, put together a collection of songs that people can download and share.

, Kanye West famously proclaimed that he produced ""five beats a day for three summers,"" but that is what it took to break into the industry. Only those that practice every day, make beats for anyone who asks, and constantly learn new tricks will become successful hip-hop producers. Even if you only want to produce for fun, you'll find the only way to real become a hip-hop producer is to produce some hip-hop.

Review the pentatonic scale and the 12-bar blues to inform your soloing.,
Add the ""blue notes"" into the minor pentatonic to transform it into the blues scale.,
Find the all of the root notes within your blues scale.,
Know where the IV and V chord land on your scale.,
Find the I, IV, and V chords elsewhere on the neck to take your playing to the next level.",How to Choose Notes in the Blues Scale1," A great solo fits into the fabric of the song. Luckily, most blues songs fit directly into a familiar chord progression, the 12-bar blues. Furthermore, the blues scale (a variation on the ""minor pentatonic scale"") is one of the easiest and most versatile forms in guitar, but you need to know it forwards and backwards before beginning a more complex style.









Review the 12-bar blues.
Review the minor pentatonic scale.;
, Within the minor pentatonic scale, not matter where you are on the fretboard, there is one note you can add in two places, known as a ""flat fifth,"" ""blues note,"" or even ""devil's note"" to get a blues scale. They occur one fret after the 3rd note in your scale, and one fret after the 8th note in your scale. Seen, for example, in the A-minor scale, they are the bolded notes:









e|----------------------5-8-------------|
B|------------------5-8-----------------|
G|--------------5-7-8------------------|
D|----------5-7-------------------------|
A|-----5-6-7---------------------------|
E|-5-8----------------------------------|, The root note is the key of the song and the first note of the scale. If you started on the 6th string, 5th fret (an A), you'd be playing the A-minor blues scale, in the key of A. This also means that the song, and backing chords, return often to A, meaning you need to be able to find the A anywhere in the scale to sync back with the backing chords.









e|---------------------5-8-------------|
B|-----------------5-8-----------------|
G|-------------5-7---------------------|
D|---------5-7-------------------------|
A|-----5-7-----------------------------|
E|-5-8---------------------------------|, Remembering back to the 12-bar progression, the blues move in a simple, easy structure that repeats every twelve bars. Good note selection mimics this progression, using licks that originate from the IV chord while the IV chord is being played, for example. In an A-minor blues, the IV chord is a D, and the V chord is an E. The best part is, once you know where the IV and V notes are in the pentatonic, they will be in the same place no matter what key you're playing in. For A-minor, they can be found:









Note: The IV chord is italicized, the V chord is bolded.
e|---------------------5-8-------------|
B|-----------------5-8-----------------|
G|-------------5-7---------------------|
D|---------5-7-------------------------|
A|-----5-7-----------------------------|
E|-5-8---------------------------------|, While this article mostly focuses on the basics of navigating the blues scale, adventurous players should dive off the deep end once they feel comfortable. You know your three ""root"" notes -- so go find them further down the fret board. Look for patterns and expand your playing to the deeper and higher notes for more melodic variety.








"
"
Start your solo around the root note, emphasizing it however possible.,
Base your early licks around the root note of the song.,
Shift your riffs to feature the root of the IV chord when the chord changes.,
Find and use the V chord as you shift into the turnaround.,
Bring your turnaround, the end of the whole, back towards your I chord note.,
Bend, slide, and hammer-on to root notes and chord changes to provided emotive, bluesy emphasis.",How to Choose Notes in the Blues Scale2," There are a lot of ways to emphasize notes, but the easiest way is to just begin the riff with the same note as the root chord. As you first start developing, practice hitting the root note right when the rhythm section changes chords -- as soon as they shift to an A7 chord, for example, you should hit an A note. Get used to this kind of synchronization -- while you should definitely not do this every time, practice it now to learn how and when to find the root notes on the spot.








, You don't have to start a riff with the ""right"" note in order to feature it in the riff. The more you can circle back towards the I chord, here an E, for example, the tighter your scales will sound. The video above provides a few practice riffs for the first few measures of an E-minor blues song.









Other than the root note, the rest of the notes are just your normal blues scale. Simply use the root notes as starting places to explore the rest of the scale.

, The 12-bar blues starts with four bars of the root chord, then two bars of the IV. Once you've memorized the root notes of the IV chord, use them to anchor your soloing during these chords. In an E-minor blues, like the one in the video, the IV chord is an A.








, In an E-minor blues song, the V chord is a D. The V chord is played only for one bar at a time, making it much faster to get to and get out of. A quick riff based around the V chord, however, then sliding it quickly back to the I, is the hallmark of good note selection. Check the video for a couple of good V chord licks.








, As the blues wrap around, you have 4 measures of to ""turn around"" the song and bring it back to the I chord. The progression is V-IV-I-V, or B-A-E-B when playing in E-minor. This is a good place to let loose a bit, showing off some faster playing or some different note choices. If, on each chord change, you can land on the root note, all the better. But the only one you must hit is the I chord at the beginning of the next 12 bars. As the turnaround ends, get ready to return to the root.








, Bends, hammer-ons, pull-offs, slides, and vibrato are all fantastic ways to mix up your tone and draw attention to important notes, giving you room to dazzle during your solo. While it requires some practice and a bit of forethought, you can start on a ""blues"" note like 2md string, 3nd fret of the E-minor scale (shown in video), then bend it up a full-step into the E on the 5th fret.

Make sure you're in a clear, open space with no chance of bumping into people or things.,
Maintain good posture.,
If someone is with you, be wary of them.,
Make sure you're standing correctly.,
Make sure there is someone with you to help turn your sheet music (if there is more than one page).,
Relax!,
Don't panic if your hand is hurting or aching a little.,
If you have long hair, tie it up.,
Make sure your hand is positioned correctly.,
Be slow when bringing your violin up to your chin.,Allow calluses on your fingers to avoid cuts from the strings.",How to Avoid Injury as a Violinist," Do a full stroke of your bow and see where your elbow naturally rests. If your elbow is slightly close to something like a wall, take a step away and reposition yourself accordingly.;
, Having a bad posture won't cause injury but it may be uncomfortable and put a strain on your neck and shoulders. Stand upright, straight-backed, and make sure you hold your violin up; imagine there is a ball balanced on the strings of your violin and you have to make sure it stays there rather than sliding off the edge and falling on the floor. By having good posture, you won't hurt your muscles and will feel a lot more comfortable (it isn't fun having an achy shoulder during a 3-hour concert and not being able to rest).

, This could be a teacher or just someone who is watching you play, but make sure they are standing back to minimize the risk of accidentally hitting them with the bow when you do a retake.

, Stand with your feet slightly apart, flat and firmly on the ground, and never place one foot on top of the other. This could cause you to lose balance and you wouldn't want to topple over and break your violin (or hurt yourself).

, If you are quite new to the violin, then this will be helpful as it's hard to turn a piece of paper when both hands are occupied. You don't want to try to flip a page too quickly and end up knocking over a huge score and hurting yourself.

, Don't be tense; just relax and play the piece as fluidly as you can. This will help you be more aware of the things around you and will automatically improve your posture.

, This is just due to playing and shouldn't bother you too much. If your hand is really hurting, then take a break and try to stop your fingers from growing stiff.

, It's unlikely that this will cause a problem, but if you're leaning forwards while playing, your hair might dangle onto the strings of the violin and could get caught under the bow.

, The main reason you may have an aching hand is the fact that it isn't placed correctly. When playing, make sure your left hand (the hand that's pressing on the strings,) is slightly arched, and that the palm and heel of your hand isn't squashed or pressed against the neck of the violin. Not only will this relieve any pain, but it will help you move into third position more fluidly.

, It may be a minor problem, but try not to make a huge passionate swing when placing your violin on your collarbone, as it usually ends up hitting you in the jaw. This may be more embarrassing than painful, but it's still something to keep in mind.

Select on-ear headphones for a high-quality, natural sound.,
Purchase over-ear headphones to block out all sound.,
Choose in-ear headphones for portability.,
Think twice before buying wireless headphones.,
Read the specs, but know which ones matter.",How to Buy High Quality Headphones1," On-ear headphones are small pads or coverings that rest on top of the ears. Some people find these the most comfortable option, as they do not completely cover or go inside the ears.


Outside noise enters in with on-ear headphones, making them a good option for people who still need to hear what’s going on around them (like joggers).On-ear headphones offer a more “open” sound, which may sound more natural than closed, or over-ear headphones.
On-ear headphones are typically made from lighter (but still durable) materials, for increased portability compared to over-ear headphones.;
, Also known as full size headphones, this option completely surrounds your outer ear and fits snugly on the head. They may not sound as natural as on-ear headphones -- but you also won't have any pesky interferences drifting into your music. Some people find the fit of over-ear headphones to be uncomfortable. Find the measurements of the ear cups to determine whether they'll be good for you or not.
Over-ear headphones are made of sturdy material and are not as portable as other options., Also known as ear buds, in-ear headphones are more portable and less noticeable than other options. Be prepared to pay a higher price for quality sound.Given their size, the average pair of in-ear headphones are unlikely to provide high-quality sound. Beats X and Bose Quiet Control 30 are two exceptions. Because they are inserted directly into the ear, in-ear headphones have natural sound-rejection. That means you can listen at safer volumes, without interference., Headphone technology is advancing rapidly, and wireless headphones operated through bluetooth are gaining popularity.Wireless headphones are convenient for on-the-go use, but they do not (yet) deliver the best sound. , Headphones may advertise a lot of terms you don’t really know what they mean, which can leave you paying extra for a feature you don’t really need.


Manufacturers are often inconsistent with how they measure sensitivity, or how loud the sound sounds at a given volume. In general, anything that is between 80 to 125 dB SPL/mW will deliver high-quality sound.Don't go for anything that has a SNR (signal-to-noise ration) of less than 20:1, otherwise you run the risk of crackly, unclear audio. Headphone impedance isn't something to worry about unless you want a pair for professional audio work, or only plan to use them at home. For on-the-go use and for most consumers, low impedance (50 ohm and below) will deliver rich, quality sound. "

Due to their larger size, noise-canceling headphones are not as portable as in-ear headphones, for example.
Noise-cancelation is not advised for people who need to stay alert to what is happening around them, like drivers or people who exercise outside.

, If you are more likely to use your headphones for entertainment than music, surround-sound headphones deliver the richest sound.


Surround-sound headphones eliminate the detached quality that can come from watching TV or movies with regular headphones (since the sound originates near the ear rather than the television). , If you are looking to make a worthwhile investment in your child’s headphones to protect his or her health, consider choosing a set that won’t go above a certain volume.

Read the reviews.,
Don't be guided by brand.,
Try them on.,
Watch out for knockoffs.,
Keep your receipt.",How to Buy High Quality Headphones3," These days, it’s easier than ever to learn about a product by reading its online reviews. Interested in a particular model? See what current or former users have to say about it by doing your research.


Websites like Amazon.comand Consumer Reportsare typically good places to find reliable consumer reviews.
Don’t let two or three negative reviews affect your choice -- consider the average review, instead. Many review sites use a star rating system, which can be helpful for gauging customer satisfaction.
Look especially for reviews related to your intended use. Are there many people who use the headphones for studying? If that’s what you’re looking for, that’s great news.

, Headphones come in and out of fashion, and some brands that are really well known do not actually provide the best sound quality. As much as possible, try to avoid letting the brand name guide your decision.


The popular Beats by Dre are good for dub and hip hop, but may drown out other genres of music.Optoma, Sennheiser, and Bang and Olufsen may not have the same sticker appeal, but they provide great sound for a variety of musical tastes., A high-quality pair of headphones should be almost unnoticeable after you put them on. If the headphones feel uncomfortable after half a minute, if they fall out of your ears, or if they’re too tight, it might be an idea to look at another pair. While you’re trying the headphones on, play something to see what you think of the sound quality. Listening to several genres can give you a good idea of what they’ll sound like for a variety of tunes.
Check to make sure the cord seems sturdy enough to withstand daily use, and that is unlikely to fray.
Even if you’re buying your headphones online, you can go into Best Buy or your local electronics store to try them on first. It’s a small investment in time that can help you make the best decision.

, If you're buying headphones over the Internet, remember that if the deal seems too good to be true, it likely is. The headphone industry is especially full of knockoffs -- so know that you’re probably not going to get that top-of-the-line brand for $2.99. Buy only from authorized dealers and resellers.
Check the product’s serial number with the manufacturer to determine whether it’s real or not. Trust your intuition. If you see a lot of typos on the box, if the product seems different from what you expected, or if the color doesn’t match the description, you probably have a fake., Most electronics purchased from a reputable retailer are returnable within a certain amount of time. Hold onto your receipt just in case your headphones end up not working out!

If possible, purchase specialized drum amplification equipment that is made by the same manufacturer. The amplification equipment will be optimized for your drum set. However, many people also use equipment from several different manufacturers with success.


Check the specification requirements of the sound equipment to make sure your drum kit is compatible.
Bass and guitar equipment may work, but drum amplification equipment is best. Specialized amps and speakers will be able to amplify low drum tones better than other equipment.;
, Passive speakers are speakers that require an amplifier to create sound. Amplifiers are small boxes with sound settings that feed the sound signal to the speakers.If you’re going to use your drum kit professionally, it may be best to purchase a passive speaker and amplifier combination so you have better control over the sound.


Check the specifications of your amplifier and speaker before buying them to make sure they’re compatible with one another.If possible, buy your amplifier and speaker from the same manufacturer. This will eliminate incompatibility problems.

, Powered speakers are great options for amateur musicians because the amplifier is built-in.There will there be less equipment to set up and carry and fewer cords to keep track of. Furthermore, you won’t have to worry about tweaking the amplifier settings to create a good sound.


These speakers are sometimes called “active” speakers. However, this term actually refers to the inner wiring and does not mean the same thing.

, Set up your equipment on stage or in your practice space before plugging anything in. Move your speakers to the left and right of the stage to avoid sound interference with any microphones.Don’t plug anything into a power source until all of the equipment is connected via cables.

, Locate the drum module. This is the “brain” of the drum kit that allows you to alter the sounds, change the settings, and turn the kit on and off. Look around the module for the word “output.” This is where you’ll connect the drum kit to the speaker.


Sometimes the output jack says “output/headphones.”Most output jacks take ¼ inch cables. However, if your output jack takes a different size, purchase a converter that will allow you to use ¼ inch cables.

, Use long, ¼ inch cables. First, plug one end of the cable into the output jack of your drum set and the other end into the input jack of your amplifier. Next, use another cable to connect the amplifier’s output and the speaker’s input.


If you’re using an active speaker, use a ¼ inch cable to connect the drum module’s output jack and the speaker’s input jack.
Make sure you have plenty of slack on the cable. If the cable is taut, you or another bandmate could trip over it and damage your equipment.

, Turn all of the volumes to zero. Next, plug the system components into a power source and turn everything on.Slowly raise the sound as you test your drums to find the perfect sound level.


The sound can be adjusted from the drum module, the speakers, or the amplifier.

, Most drum modules allow you to control the different tones that your drum set creates. You can alter the volume of the low and high notes or change the timbre of the notes by “changing” drum sets. Cycle through the different drum types to imitate a variety of popular higher-end acoustic drums.


If you purchased an inexpensive drum kit, these features may not be available.
If you still don’t like the sound of your drum set, consider upgrading the module. Purchase a higher-quality version from the same brand to replace your old module.

, Most bands have a mixing board to help them adjust the quality of their music. However, some traditional mixing boards can’t handle the low bass tones of an electric drum set. If you notice that your lower drumming notes sound dull, or if your band’s mixer runs out of input space, consider using your own specialized sound mixer.


If you don’t use a lot of cymbal sounds when you play, a line-level mixer will work well. Otherwise, choose a quality mike-and-line mixer. These mixers can be bought at specialty music stores, online, or at secondhand music shops.

, If you notice that your lower drumming notes are flat and lifeless, try adjusting the bass and treble knobs on your amplifier. Turn them up to amplify the lower notes and turn them down to make the lower notes quieter.This feature is not available on every amplifier. If you don’t see any sound knobs on the front of your amplifier, you probably can’t adjust the bass or treble tones.

Keep practicing until you get up to ""concert speed"" (the speed written above the notes, or the speed that you want to be able to play it).",How to Approach Reading Piano Notes to Get the Right Sound1," So get started by listening to the song or practice playing the following to achieve the tempo and rhythm:

"
"
Learn the tune before you attempt to read and play the song.,
Prepare by scanning and visualising the notes first to find parts you might get in trouble with reading while playing.,
Make sure to stay in tempo!,
Try these steps to reading notes.,
Remember, these skill won't come by themselves.,
Study up, ask and read about different methods of scoring music to know whether it's for vocal or instrumental, duet, trio, 4 part harmony, or ""easy piano"", or is sheet music with a lead-sheet with a melody line and numbered chords for a studio musician, or geared for a jazz ensemble.",How to Approach Reading Piano Notes to Get the Right Sound2," It's better to listen to a piano version, but other instruments will also help. Your mind will pick up the melody and rhythm, and then knowing the tune makes it easier to know whether you are producing the intended sound for what you read.;
, It is very important to realise whether you can't -- by either technical skill or physical technique -- play the song; so, you don't start and have to quit because of things you don't know.

, It is very annoying to practice the song with a metronome, and one might not help. But, maybe it is syncopated (a kind of off-beat rhythm), varied from a standard rhythmic accent:Throw a pair of tennis shoes or jeans in the clothes dryer. Chances are the rhythm you hear will be syncopated, like an ad-lib, varied from standard, but in a general pattern, such as jazz.

, This follows the level of how good you are at reading notes.


Read and play only one hand at a time.

Practice the treble and the base clef separately.


Read and put both hands together when you can.
Read both hands and characterise the tune of the song properly working up to the desired speed.

, Learning to read notes takes many hours practice, but saves you from fumbling later. As a student you can read loads of notes, not only music supplied by the teacher, but also found other places by yourself.

,"
"
Try to calculate the beats per minute and use a metronome to set that pace, but you do not really need one.,
Alternatively, try playing extra slowly.,
Make sure that you play the notes right!",How to Approach Reading Piano Notes to Get the Right Sound3," Make sure that you understand the timing and play the proper note lengths.

, Imagine a snails pace. The slower, the more time you have to read, find the notes and finger them for the sound as desired.

, Practicing them wrongly will make you build a habit of using the wrong notes as if they're the right ones! The same goes for fingering the melody and chords correctly.


If you have a teacher, let him or her play it for you.
Clapping the notes is also a good way to get a feel for the time and rhythm of the song!

, Go for days without any other music. You will notice the difference.

,, It can be explained many different ways, but the best way to learn it is just to listen to jazz. However, be wary; artists such as Monk and Mingus have distinctive styles of swing that may not sound good on all charts.

, Start with a simple 4 measure beat, swinging track by Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers (check the syncopation on ""Moanin'""). Move on to tracks and both.

, Listen to the interaction of great tightly interacting jazz groups, like the ones of Bill Evans or Dave Holland, in live contexts. Notice how they ""feel"" each other in the group, how they react to one another. The musical experience will be more and more rewarding and gain depth as you do so.

Obtain a fingering chart.,
Read the key.,
Look at the chart.,
Interpret the information.,
Warm up and start playing your instrument.",How to Read a Fingering Chart," You may be able to get one from your band director, or you can find one in most method books. However, keep in mind that some very, very beginning books may not have a complete chart, as they'd leave out notes that you probably wouldn't be learning that early on (mainly altissimo notes). If you don't mind this, go right ahead and find any chart that will do. Otherwise, you'll need to be more selective. You can also find charts on the internet (see below).;
, Most charts come with a diagram of the instrument showing the symbols that correspond with each hole or key, sometimes as part of the chart, and sometimes as a separate page. Especially if you're not very familiar with the system of the instrument, this is a very important thing to do. Otherwise, you'll take one look at the fingering chart and be instantly confused.

, While fingering charts can come in many formats, the most common, especially in less advanced method books, consists of little boxes for each note, containing either diagrams of the instrument or little circles and funny shapes used to represent the keys with some areas darkened out or colored.

, There are several things that you'll need to keep in mind when actually reading the chart.


Unless otherwise indicated, the dark or colored symbols indicate a pressed key or covered hole. On some instruments that require half-hole fingerings (where only half the hole is covered), this will be indicated by a half-filled circle instead of a completely colored one.
When more than one fingering is listed, the first is usually the most common. The others are alternate fingerings, which may be useful for trills or correcting pitch. Some charts will actually indicate this with a symbol or footnote under certain fingerings. For instance, if a note is known to be somewhat flat or sharp on most instruments, there may be an alternate fingering that can correct this.
Some more detailed fingering charts will give other advice to sharpen or flatten a note slightly. Be sure to read the small print. They may also offer tips for sustaining tone when playing softer, such as covering half holes.
If you're unsure where certain registers end and others begin, some charts will shade in or somehow separate the altissimo or lower registers from the ""normal"" range. This is also an indication of what notes might be ""harder"" than others.

, Keep a fingering chart handy... you never know when you'll need it!

Use the major or minor scale in whatever key your prefer to find potential chords for your progression.,
Use Roman numerals to number the chords in your major scale, allowing you to make easy progressions.,
Kick off your song with the root, or chord that matches you key.,
Learn common chord progressions to get used to the flow of songs.,
Change the type of chord (minor, blues, minor seventh chords, etc.),
Use the minor scale to create progressions, instead of the major.",How to Create Chord Progression for a Song," The C-Major scale, for example, contains the following notes in the following order: C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C. This means that the following chords can all be a part of a song in C-major, so you can (and should) use them to create a chord progression in the key of C.






;
, In this fashion, a pattern in any key can be represented “generically.” For example -- a common chord progression is I-IV-V. This just means that, no matter your key, you hit the 1st note/chord in the major scale, then the 4th, then the 5th.



For example: In C-major, the I is a C, the IV is an F, and the V is a G.

, The I chord is called the root or tonic chord. It forms the base to which the other chords in a progression relate. Many books and other websites go into great detail about music theory, and there are many terms that you should ultimately learn and understand, but basic chord progressions always start with this ""tonic.""

, The first, the fourth, and the fifth (I – IV – V) are chords that sound good together in a progression for most genres of music. So, for the example in the Key of E-major, your thumb (I) would be E, your ring finger (IV) would be A, and your pinky (V) would be B. In time, you will learn these “chord sets”, but for now you should feel free to experiment. Other common progressions include:









I-V-vi-IV -- here, the sixth chord (vi) is played as a minor chord. This is why it is lowercase. It is sometimes switched up (in the chorus, or bridge) to vi–IV–I–V.
vi-V-IV-V -- Great over many genres.
The 12-bar blues.
ii-V-I -- here, the IV chord is replaced by its submediant, ii. The ii chord is a very commonly used replacement for IV. ii-V-I also makes the foundation for descending fifths.(iii-vi-ii-V-I)

, to change the feel of the song without changing chord progression. When playing the blues, the V chord is often played as a 7th. Sadder songs often use minor chords. You can adjust the type of chord while still following the root notes in your chord changes to make a great song in any genre, while still keeping the progression simple.











So, to play the blues in C using the 3-chord theory, strum C for four bars, F for two bars, a couple more C, then a bar of G7th, a bar of F, and back to C again…
C///, C///, C///, C///, F///, F///, C///, C///, G7th///, F///, C///…














, Once you have chord progressions down with the major scale, how do they sound with a different one? Note, however, that the classic I-IV-V chord progression is the exact same in major and minor keys..









The C-minor scale is: C-D-E♭-F-G-A♭-B♭-C. The I-IV-V chord progression is then C-F-G, just like before. But what happens with an I-V-vi-V progression? How do the progressions sound different with just one changed chord?

Know what your audience expects.",How to Make Electronic Music," While “synthesizer” is used synonymously with “electronic musical instrument,” the synthesizer is the part of the electronic instrument that produces the actual music: the beats, the rhythms, and the tones.


Early synthesizers, such as the Moog Minimoog, were capable of producing only one tone at a time (monophonic). These synthesizers could not produce the secondary tones that other musical instruments could, although some synthesizers could produce two pitches at once if two keys were pressed. From the mid-1970s on, synthesizers that can produce multiple tones at once (polyphonic) have been available, allowing you to produce chords as well as individual notes.Most early synthesizers were separate from the means used to control the sounds they made. Many electronic musical instruments, particularly those for casual home use, now feature the synthesizer physically integrated with its control unit.;
, The earliest synthesizers were controlled by flipping switches, turning knobs, or in the case of the Theremin (what the Etherophone was renamed), by where the operator’s hands were positioned over the instrument. Modern controllers come in more musician-friendly varieties and control the synthesizer through the Musical Instrumental Digital Interface (MIDI) standard. Some of the controllers are described below:


Keyboard. This is the most common synthesizer controller. Keyboards range in size from the full 88-key (7-octave) keyboard found on digital pianos to as few as 25 keys (2 octaves) on a toy-sized keyboard. Keyboards for home use typically have 49, 61, or 76 keys (4, 5, or 6 octaves). Some keyboards feature weighted keys to simulate the responsiveness of a piano, while others feature spring-loaded keys, and still others combine springs with lighter weights than fully weighted keys.. Many feature touch sensitivity, where the hardness of the keys (how hard they are struck) determines how loud the sound generated is.
Mouthpiece/wind controller. This controller is found on a wind synthesizer, an electronic instrument designed similar to a soprano saxophone, clarinet, recorder, or trumpet. You blow into it to regulate the sound, which can be modified by using your thumb or jaw in certain ways.MIDI guitar. This is software that lets you use your acoustic or electric guitar, with a pickup, to control a synthesizer.MIDI guitars work by attempting to convert string vibrations into digital data. There is often a delay between the input and output because of the amount of sampling necessary to create the digitized sound.SynthAxe: No longer made, the SynthAxe worked by dividing the fretboard into 6 diagonal zones and used the strings as sensors. How much bending the strings were subjected to determined the tone generated.Keytar: This controller is shaped like the body and neck of a guitar, but has a 3-octave keyboard on the guitar body and other sound-manipulating controls on the neck. Inspired by an 18th-century instrument called the orphica, it offers players the control of a keyboard and the mobility of a guitar.Electronic drum pads: Introduced in 1971, electronic drum pads are usually available in kits similar to that of acoustic drums, including cymbals. Early versions played pre-recorded samples, while later versions create the sounds mathematically. Used with headphones, it is possible to play an electronic drum kit so that only the player hears the sound it makes.Radio drum. Originally intended for use as a three-dimensional “mouse,” the radio drum senses the position of its two sticks in three dimensions, varying the sound produced according to where on the “drum” surface it is touching.BodySynth. This was a wearable controller that used muscle tension and body movement to control sound and lighting. It was intended for use by dancers and performance artists, but in many cases was too difficult to control. Simpler forms of the BodySynth have used gloves or shoes to serve as control units., While standalone electronic musical instruments are enough to play electronic music, you will need a computer system if you want to produce electronic music.


A desktop or laptop works well for creating music. If you plan on producing music at a fixed location, you’ll probably want a desktop. If you want to produce music at different locations, such as wherever your band rehearses, you’ll probably want a laptop.
Use the operating system you’re most comfortable with. However, you should use the most recent version of Windows or MacOS that you can get access to.
Your system should have a powerful enough CPU and enough memory to easily handle creating music with it. If you don’t know what to look for, a custom-built system designed for audio or video game usage should give you an idea of what kind of specifications to look for., You can make perfectly good electronic music with the sound chip that came with your computer and inexpensive speakers. However, if you can afford it, you should consider one or more of the following upgrades:


Sound card. Using a sound card designed for making electronic music is recommended if you plan to do a lot of external recording.Studio monitors. These are not computer monitors, but rather loudspeakers designed for studio recording. (“Monitor” in this sense means that the speaker accurately reproduces the source audio with no or minimal distortion.) Lower-cost quality studio monitors include those made by M-Audio and KRK Systems, while higher-end monitors include those made by Focal, Genelec, and Mackie.Studio-grade headphones. Listening through headphones instead of speakers lets you concentrate on individual parts of your song better, helping you track rhythms and sound levels. Studio headphone manufacturers include Beyerdynamic and Sennheiser., You’ll need the following software applications for making electronic music:


Digital audio workstation (DAW). The DAW is the actual music-making software that enables all your other software components work together to make music. Their interface usually simulates the mixer, track, and transport controls of analog music studios, as well as a waveform display of the recorded sound.Various DAWs include Ableton Live, Cakewalk Sonar, Cubase, FL Studio, Logic Pro (operates in MacOS only), Pro Tools, Reaper, and Reason. There are also freeware DAWs such as Ardour and Zynewave Podium.Audio editor program. An audio editor program provides greater musical editing capability than that found in DAW software, including the ability to edit samples and to convert your composition to MP3 format. Sound Forge Audio Studio is an example of an inexpensive audio editor, while Audacity is one of many freeware versions available.
Virtual Studio Technology (VST) synthesizers/instruments. These are software versions of the synthesizer components of the electronic musical instruments described in the previous section. You install them as plugins into your DAW. Many of these plugins can be found online for free by doing a search for “free soft synths” (free software synthesizers) or “free vsti,” or you can purchase VST synthesizers from providers such as Artvera, H.G. Fortune, IK Multimedia, Native Instruments, or reFX.
VST effects. These plugins provide musical effects such as reverberation, choral sound, delay, and others. They are available from many of the same providers as VST synthesizer plugins, in either paid or freeware versions.
Samples. Samples are snatches of musical sounds, beats, and rhythms you can use to enhance your compositions. They are usually organized in packs specific to a given musical genre (such as blues, jazz, country, rap, or rock) and include both individual sounds and sound loops. Commercial sample packs usually offer their samples royalty-free; you buy the license to use them in your own compositions when you buy the sample pack. Some audio software companies include access to free samples online, and there are third-party sources of both free samples and samples you have to pay for., Although you can compose music on your computer with its keyboard as a “virtual piano keyboard” and your mouse, you’ll likely find it more natural to connect a MIDI controller to your system. As with standalone electronic musical instruments, a keyboard is the most commonly used MIDI controller, but you can use any of the other types of controllers described under “Electronic Musical Instrument Components” that your software supports.

, While you can play an electronic musical instrument or compose music on computer without being able to read music, some knowledge of musical structure will help you understand how to make better arrangements and spot mistakes in the composition you’re working on.


Some of the music theory that can help you is covered in the wikiHow article “How to Make Music.”

, Even if you’ve tried it before you bought it, spend some time experimenting with your equipment before you take on a serious project. You’ll have a better idea of what it can do and perhaps come up with a few ideas for projects to do with it.

, Each musical genre has certain elements it is associated with. The easiest way to learn those elements is to listen to a number of songs in each genre you’re interested in to see how they make use of these elements:


Beats and rhythms. Rap and hip-hop are noted for heavy, driving beats and rhythms, while big band jazz is noted for bouncy, syncopated rhythms and country music often features a shuffle beat.
Instrumentation. Jazz is noted for its use of brass (trumpet, trombone) and woodwind instruments (clarinet, saxophone), while heavy metal is noted for loud electric guitars, Hawaiian music for steel guitars, folk music for acoustic guitars, mariachi for trumpets and guitars, and polka for tuba and accordion. However, many songs and artists in one genre have successfully incorporated instrument sounds from another genre, such as Bob Dylan’s adopting the electric guitar for folk music at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival,the use of mariachi trumpets to open Johnny Cash’s “Ring of Fire,”or Ian Anderson’s flute-playing as lead musician for the rock group Jethro Tull.Song structure: Many songs with vocals played on the radio begin with an introduction, followed by a verse, then a chorus, another verse, repeat the chorus, a bridge (often an abbreviated verse), the chorus, and a closing (called an “outro”). In contrast, most of the instrumental “trance” music played in dance clubs begins with an introduction, followed by a melody hook that builds to a point where all the elements of the song are played together, concluding with a fading outro., The beats and rhythms are the backbone that the rest your song hangs on. Here is where you use the drum sounds from your sample packs.

, The next thing to add is the bass rhythm, whether from a bass guitar or other low-pitched instrumental sound. Be sure that your bass rhythm and drum beat work together before bringing in other instrumental sounds., Not all songs have a single rhythm. Some use multiple rhythms, with the additional rhythms coming into the song at places designed to catch the listener’s attention or at key moments in the song’s story. Be sure the additional rhythms work with the main rhythm to produce the effect you’re looking for.

, This is where your VST instruments come into play. You can use their preset sounds or experiment with their controls to find the sound you want., You want the sounds produced by the instruments that play the beat, rhythms, and melody to work together. To achieve this, pick one component to serve as the reference sound to adjust the other components against; in most cases, this will be the beat sound.In some cases, you’ll be looking for a “fatter” (richer) sound instead of a louder sound. To do this, you can use multiple instruments on a given part or use the same instrument multiple times. The latter is often done with vocal recordings, either of background singers or sometimes the lead singer.This is how singer Enya achieves her sound on her records.
You may want to introduce some variety by using different instruments on different choruses of the song, particularly if you’re trying to evoke different emotional responses from your listeners at different places. You may also want to vary the register, the pitch at which the song is being played, to keep the song lively.
You don’t have to fill every second of your composition with every trick at your disposal. Sometimes, such as on the verses, you can leave out the chordal harmonies and let the beat, melody, and vocals carry your song. At other times, such as at the beginning and end, you may want to use only vocals., If you’re making electronic music for someone other than yourself, you have to take your audience’s expectations into account, such as in creating an intro that will grab them and make them listen to the rest of the song. You don’t have to cater to their every whim, however; if making a big production of the chorus doesn’t seem right to you, don’t do it."

, Clap your hands together directly above the cup two times. Your hands should be about six inches above the cup.If your hands are too far from the cup, it will be more difficult to increase your speed.

, Alternate your hands during this step. Start with your right hand, then left hand, the right hand. You will use primarily your fingertips to tap the cup.Alternatively, you could tap the table on either side of the cup three times. You would still alternate right hand, left hand, right hand.

, Clap above the cup again. Make sure you are still about six inches above the cup. However, this time, just clap once., Grasp the bottom of the cup with your right hand. Pick the cup up to hover about two to three inches above the table. Try to make an audible sound when grasping the cup., Move the cup about three inches to the right. Set the cup down, making another audible noise. The cup should still be rim down., Clap once again above the cup. Continue to keep your hands about six inches above the cup., Turn your right hand so that your thumb is pointing down and your palm is facing the right. Grasp the cup with your hand., Naturally rotate the cup ninety degrees clockwise. The rim, or opening, of the cup should be facing the left., Use the palm of your hand to hit the opening of the cup. Be sure that your hand connects with the rim to make another audible noise., Turn the cup a little further in a fluid motion. The cup just almost be straight up and down with the rim up., Before the cup reaches the straight up and down position, tap the bottom edge of the cup to the table., Continue to turn the cup clockwise. Grasp the bottom of the cup with your left hand. Try to make another audible noise when your left hand touches the cup. These noises maintain the beat of the Cup Song., Cross your right arm to hit the table near the left side of your body., Cross your left arm over you right and firmly place the cup back down on the table. The cup should land back down on its rim near the right side of your body., Continue to practice the Cup Song until you get faster. Once you feel comfortable with the movements, try putting it to the song “When I’m Gone.” The movements repeat throughout the song."

Give your full attention to the music in front of you.,
Divide music into large chunks.,
Look for familiar rhythms.,

Use drills to improve.,
Read through the music.,
Play through the piece in your head.,
Breathe, and brush off mistakes.",How to Sight Read Music," When sight reading music, you will see whole notes, half notes, quarter notes, eighth notes, and sixteenth notes. These notes are characterized by differing duration, or the length of time it's played. The whole note is the longest, and they get shorter respectively. For example, a sixteenth note is 1/16 of a whole note.While you might think music and math have nothing in common, understanding the different types of music notes is as simple as understanding basic fractions. For example, a quarter note is 1/4 of a whole note. In other words, you can play four quarter notes in the time you would play one whole note.
Each note has a different symbol. The parts of the symbols are the head, the round part of the note, the stem, the line that extends from the head, and the flag, the curved line coming off the stem, like a flag.
A whole note is denoted by just an open note head, without any stem or flag. A half note has an open note head and a stem. A quarter note has a closed (filled in) head and a stem. An eighth note has a closed head, a stem, and one flag. A sixteenth note has a closed head, a stem, and two flags.;
, Time signatures appear on all pieces of sheet music, and they tell you the amount and type of notes in each measure. To put it simply, time signatures tell you how fast or slow the song will be played. When it comes to sight reading, this is the very first thing you will note about a piece, so it's extremely important that you understand time signatures thoroughly. Practice different rhythm exercises to make yourself feel more comfortable working within different time signatures.If the time signature is 4/4, that means that each measure contains four quarter notes. The top number refers to the amount of notes, and the bottom refers to the type of note.
A time signature of 3/4 means there are three quarter notes, 6/8 means six eighth notes, 3/2 means three half notes, and so on.
Use a metronome to help keep track of tempo., The key signature is a grouping of signatures that instructs you to play a certain note a half-step higher or lower than you typically would. Basically, the key signature tells you how to play the music however the composer intended, and therefore it's a crucial component of sight reading.The key signature can be found right next to the staff, generally at the beginning of a line of musical notation.To read sharp (major) key signatures, look at the last sharp on the key signature and move a half-step above that. So if the last sharp is a C, the key would be in D major.
To read flat (minor) key signatures, look at the second to last flat (read the flats left to right). If the second to last flat is E, the song is in E-flat major.
F major (or D minor) is the exception to this rule as this particular key signature only has one flat (B-flat).

, There are two types of clefs: treble and bass, and notes look different depending on which clef you’re using. Learn the location of every note on both sets of clefs and practice until you recognize the notes just by looking at them.On a treble clef, the line notes spell out EGBDF from top to bottom. Use the mnemonic device, “Every Good Boy Deserves Fudge.”
On a treble clef, the space notes spell out FACE from top to bottom.
On a bass clef, the line notes spell out GBDFA from top to bottom. Use the mnemonic device, “Good Birds Don’t Fly Away.”
On a bass clef, the space notes spell out ACEG from top to bottom. Use the mnemonic device, “All Cows Eat Grass.”, Practicing scales will help both vocalists and instrumentalists become more familiar with the names of each note and where each note falls on the staff. If you’re an instrumentalist, practice the scales without looking at your hands.If you’re looking at your hands, you’re not able to let your eyes focus on reading the music.
Instrumentalists should also practice sight singing. This will help you work on phrasing, intonation and musicality.

, In other words, act as if every piece of music you are sight reading is the most important thing in the world at that moment, clearing your mind of other daily distractions and worries. Sight reading involves a lot of moving parts – you have to keep track of notes, rhythms, key changes and one thousand other variables. It’s impossible to sight read perfectly without focusing your entire brain on the task at hand.Challenge yourself to sight read an entire piece of music without making any mistakes.
Whenever your mind begins to wander, refocus and start the piece again.

, When you first begin sight-reading, you may attempt to count every beat, divide every rhythm, and tap maniacally to the beat. Relax! Every piece of music has hundreds of notes and trying to count and identify every single one can be exhausting and impossible. Instead, divide the piece into bigger chunks of music and try to read it that way.Cut each measure into two parts, and note where the downbeats are. This is a method of interpreting the music in a more relaxed, musical way.
Now you can look at two beats, or even an entire measure, at a time. This is a lot less chaotic than attempting to count each and every beat.

, While each piece of music you encounter is beautifully unique, there are certainly repeating patterns that you'll continuously encounter. Purchase sight reading practice materials. Children get better at reading words by reading multiple books. Musicians get better at reading music by sight reading multiple pieces. Try going online to sites like Piano Marvel to gain access to sight reading exercises and music pieces you can practice reading.Also look online for free sheet music websites.
Ask your music teacher if they have extra music they’d be willing to let you copy.

, Practice often. The best sight readers are musicians who are relaxed and confident in their skills. Becoming an experienced sight reader can take years, but implementing good practice habits is something you can do right now. Try to practice your sight reading for at least fifteen minutes every day.Write down what you practiced and how long you practiced in your journal.
Practice sight reading slowly. You can always pick up the pace after you feel more comfortable with the music.

, Not only will practice drills help you recognize certain patterns, memorize note types, key signatures, and time signatures, it will also help you become a more confident musician. Websites like TheSightReadingProject.com allows you to practice for free online.Grab a cheap music book, flip to a random page, and start sight-reading something. Just like with any skill, the more you sight read, the more confident and proficient you will become. As you feel more comfortable with the basics, you can start fine-tuning your skills.

, When you first see the piece, take a moment to look it over without your instrument. Try tapping out the rhythm, reading the notes and looking over the structure to see which bars will be repeated.Every time you encounter a new piece of music, you should go through a basic checklist in your head.


Memorize the key signature, divide the music into chunks like previously discussed, note any repeating rhythms and tricky spots, and tune out the day's distractions.
Look for any markings that denote changes in speed, volume or accidentals.
If you have permission, mark these changes on your sheet music using a pencil.

, Take a moment to sound the piece out and look for patterns within the music. See if there are places where the melodies repeat themselves. Study the piece as hard as you can before ever picking up your instrument.Look for places in the music where there are scales or arpeggios.
The more familiar you are with the music, the easier it will be to sight read when you actually have your instrument in hand.

, Sight reading can be overwhelming, but breathing can help you remain focused and can even keep you on tempo. Relax your body and your mind and try to concentrate on the work. Keep going if you make a mistake, because freezing up can only make the problem worse. Make a mental note to practice the part that caused you an issue, and then forget about it.There is more music to play, and you'd be surprised how often an audience misses a small mistake.


If you are a singer or if you play a wind instrument, use a pencil to mark where you should take a breath.
Don’t beat yourself up if you don't read the music perfectly your first time out. Sight reading is a skill that takes time to develop.

Securely attach the PWC lanyard to your life jacket which has to be approved by the Coast Guard;
,
Insist that all operators and passengers wear Coast Guard-approved life jackets at all times.

,
Insist that all operators know and observe the navigation rules of the state.

,
Observe the age-limit rules for all operators to be at least 16 years old.

,
Make sure that there is nothing in the water that could clog the water intake grate and that the PWC is started or ran in water AT LEAST 3 feet (0.9 m) deep.,
Like any other boat, look around before starting and slowly leave the dock.

,
Observe and pay attention to your PWC's fuel level.

,
Idle in residential coves and slow-no-wake zones and do not exceed 5 mph (8.0 km/h).

Be polite to other boaters: everyone has the right to be on the water together.",How to Ride a Personal Watercraft (PWC),",,,, PWC engines can suck rocks and debris from the bottom in shallow waters resulting in a damaged or clogged impeller. Never operate a PWC in shallow water.

,,,,,, All boats which are underway and up on-plane are required to be AT LEAST 100 feet (30.5 m) from other boats and AT LEAST 150 feet (45.7 m) from shore or docks. The same rules apply to PWCs.

, Boats generally travel in a consistent linear pattern whereas PWC operators often ride in impulsive, erratic ""freestyle"" patterns of S curves, circles and figure eights, which substantially increase the potential for collision with a boat and may run afoul of the ""rules of the road"".


Spatial disorientation and inattention can quickly result by being lost in the moment but increase the risk of being hit by another boat after having quickly but unwittingly maneuvered the PWC directly into the path of another boat's immediate strike zone. Freestyle riding that includes radical maneuvers, high-speed spins, carves, jumps and tricks should be performed in a non-residential cove or remote area of the lake that is not subject to frequent boat traffic.

,,,,,, Many other people came to the same place for peace and quiet. If it appears that PWC usage is infringing upon the rights of others to have solace, then ride to areas away from other people where no one will be disrupted. Being a public nuisance puts the entire sport at risk for everyone to face PWC bans and heighten restrictions.

Learn how to operate the Segway before attempting to use it alone.,
Wear appropriate clothing.,
Keep a firm hold on the Segway at all times.,
Avoid abrupt maneuvers when riding a Segway.Although the Segway is able to sense your movement and aims to re-balance you, this mechanism may not be able to rectify your balance if you move too abruptly forward or backward.,
Avoid speeding.,
Keep to solid, even ground.,
Maintain a safe distance between you and the handlebar.,
Avoid pedestrians.,
Watch out for obstacles.,
Think ahead.,
Stop your Segway before getting off it.",How to Ride a Segway Safely," Read the user manual thoroughly. It is strongly advised that you seek instruction from someone who is qualified and experienced in operating Segways.


Practice with people who know Segways before heading off on your own. At the very least, have a spotter when you first climb on and practice.
See How to operate a Segway for more details.;
, At a minimum, wear a safety helmet. Other protective gear to consider wearing includes:


Knee and elbow padding, wrist guards.

Eye protection.
If you're using the Segway at night (presuming it is legal to do so wherever you live), where a high visibility jacket so that people can see you easily. If riding at night, always add lights so that you can see and be seen.

, Always have both feet firmly aboard, and both hands holding the handlebar. Don't try carrying anything in one hand and maneuvering with only one hand. Use a backpack or a cargo holder if you need to carry stuff.

,


Don't turn a segway too fast. Fast turns can cause you to lose control; always lean into a turn and take it slowly.
Don't stop or start a Segway too fast.
Don't ride backward. This ability is meant only for maneuvering out of a tight spot or turning around, not for travel.

, The Segway will warn you if you're going too fast, using a ""Speed Limiter""; it pushes the handlebar back as a way of slowing you down. Heed this and stop leaning forward.


Heed the Stick Shake Warning. This warning is set off when you ride too fast backward or you push the Segway beyond its limits, such as going over rough terrain, down a slope, or speeding up or slowing down too rapidly.Slow down. If it doesn't stop after slowing down, stop and get off as it could be telling you that your battery packs are low or that there are maintenance issues with the Segway.
Indoors, keep to a slow walking pace, stay in the center of corridors as much as possible, give way to every person, and don't take the Segway where it's not permitted.
Outdoors, aim to keep to a fast walking pace, again giving way to pedestrians and being very careful when going around corners.

, Segways are not designed for all-terrain moves. Stick with the paved surfaces they're meant for.


Any abrupt terrain change can cause problems for your safety, such as riding from grass to pavement, speed bump, etc.Do this slowly and with care.
Step off a Segway and use the power assist mode any time you are unsure of how to handle the terrain or area that you're crossing.
Don't ride on roads. Not only is the Segway not made to be a road vehicle, but it's dangerous and may also be illegal. Cross roads with care, use power assist to walk it across if safer.

, Leaning on the handlebar can reduce your ability to control the Segway properly.

, You are moving faster than pedestrians and some pedestrians won't even hear your approach. Always be on the alert for avoiding them, and be ready to call out if anything goes wrong before you can brake.


Generally, keep to the right of the sidewalk in countries with right side drive and keep to the left of the footpath in countries with left side drive, unless your pedestrian traffic norms are different. Heed all local rules about use of sidewalks.

, If there are things in the way of your Segway, they have the potential to knock you off or create a collision. It's up to you to see them, which can be difficult if you're distracted by sightseeing or chatting. Common objects that cause problems include park benches, light poles, signposts, and trees.Avoid holes, curbs, and steps when using the Segway. A Segway can easily trip up on such obstacles.
Don't take your Segway down a steep slope. Doing so will cause it to unbalance, and it's very likely that you'll be thrown out.
Don't ride a Segway on any surface that is slippery, such as ice (including black ice, be aware!), snow, wet grass, oily or greasy areas, or wet floors.
Don't ride over loose items such as branches, pebbles, rocks, broken glass, etc. These can cause the Segway to lose traction and tip you out.

, As with riding a bike, scooter, or any other wheeled transportation that interacts with traffic and pedestrians, stay alert all of the time and react ahead of things happening.


Slow down (and stop if needed) at crossings, intersections, groups of people, driveways, around corners, doorways or other low-hanging areas, etc.
Get out of the way of cars, cyclists, and other traffic. Realize that often you can't be seen or heard, or people may not equate a Segway with being something they need to stop for.
Avoid iPod oblivion or cell phone distractions. Don't use MP3 players or cell phones while operating the Segway.
Don't drink and ride.

, Don't let go of a Segway that is still in balance mode or it will continue to travel away from you and could potentially collide with someone or something.

Recognize and review the basics of the blues.,
Experiment on the pentatonic blues scale to start adding lead licks.,
Play your licks to fill in spaces left by the singer or other instruments, not on top of them.,
Follow the chord changes when beginning riffs, matching your first note to the chord.",How to Add Licks to a Blues Riff1," Playing guitar licks is not necessarily the first skill you need to pick up when playing the blues. Before launching into the nitty-gritty of improvising your own licks, you should consider reviewing:









Twelve Bar Blues
Blues Guitar Phrasing & Scales
Choosing Notes in the Pentatonic Blues Scale;
, At the end of the day, anything played in the right key in the pentatonic blues scale, will sound good over a basic blues track. If you're first starting out, simply play a blues track and start fiddling around with your scale. What note combinations sound good to you? Where are good places for big, dramatic bends or slides? Remember -- the blues is about personal expression, so just be yourself and start playing.









If you've never improvised before, try to erase the desire to make everything sound good. This process is about making mistakes and taking risks, then keeping the bits and licks that sounded great.

, A great guitar lick slides into the song and gets out without muddling other instruments or the singer. A good way to think about this is the classic ""call and response"" blues format, where you use your guitar to ""talk"" with the singer or other players. Just like you would never talk over someone else, try not to play over them.









In the twelve bar blues, you most frequently have space during the 4th, 8th, and 11th & 12th bars, as they are the turnaround measures., Take a standard 12-bar blues in E, for example. The progression, through the twelve bars, is E-E-E-E-A-A-E-E-B-A-E-B. Knowing this, you should try and hit the root notes whenever that measure begins, basing your riff around the chord in the measure. Find all the root notes of your song before beginning, using them as a road map for the rest of the song.









Learn the rhythm guitar part for your song as well -- knowing the chord changes forwards and backwards will make you a much better player overall.

Use an abrasive blaster.,
Use an ultrasonic cleaner.",How to Remove Chrome Plating1," Abrasive blasting (e.g., sand blasting, bead blasting, etc.) is a process by which materials are abraded with a spray of fine-grain powder or tiny pellets. Often, auto body shops and construction companies will have access to such devices. Prolonged abrasive blasting can remove an object's chrome finish, though touch-up work may need to be done on the object's hard-to-reach areas afterwords.


You may want to use a relatively fine-grain medium (for instance, 400-grit sand) when blasting your chrome to prevent damage to the underlying metal.
Note that the airborne dust and sediment produced by chipping off tiny pieces of chrome while using an abrasive blaster can be toxic, so use appropriate face/mouth protection.;
, Ultrasonic cleaners are special devices that use sound waves to clean delicate, difficult-to-clean items like jewelry. Ultrasonic cleaners can even remove chrome in some situations (especially when the chrome has already been loosened with another method). Place chrome items in the ultrasonic cleaner's basket and submerge them in a cleaning solution (often ordinary water), then allow the cleaner to run according to its instructions.


Using a solvent that can dissolve chrome (for instance, bleach, as noted above) rather than water can enhance the chrome-removing power of an ultrasonic cleaner. However, only do so if the solution you use will not corrode the cleaner or otherwise react with it in any way. For instance, as noted below, lye will react with aluminum containers.
Note that, while ultrasound machines come in a variety of sizes, most will only hold relatively small items, such as jewelry, lug-nuts, tools, ornaments, etc.

Review the basic blues riff to build the following riffs into your playing.,
Use single-note lines in the last measure before a chord change.,
Create excitement in your play by dropping to the high-pitched notes after deep power chords.,
Try some hybrid picking to get extra notes and tones into your playing.,
Use an arpeggiated seventh chord to get through the turnaround.,
Focus on great note selection, not just fast playing, to really learn the blues.",How to Add Licks to a Blues Riff2," The riffs and notes below are all variations on an intermediate blues rhythm riff in the key of E. Rather than reteach the entire rhythm section, you're encouraged to either review it yourself or simply use the licks below as a guide, fitting them into your play wherever you like.









This lick basically uses power chords to mimic the chords in the blues. You can use these chords through the entire song.

, A single-note line is when you just play multiple individual notes one after the other -- it is not a solo made up of only one note. After hitting your few chords, or listening to the rhythm player/singer hit them, you can play 5-6 notes from the pentatonic scale, any notes, for a screaming ""mini solo."" A good solid bend, ending on the next chord to get out of your lick and into the next measure is always welcome in the blues.








, This interplay between low and high creates tension and excitement in your licks. Look at the following riff, for example, which uses a deep E power chord to jump into some squealing, bluesy notes.









e |-------0-0-0---------------------------|
B |------/5-5-5---------------------------|
G |----------------2p0---------2-3------|
D |--2-------------------2----------------|
A |--2------------------------------------|
E |--0------------------------------------|

, Pick the 1st and 3rd strings with the pinky and ring finger of your strumming hand. It is a great way to alternate deep notes that you pick normally (like the 6th and 5th string) while juxtaposing higher pitched licks and notes into the solo. Really talented players can hold power chords up top, then use hybrid picking to add licks to their own rhythm playing. To practice, try the lick above with hybrid picking.








, Arpeggiated simply means you pick every note individually instead of strumming. Hitting the V chord, right before the song comes around to the root, and picking each note slowly throughout this final measure, is a slick little lick out of the twelfth bar. In the key of E, this final chord is a B. Make it a B7 for your final lick:









--2--
--0--
--2--
--1--
--2--
--X--

Note: You can do this with any turnaround in any key, as long as you know what the final chord is., A great blues lick is not necessarily the speediest playing, nor is it the most flashy. Look, for example, at B.B. King-- he could play as fast as anyone, yet the crowds go the wildest over 1-2 well-bent, well-placed notes. The blues is about feel and emotion. So put some thought into every note to really improve. Think about using:










Bends: Bent notes are essential for blues playing, as they give the emotion and power needed to really make your notes stand out.

Vibrato: Bending a note back and forth, ""shaking"" it, gives it a warbly, bluesy tone that makes the note stand out.

Slides: A slide up or down the neck is a great way to make the guitar ""whine"" getting high and emotional. It is also a good way to move quickly through the scale."

Use hydrochloric acid (muriatic acid).,
Use sodium hydroxide (lye) to strip chrome from ferrous metals and carbon steel.,
Perform a reverse electroplating.",How to Remove Chrome Plating2," Hydrochloric, or muriatic, acid, is a strong, corrosive acid. In high concentrations, it can be used to remove chrome plating from metal objects. For removing chrome, an acid solution of about 30-40% concentration should suffice. Proceed as below:


Mix 1/3 part hydrochloric acid to 1 part water in a vat used for chemical mixtures (like a heavy-duty plastic bucket, etc.) to produce a 30% acid solution. Alternatively, purchase a pre-mixed acid solution of sufficient concentration.
Submerge the chrome-plated object in the solution until chrome strips off.
Wash the object thoroughly in soap and water, and rinse before drying.

, Sodium hydroxide, commonly called lye, is a caustic, highly basic chemical. It can dissolve several types of metal plating, including chrome, but reacts dangerously with water and aluminum, corroding the aluminum itself and producing flammable hydrogen gas. Thus, it should only be used on items that do not use aluminum as a base material. Proceed as below:


Mix 8 to 12 fl ounces (about 227 ml to 355 ml) of sodium hydroxide with 1 gallon (3.785 L) of water in a vat made of neutral material (like a heavy-duty plastic bucket).
Soak the chrome-plated object in solution until chrome comes off. This may take a fairly long time, so frequently check on your item's progress.
Wash the object thoroughly in soap and water, and rinse before drying.

, Chrome is affixed to metal through the process of electroplating, in which electric current is used to bind chrome to the metal at a molecular level. By reversing this process, chrome plating can be removed extremely effectively. However, doing so can be extremely dangerous. Not only does the process involve a live electric current, but also produces several toxic, carcinogenic chemicals as products of the reaction. Hexavalent chromium, for instance, is one extremely dangerous product. Thus, this process is best left to professionals - the steps below are for informative purposes only.


Mix chromic acid and sulfuric acid in water in an approximately 100:1 ratio. For example, you may add 33 oz. (936 grams) of chromic acid crystals and .33 oz. (9.36 milliliter) of sulfuric acid fluid to distilled water to make 1 gallon (3.79 liter). Mix solution in a proper immersion tank used for electroplating, materials testing, and/or chemical treatments.
Heat the solution. Keep the temperature of the solution from 95 to 115 degrees Fahrenheit (35 to 46 degrees Celsius) for decorative chrome. Keep temperature from 120 to 150 degrees Fahrenheit (49 to 66 degrees Celsius) for hard chrome.
Run a negative charge from a DC power source through the chromic plating solution via wire.
Attach the positive cathode to object intended for stripping and submerge the object into the solution. The positively charged exterior chrome metal will be pulled from the object.
Rinse object in agitating running water, then rinse again. Have waste products professionally processed and disposed of.

Use a homemade abrasive to remove especially thin or weak chrome.,
Use oven cleaner.,
Soak the chromed item in household bleach.,
Use brake fluid to remove chrome plating.",How to Remove Chrome Plating3," One of the simplest, most beginner-friendly ways to remove chrome is via simple mechanical action - i.e., scrubbing with an abrasive. Mix baking soda or a solid household cleanser with water to make an abrasive paste that can be rubbed onto the chrome with a soft cloth until the chrome begins to give way. This method may work best with especially thin, weak chrome plating or with ""fake"" chrome plating (for example, plastic painted with a fake ""chrome"" material). Even in these cases, considerable elbow grease may be required.


Check your progress frequently as you scrub. Scrubbing for too long may scratch the underlying material.

, Some types of chrome (especially fake plastic variants like you may find on model cars, etc.) can be removed with commercial-grade oven cleaners. These powerful de-greasing solutions usually come in an aerosol can as a foam or liquid spray. Give your chrome part a generous coating of cleaner, then allow it to sit for 10 minutes. Wipe the chrome off along with the spray-cleaner.


Note that some oven spray-cleaner may darken any underlying metal if left to sit too long, so you may want to apply the process repeatedly in short increments until you have the result you want.

, Another favorite method of model car enthusiasts for removing chrome is the use of a bleach bath. In this method, chromed parts are simply submerged bleach and left to sit. After about a day, depending on its thickness, the chrome should be loosened if not stripped entirely.


The primary benefit of this method compared to the others is that bleach should leave any primer below the outer chrome layer intact.
After using bleach to remove chrome, it should be properly disposed of and never re-used (for laundry, etc.)

, Standard automotive brake fluid works like paint thinner to remove chrome layers from plastic objects. However, this method can take several days to work. Additionally, it requires the proper handling and disposal of the brake fluid, which is toxic. Rub the chrome object with brake fluid and let it set about 10 minutes before rinsing it off. Repeat as needed to completely strip the chrome.


Note that brake fluid can dissolve plastic, so be very cautious when using this method on chromed plastic parts (or opt for another method).

Get a book (optional).,
Understand what switchers are.,
Get to know road-switchers.,
Consider cab units.",How to Identify Spotting Features Among Diesel Locomotives," If you are entirely new to identifying diesel locomotives, pick up a good book (one of the best to get started is Brian Solomon's ""American Diesel Locomotive"") on the subject to get yourself familiar with the various locomotive manufacturers with the most common names being: the American Locomotive Company (ALCo), Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton Locomotive Works(BLH), Fairbanks-Morse (F-M), General Motors' Electro-Motive Division (EMD), and General Electric (GE). This type of book will usually provide descriptions, illustrations of locomotives and photographs.


Today, only the latter two companies still produce diesel locomotives, although at least a few models built by all of the companies listed above still operate in some capacity. In any event, for purposes of time this article will only highlight the general differing spotting features among different manufacturers and model types. Diesel locomotives have three basic types; switchers, road switchers, and cab units which usually feature some type of streamlining and a full-length hood with no ""porch"" or walkway alongside the locomotive.;
, Switchers are usually small locomotives built with one purpose in mind. That purpose is movement of cars in a specific area. However, this didn't limit them to just that. Switchers are also used to run short freight in order to unload and load cargo from nearby industries. Quite a handful still operate today, especially in industrial settings.

Among switchers, models built by EMD, as are most of their locomotives in general, feature smooth, distinct lines and contours with the cab set to one end of the locomotive with a signature conical stack(s) protruding from the top of the hood. Except for a few models, EMD's switchers were short, typically only around 45 or so feet in length. Models included: SW-1, NW-2, SW-7, SW-9, SW-1200, and SW-1500.
GE's switchers were distinct and very short. While their larger 70-ton model featured an end-cab design, their switchers were commonly center-aligned. They were highly sought for industrial work since their very small dimensions allowed them to negotiate tight curves and clearances often found within plants and other industrial workplaces. Models included the 44-ton and 45-ton.
ALCo's switchers, as with most of their models, are defined aesthetically by rounded corners and roof lines. Their ""S"" and ""T"" models featured end-cabs and one single stack protruding from the roof with the latter model featuring a notched nose for the number boards. While technically a road-switcher, Alco's very popular RS series was often used by railroads in switching service. Featuring a cab offset to one end and a long hood with its trademark rounded edges and lines, the RS series is still universally recognized today.
BLH's S-12 featured an end-cab design with a very long sweeping front hood and extended front step leading out of the cab. Never very popular, only a handful of these machines still operate today.
F-M's switcher models included the H-10-44 and the H-12-44, which featured an end-cab design that rose flush with the top of the long hood, with the edges rounded off.

, Road-switchers are basically what the name suggests. They usually work freight trains, moving goods between yards. However, their general design allow them to be safely operated as switchers in those yards. In regards to the first and second-generation models, EMD and GE locomotives are the most easily recognizable.

EMD's designs, as usually found on first- and second-gen units, are typically very clean in look with an angled and pointed short front hoods with a finished angled-off appearance to the rear of the long hood. Perhaps the most distinguishable feature is the angled protruding dynamic brake housing centered on top of the long hood and a smooth, semi-streamlined fuel tank. Such models include the GP-7, GP-9, GP-20, GP-30, GP-40, and GP-50. More modern units have a much more drastic look compared to older units. One key difference between them is a stubby, short front hood that could be said to be streamlined. They look comparatively like GE's newer models.
GE's older models were about the general shape as EMD's GP-7 and GP-9: boxy. The Universal series exemplifies this description. However, like modern EMD designs, newer GE units are vastly different from their predecessors, as they are very boxy in appearance with clean, crisp lines, sharp angles, stubby, short front hoods and often-""winged"" radiator housings in appearance protruding from the rear of the long hood (one of a modern freight diesel's most distinguishing features).
ALCo locomotives are typically easily identified by their rounded edges and notched features on the front and rear of the locomotive. Common models included: RS-2, RS-3, RSD-4/5, RS-11, and RS-15. Their large Century series road-switchers are very bulky and tall in appearance, but can usually be identified from GEs and EMDs by their rounded cab roofs, short, stubby short front hood and protruding front number plates directly above the windshield. These models included: C420, C424, C415, and C628.
F-M's most popular road-switcher was the H-24-66, the Train Master. It was very tall, bulky and boxy featuring an offset cab that rose flush with the roof line. Similar, but somewhat smaller locomotives included the H-16-44 and the H-16-66 models.

, In North American railroading, cab units are generally streamlined locomotives that have one cab at the extreme end, offering a great view of the road ahead and an extremely limited view behind. Cab units are generally considered as road-only units due to the extreme lack of rearward visibility, and as so, are rarely seen switching a yard if they are even used as so.

EMD's first- and second-gen cab units were easily the most popular as their E and F series diesels sold by the thousands. These models are easily recognizable by their clean, ""bull dog""-like noses and portholes along their flanks. Both models featured very streamlined car bodies making them all ideal for passenger service although the E series was particularly equipped for the purpose. Their latest cab unit diesel appeared on the market not too long ago as the F125, presumably numbered after its max speed. The shape is reminiscent of GE's Genesis series, with a beveled edge at the cab end of the locomotive.
Alco's cab units may not have been as popular but were striking nonetheless. Their FA (for freight service) and PA (for passenger service) models featured very automobile-like styling with a long, sweeping front nose and rounded windshields. The PA was generally considered the most striking and has often been credited as the most beautiful diesel locomotive ever built.
FM's “Consolidation Line” was a short line of diesels which introduced the company to the cab unit world. The model, built to both freight and passenger specifications featured a short, almost stubby front nose that was somewhat rounded but also pointed. It only sold a few hundred units and was never very popular. Another F-M cab unit was the Erie-built, named as it was built in Erie, PA.

Crimp the terminal lug onto the cable using a flat nail punch or a crimper.,
Using a flame or other high-heat source (such as from a butane torch), heat the lug until the rosin flux is boiling.,
Still applying heat, solder around the connection between cable and terminal lug.,
Slide the shrink tubing back up to cover the expose metal, then use the heat source to shrink it around the connection.,
Clamp the terminals in a vice, open side up.,
Liberally swab the inside of the terminal and the outside of the cable with rosin flux.,
Using your torch, heat the terminal so that the rosin flux is boiling.,
Preheat the end of the cable for 12-15 seconds, then push it into the terminal.,
Solder the connection between terminal and wire.,
Use some wire cutters to clean up any exposed strands of wiring.,
Slide the sheathing to cover exposed metal, then heat it to shrink it on.",How to Make Battery Cables," Before making new cables, check which ones actually need to be replaced. Remove any snapped, chipping, weak, crusty, or otherwise bad-looking cables so you know what needs to be replaced.;
, On the cable should be a number with a slash in it, like ""2 / 0,"" followed by the letters ""AWG."" The terminals should have this slashed number too. This number is the gauge size. The terminal may not, however, say ""AWG."" Make sure you purchase both a positive and negative terminal.If your cables don't match the battery, you can also get cable clamp adjusters, which tighten around any cable to ensure it fits well.
Non-adjustable terminals or ""universal"" terminals should only be used as a temporary fix., Different cables need to be used for different machinery. While there are a lot of options out there, the general strategy is easy to remember:



Dry Machines (Cars, tractors, etc.) need to use untreated copper wire.

Wet machines (boats, jet skis, etc.) need to use electroplated (""tinned"") strands to prevent rusting., Rosin core solder wire is the safest to use on your battery connections. Acidic connections or active core wires can cause issues and corrode the battery when exposed to electricity.

, Like the solder wire, this paste is too corrosive to be useful with copper or tinned wired.Some companies actually sell terminals pre-loaded with flux and solder.

, Bring in the bad battery cables to ensure you get the right replacements for your car or boat if you don't know what to get. If in doubt, talk to a store clerk for help replacing parts. Bring in your car's make, model, and year to help them understand your specific motor. You'll need:


Two cable, brass or tinned
Two terminal lugnuts
Two terminals
Solder
Rosin paste or fluid
Shrinkable sheathing, cut in four 6"" parts., Don't try saw at the cable with a knife of hacksaw, as this makes for jagged, uneven ends of cable that are hard to work with. Use a heavy-duty set of cutters to get right through the cable in one short, smooth motion., Cut lightly here, trying your best to only cut the rubber housing and not the strands of cable underneath. You can use your terminal lugs (the piece that attached to the battery) to estimate how much you should cut away. Simply line it up with the cable and note how long the hole is, then cut away enough rubber so that the actual metal cable fits in snugly.


Don't worry if you cut too much away -- you will be re-sheathing the cables later.

, Removing these stray bits will slow down corrosion and greatly increase the life of your cable., It is harder to get this sheathing on after the terminals are attached, so slide it onto the wire now and roll it out of the way, towards the center of the cable. Each one of these sheathings will cover the exposed metal at the ends of your cable when done., This paste is heated up and creates a strong electrical connections between the two bits. Apply the paste liberally with a cotton swab.

, Some of the flux will squeeze out, but this is okay. Get the lug snugly onto the exposed cable for now., If you have a crimping machine, now is the time to use it. Otherwise, get a flat nail punch or angle iron, and a hammer. Place the punch in the center of the nut, then hammer hard into it to crimp the terminal into the cabling. Flip the cable and repeat on the other side.

, You want to get the entire piece nice and hot. You can stand a butane torch up, turn it on, and rotate the cable in front of the flame so the whole thing is evenly heated. Heat until the rosin starts to bubble out of the terminal lug.


This preheats everything to make soldering easier in the next step.

, Use your non-acidic, non-reactive solder wire to solder the point where the terminal lug ends and the exposed cable begins. You can do this right after you have the rosin boiling. When done, let it cool for 1-2 minutes before proceeding.


Make sure you have enough heat to liquefy the solder.

, All that needs to be exposed is the flat terminal lug, which connects to the battery. The rest of the connection should be covered and snugly fit with the sheathing to prevent corrosion.

, The entire terminal is going to get very hot, and you can't attach it and crimp it down ahead of time like the terminal lugs. Clamp it down so it won't move as you insert the hot cable and solder.

, The ""ingredients"" needed to attach the terminals are the exact same as those used for the lugs, though the process is a bit different. Use a cotton swab to coat all parts of the terminal and wire that will connect.


If you bought pre-soldered and pre-rosined terminals, you should skip this step.

, Make sure you do this in a well-ventilated area. You want big, quick bubbles forming to know you have it boiling., If both the cable and the terminal are hot, the connection is going to be much faster and more secure.

, Just like the terminal lug, solder the edge of the terminal to the expose wire beneath it. Even if you have pre-soldered connections, this isn't a terrible idea for added security.

, If some of the strands of wire came loose when inserting the cable into the terminal, strip them off before moving on., These sheathings will greatly increase the usable life of your battery cables."

Be sarcastic.,
Look at life realistically.,
Be eccentric.,
Act confident.,
Hide your compassion behind a gruff exterior.",How to Act Like Dr. Gregory House1," One of Dr. House’s most defining characteristics is his sarcastic sense of humor. Instead of telling side-splitting jokes, be humorous in a way that is understated and subtle. Respond to situations that you are in with ironic comments and intelligent quips.For instance, at one point when another character is trying to have a serious conversation with Dr. House about his emotions, Dr. House says, ""Did you come for my feelings? Because I left 'em in my other pants.""Dr. House often verges on rudeness when he makes sarcastic comments about other people. This is something you may want to avoid in your own life, as he often rubs people the wrong way.;
, Dr. House is a long way from an optimist. He sees the dark in the world as well as the light. Though being a realist is a difficult thing to teach yourself, try not to be naïve about other people and the world at large.One quote that illustrates Dr. House's life philosophy is: ""Welcome to the world. Everyone's different, everyone gets treated different. You try fighting that, you end up dying of TB.""Learn more about psychology to understand the underlining motivations behind people and society in general.
If you ever start feeling too pessimistic, stop and remember that there are other aspects of Dr. House’s personality that you channel.

, Dr. House isn’t afraid of other people noticing him or thinking that he’s strange. He often does odd and outlandish things, not caring how others see him and sometimes even relishing their confusion. If you ever get the urge to do or say something eccentric, don’t hold yourself back!For instance, if you are standing in a very long line at the DMV, you could say loudly, “Do you think Santa will let me sit on his lap?” Smile exaggeratedly at anyone who looks around at you.

, No matter what situation you’re in, be confident and outspoken. Dr. House is tremendously confident in himself, even though he does acknowledge his flaws. He is assured of his intelligence and the fact that he often is the most learned person in the room.Try to be quietly confident as opposed to being openly boastful. Bragging about your skills and intelligence or acting like certain situations are below you can alienate others.

, As prickly as Dr. House can sometimes be, he does genuinely want his patients to get better. In your daily life, even if you are sarcastic with those around you, try your best to help others, even if your help is behind the scenes rather than out in the open.

In your work place, do your best to master all aspects of your field and be the one that people consult if they are faced with a tough problem., One thing that comes with being the boss is the ability to bend rules. Even though he works in a hospital with rigidly structured regulations, Dr. House often goes around established procedures and runs things his way. Ultimately, skirting the rules helps Dr. House figure out his medical problems faster, often saving his patient. His rule-breaking therefore improves the quality of his care and is not only for personal gain.It’s not worth getting in trouble just to emulate Dr. House. Carefully analyze the way your workplace is run before you break the rules, and only do so if it helps your company or business run better.

, Dr. House never shrinks away from a challenge. In fact, he relishes a difficult problem and is bored by easy fixes. Dr. House’s enthusiasm for intellectual challenge is what contributes to his expertise as a doctor.At your own workplace, take on difficult or challenging projects that others don’t want to do. These projects will help you grow professionally and will cement your status as an expert in your field.

, Even though Dr. House is often presented with emotional situations, such as terminal illness in his patients, he doesn’t let his emotions get in the way of his judgment when trying to find a solution for their problems.In your own workplace, show empathy towards customers or clients, but don’t let your feelings affect your analysis of the situation.

, Dr. Wilson is Dr. House’s sidekick and second in command at the hospital. Dr. House approaches Dr. Wilson when he needs support and help with moral issues. At your own workplace, start friendship with someone who you like and is professionally competent. Turn to them if you are in need of help or guidance."

Assemble a team.,
Brainstorm before taking action.,
Try the simplest solution first.,
Stick to your ideas.,
Use trial and error.",How to Act Like Dr. Gregory House3," Though he is a brilliant doctor, Dr. House needs his team around him to help him solve tough problems. Even if he eventually solves the problem himself, he often arrives to his conclusion only after having a problem-solving session with his team of doctors, in which they talk about possible diagnoses of the patient and what could be done to improve their condition.Even if your work environment isn’t naturally structured with departments or teams, still try to get the input of your coworkers when working to solve a problem.
Assemble a group of people with different skills and expertise so that everyone has something useful to contribute.

, Dr. House has a whiteboard he uses in many episodes to write out all the suggestions and ideas of himself and his team. He uses the whiteboard to make connections between different ideas and come up with creative solutions. Start planning out projects or plans on a whiteboard to help you make connections and visualize your solution.List out all aspects of a project or a problem on one side, and all solutions on the other. Then try to branch out or connect both sides.

, Dr. House approaches problem solving using a concept called Occam's Razor, which states that simplest theory is the best starting place for solving a problem. Once you come up with a list of potential solutions, use the one that is most likely to fix the problem. Dr. House always uses a practical approach and acts on the most likely diagnosis.Don't forget about human error. As Dr. House said, ""Occam's Razor. The simplest explanation is almost always that somebody screwed up."", Dr. House is incredibly stubborn, almost to a fault. If you have a possible solution to a problem that you are sure of, stick to it and don’t let others talk you down. Still be open to the ideas and suggestions of others, but always keep your original idea in mind and don’t compromise without first trying to win others over to your side.


In season three, Dr. House says to his colleague only somewhat jokingly, ""I thought I'd get your theories, mock them, then embrace my own. The usual."", Move on to a different solution if the first one doesn’t work. Because Dr. House is always given the most difficult cases at the hospital, he often has to test out several solutions before finding the most successful one. Don’t be afraid to change your approach and try out different ways of tackling a problem."

",How to Start an Auto Transporting Business," There are auto transporting businesses that provide open car transport for regular vehicles, specialized auto transporting businesses that offer enclosed car transport for vintage and exotic vehicles, and those that provide both types. Open car transport utilizes car haulers on which the vehicles are exposed to the elements, while enclosed car transport makes use of special car haulers that are sealed on all sides to protect the cars inside.;
, If a competitor already covers a large part of the market, consider specializing in one specific niche such as vintage car transport.

,,,, In most countries, these are issued by the Department of Transportation.

, When starting an auto transporting business, you're required to carry insurance on each cargo, though the amount will vary depending on your location.

, You'll need good access to major routes as well as sufficient room to load and unload the car haulers. Check with your city to make sure you comply with local zoning laws.

,,


For a regular auto transporting business, purchase at least one open car hauler.
For a specialized auto transporting business, purchase at least one enclosed car hauler, a winch, hydraulic liftgate, and high-strength tie-down straps.

, This means that they can hire you to transport cargo for them.

Draw a circle around the damaged area.,

Using a preferred method cut out the aluminum within the circle drawn around the damage.,
Cut out a circular patch from a sheet of aluminum that is the same thickness and the original aircraft skin.,
Center the patch over the hole in the aircraft skin and mark its outline.

Since the aluminum being used here is 0.040” thick, and the rivets are 4/32"" in diameter.,
Once the edge distance lines are drawn, it’s time to mark the location of each rivet.,
Next, drill pilot holes where the rivet makings are located with a small drill bit so it is possible to drill the holes to full size, without deformation of the aluminum sheet.

,
Secure the patch on the aircraft skin and drill pilot holes in the patch.,
With the patch still secured to the aircraft skin, expand the holes to the proper diameter.,
Remove the patch from the aircraft skin and deburr all the holes both on the patch and on the aircraft skin.

,
Once deburred, re-secure the patch on the skin using clecos.

,
Using the proper rivets, secure the patch to the aircraft skin.

",How to Repair Minor Aircraft Skin Damage,";
,, Debur the newly cut hole.

, The diameter will depend on the number of rows of rivets you’re planning on installing. Debur the outer edge of the patch.

,, The edge distance for riveting will be ¼”. The patch cut for this repair is big enough in diameter for 2 rows of rivets, so I will draw a line 1/4” from the small hole and ¼’’ inward from the outline of the patch I drew.

, The rule for rivet spacing is a minimum of 4 times the diameter of the rivet and a maximum of 12 times the diameter of the rivet. You’ll also want to keep the spacing between each rivet the same. Just make sure you’re within those limits.

,, Use the holes previously drilled in the skin as a guide.

, Use clecos to make sure the patch does not move while drilling.

Keep in mind that your display area will need to be inspected before you can open your online dealership., These fees may total around $116. Check to make sure new fees have not been added. You can call your local inspector's office to make sure. These fees may include:A $5 non-refundable application fee
A $50 Reinstatement fee
A $15 Duplicate or transfer license fee

You may want to consider limiting your live chat hours to regular business hours, such as Monday through Friday from 8am-5pm, or hiring someone to manage the live chat when you cannot.

, Plenty of great, high-quality photos are essential for an online car dealership. Your website visitors are going to expect to be able to look at many photos of a car before they decide to buy, so you may want to invest in a good camera.Photograph your vehicles from many different angles and include interior photos as well. Your website visitors should be able to see the vehicles on your website from every angle.
Clean your vehicles on the inside and the outside before photographing them. Dust and dirt can make a car seem less appealing to your online visitors, to take the time to deep clean each of your cars before you photograph them.
Take photos of your vehicles outside as the sun is setting or rising to get the best light. Natural light will help to make your photos look more professional and the details of the car will be easier to see., Since you cannot show website visitors all of the features of your vehicles, you will need to include some detailed descriptions. Make your descriptions as detailed as possible. Include information about each vehicle’s features and any other information that website visitors might want to know. Some things you may want to include are:


year, make, and model
mileage
details about how the vehicle runs
basic features such as horsepower, whether it is automatic or manual, whether is it two-wheel or four-wheel drive, etc.
special features such as power windows, power locks, sound system, etc.

You can now blow the compressed air through all passageways in the carb to make sure no more clogs are in there.,
Now that the internals have been all cleaned out you can clean out the bowl and underside of the carburetor to make sure no more dirt gets back through your freshly cleaned carb.,
You can now re-install the float and pin.,

, It is attached to the carb with usually 3 or 4 Phillips screws on the bottom. Once removed you can now see the internals of your carburetor. If the inside of the bowl is dirty, you know that you carburetor inside are likely to be as well.

, It is held in by the pin, that can be pushed through and the float will lift out. You can see at this point if the float isn't moving freely you could have a sticky float resulting in excessive flooding of the engine. Make sure this is working freely on re-install.

, first you can remove the high speed jet (the one with the slot on top). It is removed with a flat screwdriver. Once removed you can look at it against a light and see if it is clogged or not. If this is you can soak it for a minute in engine degreaser and then hit it with compressed air to blast out the debris. This may need to be done a few times until fully clear of dirt. Once clean, re-install make sure not to tighten excessively.

, It is usually the one sticking up higher, and usually a hex headed 1/4"" brass jet.urn it out of the carb and inspect for a clogged passage. You can soak it in degreaser and blast it with compressed air as well. Repeat that to make sure it is cleaned right out. Look down the passage where the main jet came from and blast air down to clean it out as well. Now you can re-install the main jet.

, Remove linkage and lubricate to help in ease of operation. Clean intake of carburetor so no debris gets into the engine.

, Do all the jets, intake ports, idle ports, overflow ports and where ever you can blow the air. Blow the hole carb out to loosen and remove all the tiny particles of debris.

, You can soak the bowl in some degreaser to loosen some stuck on dirt. Be sure to wipe and clean all dirt at this stage so that no more gets inside. This will later help in less problems with clogged up internals.

, Now you can make sure that your pin is lubed with WD or whichever you choose to make that float operation smoother. Just a little spray on the pin and where it meets the float will help so much. Push the pin through the post coming from the carburetor and through the float mount and back through the other side post. No need to fasten it there because once the bowl is installed it will hold it all together.

, Once re-installed check final operation of the choke and blow last bits of dirt away. You can also hear the float moving if you shake it easily. Once all clean you can install you fuel lines and vent hoses and its all ready for re-installation on the vehicle!

Identify the Right Charter Broker or Operator.,
""There are a number of charter brokers who appear to have many aircraft but in reality are serving in a capacity similar to a travel agent."",
Charter brokers are not FAA authorized and do not have any aircraft under their control.,
Validate the Charter Company.,
Visit the Company: This may not always be possible, but you will learn a tremendous amount of information about a company by meeting their people, seeing their facility, and touring a few aircraft.,
Look for Good Customer Service: Ideally, there should be a single person responsible for your trip.,
Select an Aircraft: Often, a charter company will provide pictures of an aircraft under consideration for a trip.,
Check up on your Pilot: Find out what the provider's standards are for minimum pilot hours.,
Find Out How Much it Will Cost: As the details of your needs become more specific, you should be able to get a clear quote, not a vague estimate that leaves room for surprises on the final invoice.",How to Choose a Private Jet Charter Company," Yes, one could check the local Yellow Pages or a favorite search engine to locate charter companies. However, there won’t be any information about the quality of individual companies there, other than what is written in advertisements created by the companies themselves. Use the web to look for online directories of FAA authorized charter operators, charter brokers and their locations, and the various aircraft they offer.;
, This statement is true. Brokers do not have operational control over any aircraft. They get quotes from operators, put their fee on top of that and retail it.

, If you like the idea of using a travel agent, keep in mind that a quality FAA authorized operator can access a jet anywhere in the world just like a broker. Now that you have a list of operators, their aircraft, and phone numbers, you need to ask a few basic questions.

, The next step is verifying the charter company’s advertising claims through official documentation. In order to simplify this complicated task, one can break down the process into three categories: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) documentation, insurance and third-party audits.

FAA Documentation – Each charter company must have a valid Part 135 air taxi certificate which authorizes it to fly for hire. Obtaining a Part 135 certificate requires the charter company to adhere to FAA guidelines and is strictly enforced by the FAA. Ask for a copy of their ""Air Carrier Certificate"" which is the official document granted by the FAA. If a charter company does not have an air carrier certificate, they are not authorized by the FAA to conduct charter operations.






Insurance – Often overlooked, insurance can provide a great deal of information about a charter company. Typical limits for a charter company are $50M-$100m for a small jet (such as a Cessna Citation, Lear 40 or Hawker 400XP), $100M for a mid-sized jet (such as a Hawker 800XP, Lear 60 or Citation XL) and $100M-$500M for a large jet (such as a Challenger, Gulfstream or Falcon). Often, these higher insurance limits require an audit by the insurance company to assure that the pilots and mechanics have the appropriate experience to operate a safe flight. Also, another free service most operators will offer is for the passenger to be “named additional insured” on the policy. This option is really a personal decision. It should be considered if the passenger flies private charter on an ongoing, regular basis.






Third Party Audits – There are several companies that specialize in auditing charter companies. The industry’s most used services are Aviation Research Group (ARG/US) or Wyvern. ARG/US & Wyvern compile several databases, including FAA, Department of Transportation (DOT) and one on aircraft transactions, to determine the safety records of the operator, its pilots and its aircraft. In addition, these companies will perform on-site audits on safety procedures, aircraft log books and additional documentation. The only way to verify that an operator has been audited by one of these organizations is to contact ARG/US or Wyvern directly.







, Viewing people and facilities will tell you a lot about the quality of aircraft and level of service you can expect from the charter company.

, Also, live help should be available around the clock for if you must change your plans, make a special request, or ask a question. You will get a great sense of their level of service by how you are treated on the phone. Does the agent take time with you, ask questions to ensure they understand what is important to you, are they polite, and most importantly, are they responsive.

, Be warned, however, that pictures are deceiving and may not be current. The only way absolutely ensure the status of an aircraft is to view it personally.Also, because insurance levels can change at any time and vary by aircraft within the same fleet, it is important to ask for a copy of the insurance policy before each and every flight.

, Different jet types require different pilot hours. Once you have chosen an aircraft, verify that the assigned pilot has the required number of pilot hours on that type of craft. Generally, each captain should have at least 5000 total flight hours and 300 hours in the specific aircraft type. Ask how often the pilots attend recurrent training in a full-motion simulator. Once every six months is considered ideal. Anything less, the pilot may not be as fresh as possible on the latest procedures.

, Any always ask for a hard quote. Yes, certain things such as catering, ground transportation, and flight phone usage are not known before the flight, but everything else should be a firm quote so you are not surprised by the final billing.

Make your final payment and schedule a pickup of your plane.",How to Buy a Used Airplane," Determine what your needs are now, not what you expect them to be in the future. Are you going to use the airplane primarily for family trips, or will it be used for business? Also consider your budget.


What you pay for an aircraft is only part of the cost of ownership. Don’t forget to include the cost of operation and maintenance. Too many pilots don’t have a definite amount set for what they are willing to spend.
As a result, they keep increasing what they are willing to spend as they come across airplanes that are just beyond their financial reach.;
, Once you have picked out a specific aircraft type that will meet your needs and budget, start comparing individual craft. Here are some factors that can affect your buying decision.


Total time: The lower total time the more expensive the aircraft. Aircraft Blue Book and the Aircraft Value Reference, Vref, have formulas to help you determine how total time affects the price of an aircraft. Engine time: Aircraft engines have a life expectancy known as TBO (Time Before Overhaul) established by the manufacturer. This number reflects when the average engine will need an overhaul. Exterior/Interior condition: What is the overall condition of the plane? Look for things like corrosion or the condition of the seats. Avionics: The condition of the avionics can make a difference in the value of a plane. Aircraft Blue Book and Vref have formulas for calculating the value of avionics.

, Knowing the history of an aircraft is important. Get as much information related to the aircraft as possible. This will include specifications, maintenance history, damage, etc. Aircraft with damage may still be a good craft, but you might want to consult a broker to help you determine the true value.

, Leave the window open and listen as you crank up the engine. Check the gauges during takeoff and get a feel for the aircraft in flight. Make sure to check that all the avionics are functioning properly.

, Once you have chosen the airplane you want you will need to put down a deposit to take it off the market. This can be done through an escrow service if you are not comfortable with handing your money over directly to the seller. You should be agreeable to the terms of the sale and make sure your money is refundable in the event the deal falls apart.

, This is the responsibility of the buyer and a good investment. Hire a trusted mechanic to give the aircraft a thorough inspection. Provide the mechanic with a list of the craft’s specifications along with a pre-purchase inspection checklist (some financing companies require this).

, Make certain there are no old liens on the aircraft before you purchase it.

, Shop around for a good insurance policy. Your experience level as a pilot plays a major role in the type of aircraft you can get insurance for. Speaking with an insurance agent ahead of time will let you know if you are wasting your time looking at aircraft you won’t be able to get insured.

, Finally, enjoy your new aircraft.

",How to Build an Airplane,";
, You should know what kind of plane you want to make, so fly various types of aircraft beforehand. Reading specifications can only tell you so much, but actually experiencing what those specifications mean is completely different, especially how the desired airplane will fit your body type.

, If you want to get it in the air more quickly, you should use a preexisting design.

, A well-developed kit will also speed along the process whereas only using plans may occasionally hinder you.

, There are three main types of construction: fabric, aluminum and composite.


Fabric can be maintenance-intensive and offers slower airspeed, but is the lightest and for some may be the least difficult to build.
Aluminum is more difficult, but is somewhat maintenance-free and can make a very fast airplane.
Composite is the most difficult to build because of all the sanding to make a nice finish but generally yields the fastest airplanes.

, Take note: Designs that are straightforward and have good utility once completed are the most abundant and may represent the best choice for success.

, The most popular kits manufactures will be there. Spend most of your time there talking to owners about their experiences building and flying the plane you are interested in, rather than talking to manufacturers.

, Some planes aren't worth enough to insure for their intrinsic value, but you should still get a quote for liability. The amount they ask you to pay is their way of telling you how risky the airplane is.

, Some manufactures give demonstrator flights. Joining a local chapter of EAA could get you in contact with someone who has the plane you want to build.

, It doesn't have to be the same plane but will ideally be the same construction type, and even better the same manufacturer so you can learn the construction techniques and the quality of the kit. Don't be intrusive, as successful airplane builders are almost always time-constrained and will not want you back if you waste their time. When you decide to build your own plane you can avoid all the mistakes many builders make because you will know what you are doing from the start.

, An attached garage or large workspace in your home are the best options. Make sure you can keep the temp above 50 °F (10 °C); you can't work well with your hands below 50F.

, Now that you have your ideal workspace identified it is time to find tools. You can usually get tools from people in your local EAA chapter that have recently completed their planes. If not the kit manufacturer can point you in the right direction.

, Most kit manufactures will have you start with the tail ""feathers"" or more formally the ""empennage."" Building the empennage will offer a microcosm of the project without committing the entire cost of the project. This is a fail safe for those that didn't get help from another builder before starting construction. You may consider looking in classified adds to get a good deal on the empennage of your choice from a builder who got in over their head.

, Do not deviate unless you already have some building experience. Deviations cost time, money and sometimes lives. Generally its best to start with the tail, (shown in step 13) but always defer to the plans.

, This can also save you insurance money.

, Some items have lead times that could hurt your schedule. Experience for your insurance, engines, propellers and hangars come to mind. Find out the lead times for each of these and have these things ready when you need them. 3-6 months before you think you are going to fly your plane you need to get it registered.

, it is much easier to get 30 minutes of work done while dinner is cooking when you only have to walk 3 seconds to your workshop; besides hangars cost a lot of money. This may vary because of your workspace but try to get as much done at home as possible: engine and propeller mounted; wiring complete, and perhaps even paint. Although some prefer not to paint until after they have flown off their test time to keep the investment low and give a last chance to fix cracks in composite structures if they develop.

,,,, It is probable that you've been building so much that you have neglected your flying skills. This is a bad recipe. Go fly. This is not the time to rush. Practice unusual attitudes and engine outs. The unusual attitudes because builder pilots often get distracted in flight monkeying with some gadget that they installed when they forget to fly the plane and get into an unusual attitude. The other because you can never be too good at landing a plane with no engine.

As such, do some research on your local market to ensure that you are not wading into an overly-competitive market with many well-established used auto parts businesses.


Do an internet search, look in the local phone book, and pay close attention to advertisements on local television to identify similar businesses in your area.
Account for the size and population of your city and compare that to the geographic location of existing used auto parts businesses.
Used auto parts businesses are more likely to thrive in lower income areas, as wealthier segments of the society generally don't buy used auto parts as often.;
, Your business plan should list information about exactly how you are going to run the business, any specialty areas, how you will open and maintain your business, where you will get your car parts, and how you will price them to earn a profit. Your marketing plan should contain information about your target audience and local competition as well as how you intend to draw in your target audience.


Your specialty areas may be in imports, exports, motors, or bodywork. Do some research to determine what area can work for your business.
A used auto parts business can be particularly lucrative if you provide rare or hard to find parts for more obscure vehicles.In your business plan, be sure to account for all costs and expenditures related to the business, project realistic sales goals, design a plan to reach new customers, identify potential demographic segments of the community who will utilize your services, and plan for the growth potential of your business. Be sure outline where and how you expect to generate the necessary capital to get your business off the ground and to ensure that you can expand when needed., Make sure you acquire all the required licensing, permits, and insurance to run a used car parts business in your area. Pay attention to zoning regulations as well as state and federal guidelines.Most states require a license for businesses that buy, restore, recycle, and resell used car parts.

, Find a location for your used card parts business. As long as you have quality marketing and advertising strategies, you don't necessarily need a location that is easy for people to find. People may come looking for you because of the service you provide is so particular.You will need a location that is big enough to house and properly catalog a variety of used parts for all the makes and models of cars you cater to.Hire employees. If you are looking to open a used auto parts business, chances are that you have at least rudimentary knowledge about cars and how they work. However, you will likely need a licensed mechanic in your business to help refurbish old parts and identify parts that have potential resale value. Posting an add in local newspapers or on job search websites can help you find potential candidates for employment.

, The more you have on hand, the better. In the beginning, it may be hard to invest in the right parts. Start small, and seek parts you know people are looking for. You can also invest money in parts you know are necessary and are expensive when purchased brand-new. This way, people will more often seek out the used parts you have.


Identifying the parts you need and where to find them depends largely on your business plan. Your business may choose to focus on providing parts for rare vehicles not in production anymore, as these will be in high demand among a small segment of the population. Alternatively, you may choose to specialize in providing parts for very common vehicles in an effort to expand your potential sales base.
Try finding these parts in junkyards, from cars sold at salvage auctions, or contact insurance agencies to try to purchase ""scrapped"" cars from them at a discounted price.As a used auto parts business owner, you will need to educate yourself on the mechanics of how a car operates in order to find the right parts. Also, be prepared to test the parts you find to know if they are still operational or can be refurbished to become operational again.

, Local businesses, such as tow truck companies, junkyards and insurance companies, can help you find used car parts.


Insurance companies may be willing to sell you parts of a vehicle to recoup some of their money, especially when selling the entire vehicle is not a practical option., When a car gets totaled, there may be many valuable working parts left on the vehicle. Sometimes it may be worth it to buy an entire scrap vehicle so you can get a breakdown of motor and body parts for a specific make and model., Advertise online, on the radio, and in local newspapers. If you can afford it, consider placing a commercial on a local TV channel. Use flyers, business cards, and word-of-mouth advertising to inform people about your business. Run special promotions to celebrate your grand opening.

, One of the main goals of any business to establish a reliable customer base who will bring in repeat business. This can be particularly difficult with used auto parts businesses because the needs of customers are intermittent and specific. However, you could offer a repeat customer discount, a frequent-buyer card, or other special offers to entice customers to come back.


Offer to take the old parts from your customers who purchase their used parts from you. You may be able to salvage car parts, refurbish them for a low cost, and place them back on your shelf.
You could also consider offering a discount to customers who bring “trade-in” parts to your business.
Consider selling online. When you deal with very specific parts for specific vehicles, you may find that no one in your immediate area will need the parts you are offering. As a result, it is wise to consider listing your inventory online to reach a much wider customer base. If you do choose to sell parts online, you need to account for the cost of packaging, shipping and handling in your prices and business model.

, The success of your used auto parts business relies on managing your inventory. If customers don’t find what they need at your business, they will happily shop elsewhere. Staying profitable in the field of used auto parts requires you keep an extensive selection of parts for a wide variety of vehicles at all times.

, Monitor the flow of cash in and out of your business. Make sure you don’t spend more acquiring the parts than you make selling them. Make sure you account for the other costs your business incurs from day-to-day operations when pricing your products. Such costs include:


Paying employees and staff (if necessary)Paying rent or mortgage on your business’ propertyPaying bills, like electric, water, and gas, that are necessary to your business’ operationsPaying property taxes and insuranceAdvertising costs"

If it is to the left, the WCA is negative. In the example, the wind correction angle is +4°., Adding 4° to 175 equals 179° for the true heading., The variation is the difference between true north and magnetic north and can be found on a VFR or IFR chart. Easterly variations are subtracted and westerly variations are added. Compass deviation is printed on a placard under the magnetic compass in the airplane."

With other major possibilities being the Epcot, the Disney (Hollywood/MGM) Studios, and Disney's Animal Kingdom and the mess of water parks and other activities that Disney sponsors, decide if this park is your best choice.
, The address to the Magic Kingdom is located at 3111 World Dr, Lake Buena Vista, FL 32830.. The cost to park your car at the Magic Kingdom will run you about $17 for cars and upwards from there (depending on complexity of vehicle). Depending on how far into the lots it took you to get to park, you could be located in either the Aladdin, Cruella, Hook, Jafar, Mulan, Peter Pan, Rapunzel, Scar, Simba, Ursula, Woody, or Zurg parking lots that are located on campus. ,, The parking lot for the Magic Kingdom is at the Ticket and Transportation Center (nicknamed by Disney enthusiasts as the TTC). The ride is about 10 minutes(by boat) and about 5-8 minutes (by monorail).

,, You'll see Main Street USA directly in front of you.

, The Magic Kingdom is formed into about 6 lands around one central hub area/monument called Cinderella's Castle. These lands include Tomorrowland, Fantasyland, Liberty Square, Frontierland and Adventureland., The train makes one complete trip in 20 minutes, but gives you a general idea of what to expect and where to go and can pick you up and bring you elsewhere most of the time, so your feet don't walk miles around and back, many times. They have three trains that are authentic steam engines found by Disney from Mexico but were completely overhauled.
,, Main Street USA is a long walkway that contains shops and a few desert-type bakeries. There aren't any real rides or shows in this section. However, when the parade comes through in Walt Disney World, it's nice to know; the parade marches down Main Street USA on it's way to it's exit/entrance gate nearby the Railroad.

, Walt decided to pay tribute to the famous Disney park contributors to thank them for all their hard work. He gave all these contributors a decal on a window. Some of them are rather hilarious (some don't just say the name but they take a humorous approach) and others are harder to spot. See how many you can spot and try to determine which designer they belong to. In the Magic Kingdom, there's a book out there that describes who's on these windows, but it hasn't been updated recently, so there could be more.

, Although the Emporium here (just at the one corner nearest the train station) supplies some really great souvenirs, there are others here such as the Plaza Ice Cream Shop where you can pick up an ice cream that isn't served from a cart.


If you'd like, you can pick up monogrammed Mickey ears at the Chapeau, or stop by Crystal Arts, Kodak Camera Center (for camera supplies), or Disney Clothiers for even more great souvenirs. But you have to judge what you'll need from this street in terms of souvenirs.

, Although with babies you can get a ""Babies First Haircut with a certificate to remember this special moment (as Disney says, ""Magical Moment"") you yourself can get ones from here too.

, These legendary performers have straw hats, colorful striped vests, bowties, spats and taps. They sing four-part harmony for a short while and can sometime interact with guests if they aren't singing.

, Disney's Magic Kingdom provides horse-drawn trolleys, an omnibus (at times), a jitney or a horseless carriage. Sometimes their fire engine runs and takes some passengers with them. Most of them take you from the entrance near the Fire Station to the hub area located near Cinderella Castle at the center of the park.

, Although this is a place to stop and spend a few minutes, watch a few minutes of an old time movie such as Steamboat Willie which tends to never close.

, Storytellers depicts Walt as he would have looked in 1923 standing with Mickey as he was seen in the 1930s. This statue is engraved by two plaques on either side of the statue at ground level.

, Cinderella's Castle is at the hub of the park and will take you from the Hub to Fantasyland.

,, You'll find several great places such as Tony's Town Square and the Plaza Restaurant to satisfy most eating needs. For quick service, there's Casey's Corner and the Main Street Confectionary and Bakery (Bakery features Starbucks Coffee).

,, Tomorrowland contains a futuristic view of what life might be like for most Americans.

, ""Buzz Lightyear's Space Ranger Spin"" is a fun ride where you get to compete with the person sitting next to you! You shoot at the ""Z"" targets throughout the ride.

, The Carousel of Progress was once an exhibit at the 1964 World's Fair in New York, NYand was one of Walt's own ideas that he instilled in it's creators/builders.

, The Astro Orbitor will give you a ""spin"" that you will likely never forget (though this spin is perfectly safe, since you ride a ""spaceship"").

, This very slow moving ride can take a little while, but moves super slow and is nice and cool as it rides past and along the edge of some buildings. At one point, you can see inside of Space Mountain (and when the lights are turned on in Space Mountain, you can see part of it's track layout.)

,, Anyone who's driven a car can drive these things, but there is a height restriction to reach the pedal, so if you are a kid, ask your parents to help you.

, This is an interactive show that even involves the audience at certain points, and is sure to make you laugh.

, This is an attraction that is nice if you have Stitch lovers in your party, and it has multiple stages, so plan ahead to spend a few minutes here if you want to do it.

,,, Don't ride Dumbo, if the wait line is long. Dumbo is very popular with the young and young-at-heart crowd. However, due to the 2012 addition of a second Dumbo next door, that line may be shortened quite a bit, but sometimes still does grow to long lengths that are only half as long.

You may receive a pager while you wait that will let you know when it's time to ride. If you do, allow your kids to blow off steam in the play area that is located in the area where you wait.







, This ride is relatively new, and has been known to have long waits. If you want to avoid that, consider getting to the ride first thing when the park opens, and the line may not be as long.

, The Barnstormer can be found near the railroad depot for Fantasyland.

,,, The It's a Small World ride is a staple of many family's vacation plans to the Magic Kingdom.

,, It's neat to be able to see the town and areas that were once shown in the movie, up close.

,,, Not only will you learn some interesting facts about the presidency, but seeing some of these audio animatronics that look life-like of each of our last presidents is very amazing to all who visit.


Also take note of the official presidential seal in the waiting room. Don't try to climb over the railing to get close to the seal. It's closely-guarded and police will come and get you if you try to climb over the barricade and try to take a picture with it (escorting you completely out of the building).







,, ""Arrrgggh, matey! Ahoy lads!""

, It's nice and cool inside and you can take a long load off your feet for a little while. The show lasts about 10-15 minutes (depending on how long you must wait to exit standing in line).

, Jungle cruise is a cruise along the Walt-Disney World river featuring several audio animatronic animals and even some audio animatronic Native American Indians join in the ""party"". This is a good start for a cool, misty ride (especially if it's windy and rainy (though each boat is covered in a top on top of you)).

, Don't worry if you don't get to experience the thrill; it's much like Dumbo, but you fly on carpet-looking instruments.

, Not only do you have to walk up many, many stairs, but also with no elevator to take you to the top, and on top of that, there's little to see and do once you reach the top!

, Your heart will be pounding from the thrill you'll receive here, and you'll be ready for more action. Splash Mountain is good on those days when it's hot and humid, but the lines tend to be crazy long by Noon, so get here first thing if you'd like to ride.


This ride always closes down the moment any lightning or thunder is observed in this region of the state. However, they do send down ""test cars"" as a just-in-case measure, to check when the area is safe and still keeps the car motors running smoothly. You should see empty cars while this ride is underway during a thunderstorm.

Most people try to get a feel for it's size, so be one of those visitors and try it out.,, Especially in the holiday season(including different ones for Halloween and Christmas - (hence HalloWishes and Holiday Wishes), Wishes is very interesting and makes you want to feel like a kid again. Almost any place in the Magic Kingdom is a good place to watch Wishes, however, Main Street USA facing Cinderella Castle is by far the best (and most-popular) area to watch it (so be there bright and early before people catch on to your viewing spot). Try to get to your chosen viewing spot at least half an hour to an hour in advance, as viewing spots everywhere tend to fill up quickly.

, At Disney auditions, you will be asked to do an 8-count dance. Its very simple, and the purpose of it is to see how comfortable you are, so keep smiling the whole time and make it look like you know what you're doing. You will also be asked to do a charade. Example: pretend to be washing a truck. Be as animated as you can, because remember you're bringing a character to life!

,, You must wear comfortable clothes. If you have dancing shoes, wear them. Don't wear heavy makeup, because Disney wants to see your natural face, not a painting of it. Having your hair in a ponytail makes it easier, too. If you have glasses, wear contact lenses.

, In your head-shot, wear simple makeup and smile. Make sure the lighting is just right and there isn't anything going on in the background of your photo.

, When they ask what your name is, just say your name. Don't say which Disney princess you wish to play, since it's possible you could play several different characters.

, It is typical for a prospective princess to audition multiple times before being hired. However, Disney does not allow more than one audition every six months.

Take lots of photographs and bring them home as souvenirs.",How to Visit Walt Disney World," As one of the largest and most popular theme parks in the United States, Disney World is likely going to be crowded no matter what time of year you go. If you are trying to avoid crowds and you do not have to work around your children’s school schedule, you may want to avoid visiting Disney World on school or national holidays. This will allow you to avoid crowds of families traveling to the park for the same school holidays and breaks.If you have to factor in your children’s school schedule, you may want to pick dates in the fall, winter, or spring months, as the park can be crowded and hot during the summer months.
You can also use Disney World’s crowd calendar tool to check the best times to visit the park.Even if you end up with dates that may be on busy or crowded days, if you plan other factors of your trip correctly, you can still avoid long waits for attractions and save money on your trip by taking a few preparatory steps.;
, You can check the Disney World event program online to look up the special events and attractions going on for that year or season. Quite often, new attractions and rides are being introduced to the public, and your family may be interested in visiting the park for these attractions.The biggest seasonal events at Disney World occur in the fall and at Christmas, so you may decide to visit the park for these special events. In September, the park hosts the Food & Wine Festival at Epcot and in October, the park holds a Halloween Party in the Magic Kingdom.
In November and December, the park holds Mickey’s Very Merry Christmas Party and so, going during Christmas can be a good time to visit, as the weather is mild, the crowds can be lighter, and the park is lit up with lights and other special attractions.

, Sit down with your family or your travel companions and look over the list of attractions at Walt Disney World that will be operating during the dates you picked. Discuss and create a list of your top, must see attractions. Use this list as your day-to-day itinerary. Some of the major attractions at Disney World include:Four theme parks: Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Animal Kingdom, and Disney’s Hollywood Studios (formerly Disney-MGM Studios)
Two water parks: Blizzard Beach and Typhoon Lagoon
Five golf courses
Two mini-golf courses
Two dinner shows
Boardwalk entertainment district
DisneyQuest “virtual theme park”
Disney Springs shopping and dining district
A completely sortable list of the attractions at Disney World can be found on the Walt Disney World interactive website.

, Due to the scale of Disney World, you should try to plan for at least five to seven full days at the park. This may mean that you set aside one to two days for travel time to and from Orlando, for a total stay of seven to ten days.Five full days will give you enough time to visit all four theme parks and experience many of the attractions, shows, and parades. If you want to have a more leisurely time to experience the park or try some of the extra activities, like the water parks or golfing, you may opt for seven full days at the park.
Keep in mind Disney has made it more cost efficient to do longer trips, as seven day tickets do not cost much more than four day tickets. If possible, you should try to commit at least five days at the park to get the full experience.

, Once you determine your top must see attractions, your travel dates, and the duration of your visit, you should create a day to day itinerary. This way, you can be sure to fit in everything you would like to see and stay organized once you get to the park.You may decide to spend at least one full day at each theme park, with breaks at specific restaurants for lunch in each of the parks. You may also factor in a specific show at the park that you would like to see or a parade. You should also account for time spent at other attractions, like the water park or the mini-golf course.
Certain restaurants at each of the park require reservations, and because of their heavier guest population, must be booked at least six to eight months before your trip.Look at a dining guide for the park and add several dining options to your itinerary. Disney also offers a Dining Plan as an add on, where you pay for access to dining spots in the park.You may decide to save money by bringing your own snacks and preparing your own meals to bring into the park. Although expensive, the dining at Disney World is known to be eclectic and worth trying, so you may decide to treat yourself to dining in the park one or two days during your visit, and brown bagging the other meals the other days.

, Transportation and accommodations can be one of the more expensive aspects of your visit to Disney World, especially if you are traveling far from home. You may want to consider your total budget for the trip and then break it down based on your planned budget for your transportation and your accommodations. This way, you will be able to stay within your budget and avoid overspending.You may also want to factor in how many people are going with you on your visit. If you are traveling with more than four people total, you may need to budget for two rooms or a suite that can fit four or more people. Disney World resorts do not allow four or more people in a single room, unless you are traveling with children under the age of three.
If you have a larger travel party, you may need to plan for cheaper transportation, like driving rather than flying. You should also consider a travel package through Disney World resorts to save money, especially if you are traveling with a large group.

, If you are looking to save money and driving to Orlando is feasible from your home base, you may go for the road trip option. This is a good option for a large travel party and if the available flights for your travel dates are expensive. Having a car to get around Orlando is also ideal, as it is not a great city for walking or public transit.The driving option is good if you are planning to stay at an off-site, budget hotel, as you can then drive to and from the park every day at your own designated times. Paying for parking can be pricy, but it is likely more budget friendly than splurging for plane tickets for the entire family.
You should also budget in the cost of gas to drive to Orlando and back. If you live in the Mountain or Pacific time zones, keep in mind you are closer to Disneyland than Disney World.

, If you would prefer to fly to Orlando, you may consider booking a flight to Orlando online or through a travel agent. You may look for cheaper flights based on your travel dates and then stay off site at a hotel close to Disney World. You should keep an eye on flight prices for your travel dates and book them in advance to get the best rates.Another option is to book a flight package through Disney Resorts, where you get your flights and accommodations together. You should consult with a travel agent who specializes in Disney World travel, as these experts will likely be able to get you the best rates., Each Disney resort is unique and offers a range of accommodation options. If you are planning to splurge a little for your visit, you may consider staying in an official Disney resort to make your stay that much more luxurious. Staying at a Disney resort gets you free transportation from the airport to the resort (via the Disney Magical Express line) as well as access to Disney buses, boats, and park monorails.Many Disney resorts also offer larger pools and other recreational options that are family oriented. You can find more information on each Disney resort on the Disney World website.
If you decide to stay at a Disney resort, you should look at discount options on the Disney website or speak to a travel agent that specializes in Disney vacations about discounts for onsite accommodations.

, If you are traveling to Disney World on a budget, you may decide to stay at an off-site hotel or resort. Larger parties of four to five people tend to go for off-property resorts, which are often located very close to Disney World. These resorts tend to feel more high end and less motel-like, with amenities for larger parties. Talk to a travel agent about off-property resort options.You can also choose a quality off-site hotel that is close to Disney World. It’s best to have a car or rent a car if you go for this option, as you will need to get to and from the park on your own.
You can check rates online and use websites that allow you to bid on rooms at hotels close to Disney World for your travel dates., Avoid paying high fees for tickets by buying your park passes in advance. You can use the Disney World website to check out the prices and select passes for the theme parks you are planning to visit. Disney ticket prices drop with every extra day to your visit you add, so try to buy all your passes at once.Passes can be very expensive when purchased through Disney’s website, so you may want to consider buying your passes from an authorized third party seller. You can do this through a third party seller like Undercover Tourist. You can also look for discounts through your local auto club(Triple A has discounts on these park tickets when you have an account with them), your student union, your human resources office at work, or through veteran affairs if you are in the military.
Do not buy passes on sites like Craigslist, eBay, or other unauthorized online ticket brokers. You cannot use someone else’s unused Disney tickets, as Disney will not accept tickets that are registered under someone else’s name.

, You cannot take coolers into the parks but you can take backpacks and purses. Load up your bag with supplies like sunscreen, toiletries, band aids, refillable water bottles, and snacks. Food and supplies in the park are often expensive so avoid spending extra money on items you can bring with you.


If you are a large party, you should each have a bag loaded with basic supplies, including non-perishable snacks and a refillable water bottle for every member who will be visiting the park that day. This will ensure that everyone in your party is prepared for a day of walking around outside and enjoying the park.
A backpack is also useful for any leftovers you may have if you do decide to eat at a dining spot in the park. This way, you can snack on the leftovers later in the day.

, Beat the crowds by arriving at the park right at opening time. The beginning of the day is often less crowded and cooler than the afternoon, and this way, you can take advantage of all the park has to offer. This will also allow you to take a break in the middle of the day, when the crowds and the heat are often at their worst, and then return to the park in the evening. Most of the theme parks open at 9 am and have Extra Magic hours, where they stay open later in the evening as well.Getting to the park early can also help you get a better parking spot at your chosen theme park. Once you pay for parking for that day, you will be able to reuse that day to enter any other Disney World theme park at no additional charge for the day.

, One of the biggest hurdles during a visit to Disney World is the long lines for attractions and rides. You can download MyDisneyExperience or theLines app to determine the wait time for each ride or attraction while you are at the park. You can then plan your visit around line times and avoid standing in long lines, which will eat up your chance to try other things at the park.


The app works for iPhone, Android, and other smartphones.

, Preserve your Disney World experience by taking lots of photographs of the attractions, the shows, the rides, and of you posing with your favorite Disney characters. You can then save money by framing these photos and keeping them as souvenirs of your trip.There are photographers hired by Disney to help you capture your special moments at the park for which they can stick it on a card and you can print them out at home (or for an additional charge, you can have them printed out at the park). Make sure you are aware of the price of the photographs before you get have them printed.

However, if you don't plan to visit both parks, there are also options for just single-day visits. You can buy Disneyland tickets from their official site at https://disneyland.disney.go.com/tickets/.
, Hotel accommodations for onsite hotels (such as the historic Disneyland Hotel, Disney's Grand Californian Hotel & Spa and the Disney's Paradise Pier Hotel) can be made on Disney's Disneyland website when you sign in. Any offsite accommodation bookings will need to be made separately, and there are many travel websites out there offering deals on air travel, car rental, and hotel stays., There are videos from the point of view of the rider available online for almost all Disney rides. Check YouTube and other similar resources. You won't find quite the same video resources for hotels and all Downtown Disney attractions, but you can find descriptions and photographs., Although this will vary by park (and whether or not there's a Early Admission option), the parks are generally open from 9AM to 10PM Pacific Time. However, some park events will force it to close much earlier or later than that on select nights.

Make sure you plan enough time to see it all. Your exact trip will vary depending on your goals and the ages/needs of those traveling with you. However, planning enough time for everything is crucial, if you want to see it all.
If possible, schedule at least one night at each park so that you can experience both of Disneyland's nighttime shows: ""Wonderful World of Color"" at the Disney California Adventure park and ""Remember...Dreams Come True Fireworks Spectacular"" at Disneyland. If the nighttime fireworks aren't being shown, there are still some good light parades twice per night; these run between Fantasyland and a location near the Firehouse on Main Street, USA near the park entrance. Park maps can be found in their entirety at https://disneyland.disney.go.com/maps/.

, Besides your tickets, you'll need some money. Depending on the weather, you may want sunglasses, a hat, and sunscreen, or perhaps a light rain poncho. Be sure that your belongings can be tucked away on rides., Anaheim is generally warm, but can have most misty-foggy summer mornings. Rain is rare but can be intense when it comes., If you are staying at an offsite hotel in Anaheim, there is the Anaheim Resort Transportation that is offered from many of hotel chains that is offered for more than half off the cost of parking near Disneyland. However, if you are coming from elsewhere or just plan on parking with your own car, Disneyland has their own parking structure just to the west of the Disneyland Resort and to the West of Downtown Disney. The address to the parking structure is 1313 S Disneyland Dr, Anaheim, CA 92802.The cost to park your car at this park is about $17, and even more for different types of vehicles., The tram will take you from the west side (parking lot entrance/exit) to the east entrance just before the bag check area nearest the walkway that connects the two parks.

However, if you'd like to walk to the park, you can take a walking path through Downtown Disney that will lead to this same entrance, or to the monorail which you can take you and your fellow guests from Downtown Disney into the park (with at least a valid park ticket (for first time entry) and ticket with hand stamp (for re-entry if you choose to leave and come-back)).

, Some rides offer FastPasses (which at Disneyland still come in the form of a paper ticket), but others don't, so plan and prioritize accordingly. Some attractions will be more swamped than others, so if you really want to ride a crowded one that doesn't offer a FastPass, head there right away to beat the crowd and make sure you get in, or aim for a less busy time.

Some rides in Disneyland come with warnings against riding them if you are pregnant or have health problems, but most are fairly safe and kid-friendly. At Disney California Adventure, however, attractions tend to be faster paced and induce more motion sickness. Not all rides there are appropriate for young children.

, At intervals throughout the day, you may want to take a break from lining up and riding the fast rides. Some of this downtime can be spent at some of the entertainment options around the parks.You can also enjoy the dining options, as well as shopping locations.If you are staying on site at a Disneyland hotel, they can deliver your purchases to you at the hotel, later on.

, Such attractions here include Sleeping Beauty Castle, the Enchanted Tiki Room (with it's incomparable Dole Whip stand) and Dumbo the Flying Elephant, Splash Mountain, Space Mountain, Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, Pirates of the Caribbean (with it's triple flumes that the Florida attraction can't match) and other special effects) and the Haunted Mansion attractions among the many other rides here that almost line up to those found in Disney's Magic Kingdom in Florida., This park tends to be forgotten until you have seen some of the attractions they offer here. If you've ever visited the parks in Florida and see that there's a wealth of rides that aren't offered in Disneyland, chances are a similar or comparable ride will be offered at Disney's California Adventure park here. In Disney's California Adventure park, you'll find rides such as California Screamin as well as MIckey's Fun Wheel (ferris wheel with some twists that make it unique), Radiator Springs Racers, Toy Story Midway Mania, Turtle Talk with Crush, Soarin Aroun the World and Muppet Vision 3D among the many excellent attractions here and even some unique rides near Paradise Pier that not even any other park would even plan to offer but show's the values of this beautiful state of California., This area is outside the Disneyland parks and doesn't require a ticket for entry. It offers a wealth of shops, as well as an AMC movie theatre and restaurants, including the popular wildlife-themed Rainforest Café. There are also lots of souvenir shops."

",How to Visit Disneyland with Kids," Although any days of the year should work, most people travel to Disneyland during the summer.;
, Not all tastes will be enjoyed by all. Whether it be the whimsical world of Disneyland park, or the wilder side known as Disneyland's California Adventure park, there's something for every age group.

, Whether it's the ""it's a small world"" ride, the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, the Haunted Mansion or whatever, find out a little about each of the rides existing there and explain what each ride will do.


Have several meetings with each family member. Explain rides that may be able to be tailored to their age group. Keep a list of what you expect to see written down along with their respective ""land"" they are featured in available nearby.

, Get to know the ride and what your kids could expect to see. Ask yourself the following questions about the POV ride experience: Is the ride an indoor ride, or will it go outdoors? Does the ride vehicle travel fast or does it travel rather slow?


If you're not into rides, this step might not be for you. Not many character greetings on the walkway paths are ever taped for YouTube itself.

, Whether it's from a food vendor or it's a piece of clothing or other piece of merchandise, you'll need to know exactly what your kids might be enticed into asking you to purchase. While some age kids are free with a paying adult, some are a smaller additional charge. Know these things before you leave, and potentially even purchase your tickets or ticket package. (Plan this part at least one month before your intended arrival in the Anaheim, California area.)

, Whether it's by car, bus, airplane, train or if you are only a few blocks away (by walking), it's impossible not to be able to arrive in the area of Disneyland.

, Have them either hitch a ride in a stroller or have them walk (if they are over the age of completely being immobilized by the stroller) through the gate with their ticket.


Don't give your kids any water or juice jugs as you go through security, but as soon as you get through the turnstiles, it's okay to give them the liquid to drink. Make things easier on the checkpoint person, so they don't have to glance at the kid in an ""awkward"" way.

, You'll find these just beyond the turnstile gates. If you don't speak much English, recognize that some of these maps come with additional language park map copies.

, While most people head right for Fantasyland and it's great classic rides (Dumbo and it's a small world), you might want to work the opposite way from Sleeping Beauty Castle starting at Adventureland and working backwards and around the opposite way. There are some other really great rides that exist from Adventureland going around to Tomorrowland.

, Make a pass into and out of Toontown USA and eventually into and through Sleeping Beauty Castle.

Recognize that some of the Walt Disney World resorts (including the Boardwalk, Contemporary and Grand Floridian resorts) get all decked out in holiday motif that they have a large gingerbread house on display in their atrium near their front entrance ways.
Get used to the holiday performances of the Dapper Dans orchestra. This group may sing and perform comedy during the rest of the day, but during Christmas, you'll get tunes inspired by the season in what appears to be spontaneous (but tends to not be so spontaneous) times. Look for this show at least 9 times a day and most often this will be before 2pm along the boundaries of Main Street USA.
If you can catch a performance of the Holly Jolly Trolley Show, watch it. Most people might say it's cheesy, but when the tunes are holiday-based, your opinions definitely matter.
Watch the parade called ""Mickey's Once Upon a Christmastime. This choreographed parade will definitely get you set into the holiday spirit and ready to end your day. Not only will the parade astound you, but it's additional falling snow (caused by a soap-bubble solution) and additional Christmas lights along most of the buildings, will definitely set you all aglow and ready for the parade. With show times twice per day and once per party night(separate ticket event as you'll read later), this will surely astound most guests who come to visit it.

Visit with Santa Claus Goofy within the confines of Magic Kingdom's Main Street USA. Go right towards Santa Goofy as the park gates open at 10am or right before park guests are escorted out at 5pm for the shortest wait times.
Pass on the A Totally Tomorrowland Christmas stag show near Rocket tower Plaza in/near Tomorrowland. Not only does it have no official seating, but it's also not shown for a very long time, with performances every day between December 21st and December 31st (and at all separately-ticketed Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party).
Look for Santas at some of the country building attractions near World Showcase in Epcot to entertain guests with Christmas shows after about 11:30am and dusk(during the separately-ticketed Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party). Santas from their respective country are on hand to speak to guests about their traditions in their country (in the Holidays Around the World Storytellers attractions) in the English language. (Catch these Santas at Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Morocco, Norway, inside the American Adventure and United Kingdom pavilion areas.)
Catch the Candlelight Processional in Epcot, even if you aren't a religious person. It's beautiful and inspiring, though the tale it tells is about the story of the birth of Jesus with a 50 piece orchestra to go along with it. It is shown several times every evening (though one of it's times is during each of it's parties.
Look for Santa and Mrs. Claus intermittently in the American Adventure in Epcot's World Showcase pavilion between November 29th and December 24th from 11am to park closing time.

Catch the Voices of Liberty singing Christmas carols with their various performances for 20 minutes each day inside the lobby of the American Adventure pavilion (the times for New Years Eve differ so check your Times Guide accordingly).


Get involved with the performance of the Citizens of Hollywood skit over at the Disney Studios. This improvisational skit will sometimes base it off of crowd answers. If they ask for volunteers, make yourself look like you'd like to be chosen; make eye contact and wear something colorful, stand in front of the crowd and smile. Look for this group along Sunset Boulevard (often in front of the Beverly Sunset Theater) and Hollywood Boulevard.
Ask a Disney Employee inside the Disney Studios when you enter when and where a showtime for The Comedy Warehouse Holiday Special will be held. It doesn't appear too often, but is definitely worth seeing at least once in your life. Songs based off of completely improvisational people's few questions. Most often times it's at the Premier Theater along the Streets of America, but check with employees when and where the showing will be shown. as times and dates of availability vary.
Watch the 1983 theatrical holiday film called ""Mickey's Christmas Carol"" from inside the ABC Sound Studio at the Disney Studios. Take a break and watch it, if you feel you need to take a break during the day.
Watch the Mulch, Sweat and Shears show that has holiday performance from mid November through December. Most often times, this group will choose a female from the audience to join them in their musical skit.
Watch Mickey's Jingle Jungle Parade in Disney's Animal Kingdom. This parade, besides the decorations inside the park is the only real holiday festivity to check out that is Disney parks inspired inside this park (due to the animal's issues with other nighttime festivities). Holiday lyrics of a now-former Disney's Animal Kingdom parade adorn all viewers. If you'd like to be selected to ride in a rickshaw, there are even people who are able to sit in these spots. This parade is shown twice per day (to and from it's African village in the Africa section of the park).;
, If you plan late, the quality of your Disney vacation is on the line. Procrastination is not the best way to go. If you book the night before, you could be sleeping in the hotel's basement!


The earlier in the Christmas season you plan for, the better the crowds will be once you arrive during the season. Disney World seems to set up their Christmas activities starting around November 8and continuing through Christmas and New Years.

, If unwrapping presents on that cold Christmas morning or other Christmas traditions are that important to you, you can always plan around those traditions! Don't go changing any of your other Christmas activities around if you really don't have to.

, Much like during Disney World's summer peak season, Christmas is the second peak season during the year. Many people visit the Disney parks during Christmas. If you get a Fast Pass, you will sail through the lines with ease

, With the holiday coming and goings, you will need to firm up all your plans for the holidays.

, There are several rides and attractions that change their attraction for the Christmas season. Some of them include The Haunted Mansion, It's a Small World, and several other decorations and parades all over most of the parks.There's even a place in Disney's MGM Studio's that has it's own separate Christmas themed area that's been there for close to 3 decades.


As of 2013, even the Jungle Cruise ""dresses up"" for the occasion. They become the ""Jingle Cruise"" and even their boat names become names of the famous Christmas ""stars"".

, This special ticket isn't included in the cost of your park ticket and must be purchased separately. You can purchase these at the Walt Disney World Ticketing and Guest Services locations, over the phone (at 407-939-5277) or from Disney's Website (tickets can be mailed to you, printed out on a printer or can be picked up later at the Magic Kingdom Will Call window.) They can also be mailed to you for a separate fee.


Recognize that this special party doesn't happen every day of the season, though there are a great majority of days that are generally planned each year for the party, throughout November and December and even into the first few days of January.

, For those guests, expect to see a few Disney employees holding up a sign with letters that spell out ""See Ya"" (or See Ya Soon) on items that look like candy corn. All other non-ticketed park guests will be escorted out of the park and a second trip around the park by a Disney employee will be made looking for those trying to escape not paying for the service 15 minutes later., Each individual park has it's own services that it gives guests after dusk.


Magic Kingdom

Look for a stage show called Celebrate the Season in front of Cinderella Castle at Magic Kingdom. This 20 minute show, shown 4-5 times a day is filled with lots of holiday music and serenading to get the holiday spirit back into the guest.
Watch Cinderella Castle get lit up in it's holiday icicles every night of the party in an event the Disney Parks call Cinderella's Holiday Wish. Plan to be in the viewing area in front of Cinderella Castle at least 15 minutes before viewing time one time per night (viewing time generally will be about 6:15, though this can change should storms be impacting the area).
Watch the Holiday Wishes show from Main Street USA. Although all the Wishes shows definitely astounds it's guests for it's 12 minute performance, this Holiday Wishes show will definitely top the cake (almost literally, but you'll have to see this for yourself to understand what this literal definition means).


Epcot

Catch the Candlelight Processional in Epcot, even if you aren't a religious person. It's beautiful and inspiring, though the tale it tells is about the story of the birth of Jesus with a 50 piece orchestra to go along with it.
Get the party started with watching the nighttime fireworks called Illuminations:Reflections of Earth with an additional Christmas/holiday addendum performance narrated by Walter Cronkite and featuring the song Let There Be Peace on Earth. Catch this at about 8:45pm(though the fireworks don't generally start until 9pm). Try to catch this in World Showcase Plaza; on top of being the closest exit point out for the hordes of people who will try to trample you down, it's the closest and easiest to see vantage point to see the show.


Disney Studios

Catch the Osbourne Family's Spectacle of Dancing Lights at least one time in your life. Typically along both the New York Street and San Francisco Street and even some in the plaza in front of the Lights, Motors, Action attraction, a canopy of lights overhead of guests are synchronized to the music. Between the lights on the sides of the buildings along with the canopy of lights and a lot more Christmastime favorite sets of lights, this spectacle features over 5 million LED lights which had previously been created by the parents of Jennings Osborne, but were legally asked not be hung there in the 1980s. Only those who've seen this spectacle live, know just how astounding this display of lights really are. The lights get turned on at about 6pm, but arrive a half hour early for the best entry time.

",How to Visit Epcot," Discuss some of your other options that exist for the other nearby Walt Disney World parks or local attractions in the area. With other major possibilities being the Magic Kingdom, the Disney (Hollywood/MGM) Studios, and Disney's Animal Kingdom and the 2 of Disney-owned water parks (and few other non-Disney operated water parks including Typhoon Lagoon and Blizzard Beach) and other activities that Disney sponsors, decide if Epcot is your best choice.;
, If you want thrill rides, the Magic Kingdom and the Disney Hollywood Studios have a handful of them, but not many thrill rides exist at Epcot. If you want to go for information with not much thrill, head to Epcot.

, Alternatively, you could take the monorail from your hotel or the Ticket and Transportation Center (TTC) to the Epcot station. The address to Epcot is located at 1200 Epcot Resort Blvd, Lake Buena Vista, FL 32830 . The cost to park your car at the Magic Kingdom will run you about $17 for cars and upwards from there (depending on complexity of vehicle).Dependent on the row, you could be parked in one of 7 areas of the parking lot system at Epcot. These areas include the Journey , Discover, Amaze, Create, Imagine, Explore or Wonders lotYou can alternatively take a Disney's Magical Express (Disney-operated bus that is free to guests staying on Disney property) from Orlando International Airport to this park.
If you are staying at one of the hotels that has the monorail stopping at their resort (including Disney's Contemporary Resort, Grand Floridian Resort or Polynesian resort), you can take the monorail to this area. There is no cost to ride the monorail at any time in your vacation.

,, At the entrance you'll find one of 2 racks holding an English version of the map, along with maps of other subsequent languages. The languages they have include Spanish, French, German, Chinese, Italian). It's two lands are essentially called Future World and World Showcase.



Future World is composed of several rides and attractions that are primarily an informational-only experience.

World Showcase features some informative information about the cultures of countries worldwide.

, Visit Test Track as the first thing you do when you arrive. Besides being the attraction the farthest back on the one side, this one gets very crowded well before noon on most weekdays and weekends. Ever wanted to experience what it's like to test a car during it's production? This attraction is where to try it out and see what it's like.

, Try out the Mission:Space exhibit if you have ever wanted to know how it feels to become an astronaut who journeys into space. It is located one pavilion to the north of Test Track, and much like Test Track, does tend to be crowded at times.

, Tour the Ellen's Energy Adventures building. Do this if you'd like to learn about the history of the energy sources you very commonly use in today's world.

, If you can't seem to find the geodesic dome, ask one of the Disney's Cast Members for assistance, however finding it shouldn't be hard as it's the biggest (and iconic) theme building there is on the Epcot property. Unless you've been there before, most people don't know that the glass golf-ball shaped building actually has a ride inside it! This ride presents an informative view of the history of telecommunications.

, Although this exhibit changed from being informative to a more comical take on the ocean floor, it has actually gotten an upgrade with its 2006 upgrade. It now contains a very fun attraction that kids love to come back and try time and time again to ride. Whether it's the Turtle Talk with Crush exhibit or the Nemo (from Finding Nemo movie) ride, they will both take you on a journey to see aquatic wildlife to see and explain those viewpoints of the marine wildlife here.

, Although it is one of this pavilion's most-often visited attraction in the park (Soarin), it also has some information booths and another ride (called Living with the Land). There are a few tours that step through this pavilion(which might be rather cheap but worth the money tour called Behind the Seeds), and you can even eat some of the crops that are forested here, inside this pavilion's one restaurant.

, However, everything that this building was once known for, has been removed (including the DNA helix that once stood in front of the building). If you end up walking into a building that has no people inside it and it has a yellow domed roof, chances are that you've arrived into the former Wonders of Life pavilion., It's actually rather comical and definitely a relief in the hot and humid Florida heat to ride this ride.


Look for the Upside-Down House here. This will keep your kids' minds from going blank and keep asking you ""How did they do that"" no matter how many times you'll ride it. Your mind will be amazed at what your eyes are turning around and showing you what it in-turn interprets.

, And what's really interesting about this exhibit/attraction, is that they have two entrances from both the East and West sides of Future World.

, It's breathtaking looking at Bay Lake, it's boats that depart and arrive from Epcot. It's so peaceful, that sometimes doves and seagulls can be seen and heard in the area. There are benches near the monorail track before in the center area before crossing the bridge to World Showcase, but it's more interesting and more invigorating when you actually partake to walk into the area called World Showcase.

, Ride the Grand Fiesta Tour or eat at the restaurant that overlooks the beginning portion of the ride's area out the back of the restaurant. Take in a few of it's shopping possibilities here. What's even better is if you are able to get a seat inside the building which overlooks the entryway for the remainder of the shopping portion of the pavilion. The building itself will sometimes even make people stop and think: ""Am I really in America now?""

, However, be careful; the first several days the attraction was open they experienced several evacuations (as per several videos on YouTube already) and your ride could be a thud as well. It opened on June 22, 2016. If you choose not to ride, there is at least one shopping location and several restaurants associated to the Norwegian pavilion.



Maelstrom closed in 2014 and a complete rebuild opened in 2016. What makes this experience even more fun, is that they also have other Norwegian-inspired things that show you the other side of this cold country called Norway.
Be careful of Akershus Royal Banquet Hall. On top of dining, this is also a very popular place to meetup with a few of your Disney royalty character friends.

, Eat Chinese food and drink green tea from a Chinese tea garden (called Joy of Tea and Lotus Blossom Café) here. However, no shopping locations exist in the Chinese pavilions.

, Although The Outpost was never fully finished , a portion of that land still exists inside Epcot. You'll find The Outpost situated conveniently between the China and Germany pavilions in the World Showcase side of the park. It contains mostly shopping locations (such as Bead Outpost) but there's also Village Traders nearby in the same area. If you want refreshments, they sell Coca Cola products in this area, but you'll have to ask to receive what product you want.

, Visit the Germany pavilions, if you'd like to learn a little more about the food and culture of Germany. Or take a breather near the fountain just outside the ""town"" square which was featured on the Florida episodes of Full House in 1994 when Bob Saget (stage named Danny) tried to propose to Gail Edwards (stage named Vicky) but got interrupted by a German Lederhosen band! There are several shopping locations that sell German trinkets as well as beer and wine here (one of the few places on Disney property that does so, so savor the moment if you choose to buy some.)

, Learn a little something about Italy and their rich culture in the Italian exhibit with their food and shopping options. With many Italian pizzerias and Italian cuisine here, there's no way you can leave empty-stomached.

, If you want, there's a cool stage act (that goes by the same name as the pavilion itself) which can surely take the heat off tired feed on a hot summer day. If stage plays aren't your ""thing"", the Voices of Liberty perform inside the entrance several times a day, or you can eat at the Liberty Inn or Fife and Drum Tavern or shop at a trinket shop called Heritage Manor Gifts or at a bookseller called My Heritage Books. Take a look at some of the painted portraits on the walls inside the building for the full experience of what United States really is; you might even see something you might not even be expecting in them.

, With their Japanese inspired dancers (in Jeweled Dragon Acrobats and Matsuriza) on the outside ring that occasionally perform, these performances are very inspiring. However, watch out for these times on your times guides, as this doesn't happen all that often every day. You can either eat fish dishes at Teppan Edo or eat at Tokyo Dining. For those with shopping on their minds, they have gift shops here too called Good Fortune Gifts as well as the House of Good Fortune. If grilled dishes and other Japanese-inspired dishes more casually suit your taste buds, try out either Kabuki Café or Katsura Grill in and around Japan's pavilions.

, Let Morocco rule out when you need to learn a little about African culture. There are a few shopping opportunities here that present the Moroccan culture to the everyday person.As far as Moroccan shopping prevails here, they mostly sell leather goods including pocketbooks (at a higher price) as well as brass trinkets. Take a look at the décor around these shops and areas; they will remind you of Moroccan architecture and almost become Aladdin-like.

, Try out France's 3D movie available called Impressions de France,(interpreted into English as Impressions of France). From a shopping and dining presence, there are a few shopping and dining establishments here but few are well-known at this time.

, Visit an English bar and/or pub in this area with Rose and Crown Dining Room&Pub. Listen to some music from a British group who call themselves the ""British Revolution"" who perform nearby (which is no longer a group who look like those from ""The Beatles""). Walk down the fake Abbey Road strip as you enter the area or shop around this area (including into shops called Crown and Crest as well as Tea Cady or Sportsman's Shoppe) to get a rich feel for the culture of England. If you'd like, you can even head into ""Queens Table"" (shopping), if all these other choices aren't quite enough. Make a quick photograph moment in a former British payphone booth that used to have a working payphone (but no longer does).

, It may be one of the last places you'd think to be able to keep yourself cool, but it surely will. If 3D movies aren't your thing, you can shop at Northwest Mercantile (a Canadian-like) gift shop or Trading Post or you can eat at the rather small steakhouse onsite.


The amount of work the designers put into this land here is really spectacular. Whether it's the Canadian house of parliament or it's the totem poles, design here is very immense and spectacular. If they are performing, there may even be a band at the entrance performing on bagpipes, but you'll have to ask around to see what's going on when you are there to ensure that you won't miss them; it is all just ""that good"".

, With a few stops inside World Showcase along with the few stops outside the park at a few of their resorts and even one close to Disney's Hollywood Studios around the corner, the boats are actually becoming a valuable option to choose to use when coming to the park, or for those who wish to transfer between parks midday if they don't wish to head into World Showcase for very long. There are two docks near the center of the entrance near the bridge near the monorail loop as well as near the Morocco and Germany pavilions, getting around World Showcase by way of water is actually rather sweet. However, in preparation for all nightly activities to come out, setup and run these boats don't run the entire day long., Their show better known just as Illuminations"" is grandiose in action and features many synchronously-timed fireworks and laser beams that shoot high into the sky. It's shown on most nights at around 9 PM, and is rarely cancelled due to rain or other inclement weather. They even have some seasonal variations including a Christmas and New Years Eve and Independence Day special Illuminations.

, This band plays on the most unlikely of instruments including garbage cans, garbage can lids and other clanging instruments.,,"

With the other major possibilities being the Disneyland, and Downtown Disney (though no real rides exist in Downtown Disney) and the wealth of other parks within the vicinity include Universal Studios of Hollywood and Six Flags Magic Mountain, the Southern California landscape isn't without its wealth of rides.;
, Disneyland and Disney's California Adventure park have their drawbacks. One of these drawbacks is that in order to visit, you'll either have to park in the Mickey and Friends parking structure, or ride the ART(Anaheim Resort Transit) tram to the park. Although the address to the parking structure is 1313 S Disneyland Dr, Anaheim, CA 92802. The cost to park your car at this park will run you about $17 for cars and upwards from there (depending on complexity of vehicle).


Due to the cost, it's often advised to ride the ART tram/trolley to get to the park, though if you are coming from out of the Anaheim area, you may end up taking a car and parking in the parking lot nearby these Disneyland parks.

,,,, This park is formed into 8 lands without a central hub area. These lands include Buena Vista Street, Hollywood Land, a bug's land, Cars Land, Pacific Wharf, Paradise Pier, Grizzly Peak and Condor Flats..

, The first thing you'll notice is Buena Vista Street. Although Buena Vista Street once held a few famous attractions that could later have became the center piece by some, it has few to no rides today, and truly exists as the true dining place in the park.

, This waterfall is a famous spot used for picture taking, though this isn't the most famous exhibit in the park.

, Don't get too enthused at waiting around for a long period of time, as everybody needs to take turns here.

, If you don't mind motion simulators, you'll fair very well here. The building looks like an oversized orange-colored airplane hangar.

,,, This attraction features a normal ride for those daring small princesses wishing to fulfill a few wishes.

, These seats are available right across from the Little Mermaid ride. They are formed in layers with deep (long) steps. This spot is also a famous spot to check out the prime candidate of the viewpoint of Paradise Pier (making it a famous picture-taking spot!).

, Although a few rides in Disneyland and Walt Disney World can match that of the experience on Golden Zephyr, not many are comparable. You'll need to be able to walk up a short flight of stairs, but once up the stairs, you'll (as Disney calls it) rocket around a central pivot point in a spaceship type of seat without even lifting a finger or touching a button.

,, It is considered to be a ""training roller coaster"" for those who haven't ridden a roller coaster"" yet and would like to experience what it's like.

, The ride entrance is nearby, but isn't right there when you see the track.

,, This roller coaster is the fastest roller coaster throughout all the Disney Parks, and is also one of the newest coasters within the Disney Parks system worldwide. So hang on tight!

, And with the special effect of 3D and sometimes 4D effects, there's no reason no one could come out of this place unhappy.

,, It will definitely remind you of a Boardwalk styled bridge on or near the Pacific Ocean.

, Although the restaurant has changed hands from Ariel's Grotto to another place, it still is a very popular restaurant at this theme park.

, Hollywood Land can't be accessed from any other area but the hub area of the park.

,


Look for the Turtle Talk with Crush showing. If you want to see this classic show where Crush interacts with kids and tries to answer some kids' questions, this is sure to please.






Crush sometimes looks around for the children's parents, so be on the lookout, if you hear your child scream, giggle or look back to see where his/her parents are in the audience (yes, the spotlight turns to you too).



, It's a very interesting movie that is sure to please any Muppet fan in all of it's audiences. Any and all kids will surely get a kick out of seeing their favorite Muppet Show character here. If you watch closely, you might even see some real characters appearing before your very eyes.

, If you are a fan of Monsters, Inc, you're sure to relive the story of Monsters Inc on this ride.

,,, if Muppet Vision 3D didn't overdo your adventure. If you don't get very scared too easily, watch a show of it here, and you'll soon be seeing the life of a bug through the eyes of the bug.

,

This area includes a bumper-cars styled ride (Tuck and Roll's Drive Em Buggies),







Francis Ladybug Boogie:







Flik's Flyers:







Heimlich's Chew Chew Train:






Also, look out for Princess Dot Puddle Park. This area is an awesome way to get wet as you or your kids tromp through the watery area.







, Although similar to some mild scrambler rides, this one is surely to impress almost everyone who arrives on it.

, Based on the action of Test Track at the Walt Disney World Disney park Epcot, you will surely not be sorry that you rode it.

, If you stand just right, everyone along the route can get wet, and everyone has a blast. Whatever you decide to take in in this park, do not miss this parade if you are in the park on a hot summer day - make it a plan to be along the parade route and have some relaxing fun, all while getting cooled off in turn.


If you see a person carrying a water thrower and you see them looking at you, you can tell them to spray elsewhere, or if you choose to want to get sprayed but fear them spraying at a particular area mention where else you'd like to spray (such as at your arms, hands, chin or neck but you shouldn't need to tell them why unless they look at you funny and request more information.)
Be prepared to be on the benches on the side of the walking path near the bridge to Pacific Wharf up to two hours before the parade passes through the area, as spots on benches fill up fast!

, This wonderful watery nighttime spectacular features some dazzling colors, and especially being nearby can give you a cool mist coming off the water when it is shot up into the air from the jets in the lagoon.

Walk between Disneyland Park and Disneyland California Adventure Park at Disneyland in California, as these parks are literally right next door to each other.,
Ride the monorail between the Downtown Disney district and Disneyland Park, if you prefer not to walk.",How to Travel Between Disney Parks1,"

Be ready to research the subject matter that the ride depicts.,
Research what rides at each of the parks you'll be visiting have any educational value.,
Keep an open mind and be willing to accept that rides do change over time, and that you might be having to add or subtract rides from your ""must teach"" list.

,
Preview the rides in real-time yourself.,
Ride the ride one more time with your kids in tow.,
Give the kids a wide variety of places that they can get taught the values in an educational standpoint.

,
Let your kids have a say, and make them explain how one ride educational concept can compare to another ride's same educational concept without much help.

",How to Teach Educational Concepts when Visiting the Disney Parks," Look into the various concepts of math and science (almost always physics-based concepts along with (especially in the case of Animal Kingdom park) Biology and Evolution) along with other educational values in various areas of the parks.;
, Almost most rides actually have some educational value, there are some that don't seem like it. And to avoid the disappointment of showing one that doesn't, research what values it tries to teach yourself.


Preview the newest copies of the rides you'll be wanting to teach, from YouTube.
Research on the Internet places where educational values can and will be taught.
Call the Disney Parks on a phone. Ask them what values the specific ride will teach this kids. Be willing to provide the age groupings of each of the kids if they vary in ages, and make it sound like you are planning an educational trip for a class of ""x (age)""-year old kids for an ""anonymous"" group of kids.

,, Try to see the ride from the viewpoint of the kid. Although almost all rides in Epcot's future world are devoted to educational concepts, there are some who can turn wild and be at disappointment for some. Realize you may have to tone the ride down to suit the age group.

, Point out each issue you'd like to mention, as you ride, unless the ride is so loud and fast you can't even feel your brain thinking. If the latter is apparent, point these points out after riding and note the exact points using ""landmark"" areas of information.

Decide if you truly want to visit Disney's Hollywood Studios.,
Drive and park at Walt Disney World.,
Purchase your tickets and enter through the turnstiles.

,
Realize that Disney's Hollywood Studios is spread into several ""lands"" placed sporadically throughout the park.,
Recognize that the first section you'll enter into as you enter the park is called Hollywood Boulevard and but that this land only gives you options for dining and shopping choices - there are no rides or attractions in this area.,
Walk down the walkway and recognize what choices of attractions you have in this section.,
Walk towards Rock 'n' Roller Coaster if you like roller coasters and Aerosmith is wild enough for you to try to mess with it.,
Take the up and down plunge at the Hollywood Tower of Terror hotel building around the corner.,
Watch the Beauty and the Beast stage show just after passing the shops on the long walkway down another short walkway on the opposite side of Rock 'n' Roller Coaster.

,
Note the placement of the Fantasmic show (if you have arrived during the daytime).,
Walk back to the hub of the park and take a breather, if you want.,
Take in a showing of the Frozen Sing-Along Celebration if you have fans of Frozen in your party.,
Visit Olaf at ""Celebrity Spotlight"" following a showing of ""Frozen Sing-Along Celebration"".,
Be sure not to pass up a showing of Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular if you'd like to know how some stunts on movies and TV shows are performed.

,
Pass into the Great Movie Ride right around the corner from Frozen Sing-Along Celebration.,
Pass back up into Echo Lake and continue walking towards the next section of park called ""Commissary Lane"".

,
Take a right when you see Echo Lake on your left and follow the long walkway down and around.,
Watch the 3-D motion simulator show Star Tours® - The Adventures Continue, if you don't mind the simulator.,
Continue down the pathway.,

,
Walk back past Echo Lake into Hollywood Boulevard and out the exit gate.

,
Walk back to your car and drive back to your hotel or home (dependent on where you live at the moment).

",How to Visit Disney's Hollywood Studios," Discuss some of your other options that exist for the other nearby Walt Disney World parks or local attractions in the area. With other major possibilities being the Magic Kingdom, Epcot, and Disney's Animal Kingdom and the mess of water parks and other activities that Disney sponsors, decide if Disney's Hollywood Studios is your best choice.


Realize that Disney's Hollywood Studios mostly tries to give people the ""lowdown"" on how certain things of the movie industry are produced for use on the big screen. They do have a few thrill rides here, but the thrill ride sector is still in it's infancy here.;
, Disney's Hollywood Studios doesn't have a monorail station to this park, so you'll either have to take a car or Disney's Magical Express bus to this park. The address to the Disney Hollywood Studios is located at 351 South Studio Dr, Lake Buena Vista, FL 32830.. The cost to park your car at the Magic Kingdom will run you about $17 for cars and upwards from there (depending on complexity of vehicle). Depending on how far into the lots it took you to get to park, you could be located in either the Film, Music, Stage, or Television parking lots that are located on campus. ,, Take a map and review your options in each area.

, Pass through and to the right at the first corner, as the hub of the park will be slightly straight ahead after this section has come and gone.

, This section is filled with two major ""wild"" thrill rides this park carries.

, Brave it, and entice yourself into riding.

, Both of these two buildings are at the farthest edge of this section of the park.

,, Fantasmic, the Disney Hollywood Studios nighttime spectacular show down along another long stretch of walkway here can be seen on most nights (even further out than the Tower of Terror).

, Near the hub you will find this area called ""Echo Lake"". It has a marsh-like lake with a green dinosaur named Gertie, which houses an ice cream shop. He was added here as a tribute to a lesser known animation, but was one of Walt Disney's primary influencing sketches., You'll hear and get to sing along with a few favorites from the Frozen movie. , This building is located right next to the building for ""Frozen Sing-Along Celebration"". After the show, usually you will hear an announcement inviting you to go meet the snowman.,, But be careful, as there are two separate rides nearby to one another - one is more thrilling than the other rather tame line ride. Don't try to scare your little ones if and when you go on the scary line. Warn the Disney Cast Member, otherwise you'll be put on the wrong one and end up scaring those young ones who shouldn't have been ""scared"" to begin with.


The two lines do come together past the point of the scare to present the history of movie-making.

,, You'll see a limited number of attractions there.

, If you do mind, you can pass this and continue on walking towards Streets of America.

, You'll come to a section of the park called Streets of America.

, Muppet Vision 3D, while well inspired by the antics of The Muppets from The Muppet Show is very funny, it is well liked by all who come for a visit.

, Action! Super Stunt Show that features several ""takes"" of cars and dangerous activities you wouldn't traditionally see. All people portrayed are actors who know their skit/routine well and know just how to perform these tricks without injuring themselves, and have protectant on as a ""just in case"" measure for the scenes involving fire.

, In one area you'll see the next and last of two more sections.

, You'll watch commentaries on Walt in Walt Disney: One Man's Dream.

,,,"
"
Gather as many sources as humanely possible of information regarding the locations of Hidden Mickeys around the park you'll be visiting.,
Plan your trip to the Disney Park of your choice.,
Look high and low and with a careful eye to detail, to spot those Hidden Mickeys that no one else has ever mentioned before.

,
Look even into the entrances and ""back-alleys"" in some of the resorts, as some may be in places you wouldn't have thought to have even checked otherwise.,
Walk around each park jotting down exactly how the hidden Mickey was formed, and try to be as descriptive as possible.",How to Visit a Disney Park In Search of Only Hidden Mickeys," Although some books directly relating to the subject appear on store shelves at most Barnes and Noble retailers, there are several lists online that prevail in listing locations (however, these are sometimes seldom updated so be careful).;
, With destinations in Florida and California, as well as France, Hong Kong and a few other places, you'll find plenty of Disney-inspired Hidden Mickey's to discover all over the Disney parks and resort locations.

,, Although you may come off as some weirdo, make sure to check around in some places most people wouldn't have even thought about looking for them. Just don't enter anyone's room without asking the guest's permission to look around in.

, These lists can be parts of your mementos from your trip.

"
Know that you're allowed to bring your own stroller.,
Tie a unique item on the handle.,
Get a stroller, no matter how old your child is.,
Try to think of strollers as child ""rest areas"".,
Acknowledge of the material of the rental strollers.,
Learn the locations of the stroller rentals.,
Know the rental prices ahead of time.,
Hold onto your receipts at all times during your stay.",How to Use Strollers at Walt Disney World," As any other public place, especially theme parks, caution and security are very much needed when the stroller is unattended.


If you fear of it being stolen while you're on a ride, you may find yourself having an adult stay with the stroller. This won't allow two adults to enjoy the same ride together with kids, so you may need to figure out which rides each adult will go on throughout the theme park.






Only collapsible strollers (commonly the single umbrella ones) are allowed on buses, parking lot trams, and monorails. Plan accordingly if you don't have a collapsible stroller and wanting to visit different sections. Also, during peak hours of the park, you will always have to perform stroller etiquette, so that everyone around you can enjoy the park as well. It's not fun at all when there's a stroller in your scenic view while traveling.

, Like trying to find your baggage at the airport, it will be a hassle to search for your stroller, especially if a cast member has moved it to a designated area while you're on a ride. Examples to use are balloons, a strip of a plastic bag, or tied yarn.

, Disney Parks are huge, and may look even bigger in a child's eye when it comes to walking. The Disney stroller rentals are not recommended for infants nor toddlers, so you may want to bring your own for smaller kids. The rentals are perfect for elementary school children and even extra storage for bags.

, It may be a good thought of parking yourselves somewhere for a rest, but time doesn't stop when you have a tight schedule. Allow kids to walk by themselves and be in the stroller whenever they get tired. This way, you're always moving and allowing them to rest their feet at the same time.

, The material of the stroller is a huge factor when visiting the theme park, as they are hard plastic, which can either be a ""make or break"" decision when putting temperatures and weather conditions into your plans. On hot days, it's essential to have a towel to relieve the heat from the plastic. On the other hand, if it drizzles or rains that day, you will need a towel or napkins available to wipe the water off.;
, As soon as you enter the Magic Kingdom, they are located at the entrance under the train station. If you wish to explore the other areas of the park, you must return it at the same location. Although, if you present a receipt at the different park, you can get a stroller at no extra charge.

Epcot (at the main entrance and International Gateway)






Animal Kingdom (at the Garden Gate Gifts)






Downtown Disney (Marketplace Strollers & Wheelchairs and DisneyQuest Emporium)






Disney's Hollywood Studios (at the Oscar's Super Service)







, A typical family vacation tends to be a few days to a week, so putting any stroller rental prices might be a good thing when visiting on a budget. Know that the Downtown Disney Park does ask for a $100 USD credit card deposit for a single stroller. You will need to return the stroller to the same location in order to receive the deposit back. Double strollers are not rented at the Downtown park.

Single strollers are $15 each day or can be rented for $13 on a multi-day visit. These are recommended for kids whom are 50 pounds or less.






Double strollers are $31 each day or can be rented for $27 on a multi-day visit. These are recommended for kids whom are 100 pounds or less.







, If you have misplaced a rented stroller or found out that it has been taken, you can get a replacement at no charge at certain stroller locations. Just be advised, that these are based on availability, so you may have to do location searching if needed.

Research the locations the monorail can be boarded from.,
Realize that some hotels have easy access to the monorail nearby their hotel.,
Prepare to board the monorail.,
Be prepared for a long wait.,
Walk up the incline that leads to the safety gate.,
Wait until the train arrives at the station.

,
Wait for the train to come to a complete halt.,
Walk up the train in an orderly fashion.,
Cross the platform onto the train itself.

,
Prepare to immediately take a seat.,
Listen for all announcements, as they are being made.,
Watch the monorail doors as they close.,
Listen to the overhead narration in the PA system.,
Look down (if it isn't too dark).,
Wait for the train to stop, when it arrives at the station.,
Get up out of your seat and walk yourself over to the exit gate, when you find you've ridden the monorail for long enough, or found the exit point you'll need to debunk at.

",How to Ride the Walt Disney World Monorail," Along with the route that takes you from the Magic Kingdom (sometimes nicknamed Disneyland, though these are two separate distinct parks), other locations can be found outside the Epcot gate and near the Transportation and Ticket Center (sometimes nicknamed by it's separate initials TTC).;
, The most famous one can be found at the Contemporary Resort (directly inside the hotel) along with others outside at the Grand Floridian and Polynesian Resorts.

,


Gather all your belongings and all members of your party who will need to be transported via the monorail.
Approach the applicable area that takes you to the monorail. There is a purple ""overhang"" with the title ""to (location) directly on the sign.
Realize that you can't go straight from the Magic Kingdom to Epcot without heading to the Transportation and Ticket Center location first. However, you can go from the Magic Kingdom to the resort locations on the same line. Be careful to board the ""resort"" monorail and not the Express, as taking the Express will bring you to the TTC instead.

, The area that contains the passengers who are also waiting, tend to become long. If you just missed the last train, chances are that other people may already be at the station waiting for the next one).

, Wait on the line for the next ""train"" to arrive. It's not too long, in most cases.

,, Moving trains may injure people. The monorail will keep the gates closed until they are ready to have members board. But just in case their safety systems fail (for some reason), just keep away from the train until the doors open and the exiting people stop exiting.

, Never run, and don't walk too slow either. Besides, you're probably tired from walking the park anyway, if this boarding is at nightfall after a long day of riding the rides.

,, If there are no seats available, keep standing and hold onto the top handrail.

, The announcements will signal safety concerns in both English and Spanish.

, The train will then begin moving slowly onward (forward).

, It'll explain what part of the journey you're seeing underneath the monorail car.

, You'll be surprised, especially if you are traveling from the TTC to the Epcot Station. You'll see most of the exterior portions of the attractions leading up to the station as it circles around the inner portions of the park.


If it isn't too crowded, consider looking at the opposite side's window.

, You may need to say on board, to find your intended target location.

Decide if you truly want to visit the Disney's Animal Kingdom.,
Drive and park at Walt Disney World.,
Purchase your tickets at the gated entry just before you enter the park.

,Enter through the turnstiles and into this park's first section called The Oasis.,
Look at the set up of Disney's Animal Kingdom.,
Look around The Oasis as you enter the park.,
Notice that there are two paths, and each path includes different animals.,
Let the kids explore around here.,
Walk across the bridge till you meet up at the Tree of Life.

,
Look directly at the Tree of Life, and find all of it's little carvings located on the Tree.,
Look for Discovery Island Trails.,
Circle to the right of the tree, and you'll notice another landmark.,
Have the kids explore and play in the Boneyard.,
Take a spin around TriceraTop Spin.,
Make a beeline for Primeval Whirl if you want to ride a rather mild roller coaster that is combined with the action of a tea cup-styled ride.,
Rev over on DINOSAUR if you love ""time rover"" expeditions.

,
Watch a performance of Finding Nemo - The Musical if your kids still haven't gotten enough theatrical performances so far.

,
March back out to Discovery Island and take a right.,
Take a ride on Expedition Everest, if you want some high-volume roller coaster action.,
Whitewater-raft down Kali River Rapids.,
Walk through the Maharajah Jungle Trek if you haven't done enough walking yet.,
Turn the corner that would lead you back into Discovery Island (onto the hub).,
Watch the Flights of Wonder show.,
Take a ride on Kilimanjaro Safaris.,
Take the Wildlife Express Train out to Rafiki's Planet Watch, if you would like.

,
Watch the exciting stage play called The Festival of the Lion King in the Harambe Theater.,
Become a wildlife expert, and see the park from the eye of one of its experts in the parks.,
Take the train back to the Africa depot, once you are done exploring in Planet Watch..

,Walk back through the Oasis and out the exit gates.",How to Visit Disney's Animal Kingdom," Discuss some of your other options that exist for the other nearby Walt Disney World parks or local attractions in the area. With other major possibilities being the Epcot, the Disney (Hollywood/MGM) Studios, and the Magic Kingdom and the mess of water parks and other activities that Disney sponsors, decide if this park is your best choice.
, The address to the Disney's Animal Kingdom is located at 551 Rainforest Rd, Lake Buena Vista, FL 32830 .The cost to park your car at the Magic Kingdom will run you about $17 for cars and upwards from there (depending on complexity of vehicle).Depending on how far into the lots it took you to get to park, you could be located in either the Butterfly, Dinosaur, Giraffe, Peacock, or Unicorn parking lots that are located on campus. ,,, This park is divided into about six lands around one central hub area/monument called The Tree of Life. These lands include The Oasis, Dinoland USA, Discovery Island, Asia, Africa and Rafiki's Planet Watch.. Due to construction issues in Camp Minnie-Mickey, this land isn't included anymore in the park.

, Notice that there are no rides or real attractions in The Oasis except a few animals. The Oasis houses only a few different kinds of animals. (The Oasis is an estuary 'per se.'.) Disney's Animal Kingdom is an 'animal sanctuary' and Disney wants to invite you to view some of its lovely animals it houses here, that it couldn't find housing for otherwise.

, There is one path on the west side and another path on the east side both joining at the same access point.

, Keep your eye on them as you help them understand these animals. Be the narrator of what these animals' names are. There are placards on or near the railings near the animal's enclosure (if you need help). Some kids like it if you use the animal's real name.,, This tree is the landmark item that Disney wanted to treat it's guests to in this park. Disney Imagineers added these little carvings to the Tree to give that tree its own special ""spark"".

, The trails can provide you an up-close look at the carvings inside the tree.

, If you enter through It's Tough to be a Bug's entrance, you will find that there is a 3D movie theater under the Tree. (Yes; there actually is a theater under the Tree itself, and a very tall theater for that reason too.) At the end of the movie, when you come out of the movie, you'll still be underneath the tree, but you'll be right in line for heading towards the next land, Dinoland USA.

, No school age children ever not dreams of playing with the bones they dig up here. But wait a little while to retrieve your kids. Make sure they can be comfortably within walking with you once again (for security reasons).

, If you've ever been on Dumbo at the Magic Kingdom, TriceraTop Spin is almost the same, though the ride vehicles you ride on are different. The ride sequence though is a few minutes longer, but is still definitely bearable for many adults and children alike.

, This ride surely will make your head spin!

,,, This will lead you over a bridge and into the ""Asia sector of the park.

, Expedition Everest is especially popular for most adults who come to this park, so try to be the first one in line if you arrive at the park gates at opening time.

, Kali River Rapids is an exciting whitewater-rapid riding ride that thrills almost everyone who rides it.

, Though you've put on many miles in your shoes, Maharajah Jungle Trek is a walking path which talks about various animal-based information.

, Walk yourself in the direction of Africa. Though you'll find the next attraction still technically in Asia, it's around the corner inside the ""hub""., With all the different birds and prey information they present, this is a popular show for some people looking for informative information about birds. Many people just bypass it in hopes of finding other ""better"" items to do at the park.

, If this is your first safari, you're in for a treat. Although this safari ride is ""kicked up a notch"", it's not much faster than an average car ride over an average two lane road through an African safari village.

,, Formerly in the Asian area, this stage play has moved around and has now been relocated to this area of the park.

, Rafiki's Planet Watch is primarily a conservation station.

"
Prepare yourself for several methods.,
Gather your children.,
Sit your children down on a soft surface such as a sofa/love seat or soft chair.,
Have them try to explain the meaning of some of the special Disney-esque pieces you should have nearby.,
Have them go on a scavenger hunt around the house.,
Tell your children a few fibs about their next plane ride, if you know they can't read that well yet.,
Use alphabetical refrigerator magnets to post a quick message on your refrigerator spelling ""We're going to Disney World."",
Purchase a customizable/personalized create-your-own jigsaw puzzle.,
Fill your home with items set in a ""Hidden Mickey"" type of style/pattern.,
Have the kids pre-program your GPS device by the digital location to the Walt Disney World park.,
Have your children check the gate assignment on your most recent tickets.",How to Surprise Your Kids with a Trip to Walt Disney World," Whether it's a scavenger hunt in your house or it's gathering Disney Parks-esque clues, or one of the many other ideas, prepare everything you'll need and bring it with you. in the case of the scavenger hunt however, you'll need to pre-load the locations with the proper ""next clue"" card along with the ""clue"" itself.;
, Whether these children are super young or teenage or slightly older, they all need to be nearby to gather the same information at the same time.

, Children will tend to leave the area before the big reveal if the surface is too hard.

, These items should include both the classic ""Disney-ears hat"" and ""Disney Parks map"". Tell them you have a map, and they must reveal what it says/means(make sure the Walt Disney World text at the top of the front of the map is scribbled out so they can't read it at a quick glance.

, As the first step initially stated, make sure the items are placed in the order you want your kids to go around to and from them. For them to end up at the right place each time, you too need to place them in the same corners that you want, for them to be able to decipher them well enough. Make sure there is also a Disney-esque prize waiting at each location. Make sure the last stop will end with the most-popular ""Now, guess where you're going?"" and tell them either out loud, or on the paper.

, Whether it's to fly to an unmarked location elsewhere in the US (when in real life it's really to Orlando International Airport/Walt Disney World), it'll become apparent when you get there.

, You may need several packages of these magnets, but you'll get the word out soon enough.

, The main attraction on the puzzle should be the reveal. For most older children, this is often fun for them to do, and shouldn't take them too long to complete.

, Set the glasses or plates, or even set pancakes on a plate in the style of a Hidden Mickey, and see if they can decipher what these styles of ""writing"" are. If you can't, you'll have break the news to them what they are. But use that type of reveal at last resort.

, Although their street address has their name in them, their DDMMSS location or decimal location of the park won't give this information out too quickly. They'll have to zoom out of the device, to see more clearly what place they are going to.


Touch-screen cellphone maps work better at showing the kids this. However, if you don't have one, a GPS or the like will have to do.

, When they discover the destination being ""Orlando"", they'll realize that they are going to Disney World.


The only thing kids think about when they hear ""Orlando"" is ""Walt Disney World"" (unless they live down in Orlando, in which case, they'll be puzzled).
When most parents plan a trip to Walt Disney World, they tend to choose to fly into Orlando's main airport hub: Orlando International Airport. Make sure you know it's three-letter airport code that all airline companies use (MCO). This three letter code can be quite confusing to a child, if they don't see the name of the city spelled out on the ticket.

For example, get the same taste of Disney magic with other nearby Disney-themed areas like Disney's California Adventure, a sister theme park, and Downtown Disney, for dining and shopping. Other amusement parks within the vicinity include Universal Studios of Hollywood, Knott's Berry Farm, and Six Flags Magic Mountain. The Southern California landscape isn't without its wealth of rides.;
, Bring plenty of water and sunscreen, wear a hat and comfortable shoes, and bring a warm layer or raincoat in case of bad weather. Bring snacks or even a sack lunch so that you can save some money throughout the day, if you want. Make sure you have enough money for your ticket, parking, food, and any souvenirs you'll want to buy, and bring a backpack or other bag that you can firmly close to carry everything without losing it to the winds while on a roller coaster., Disneyland and Disney's California Adventure have their drawbacks. One of these drawbacks is that in order to visit, you'll either have to park in the ""Mickey and Friends"" parking structure or ride the ART (Anaheim Resort Transit) tram to the park. The address to the parking structure is 1313 S Disneyland Dr, Anaheim, CA 92802. The cost to park your car at this park will run you about $17 for cars, and even more for different types of vehicles.


Due to the cost, it's often advised to ride the ART tram/trolley to get to the park.

, If you have to park in the structure rather than ride the ART trolley, take the free, park-operated tram to get to the park entrance. The tram ride is about five minutes long, and trams operate from just before the park opens to just after it closes, allowing you to spend as much time as you want in the park.


The tram also offers access to Downtown Disney and its wealth of shopping and dining options.

, Do this online before you arrive at Disneyland to avoid having to wait in a long line before even entering the park. If you haven't purchased tickets online, you can do so at the booths outside the park once you get off the tram.

, Present your ticket to the people monitoring the entrance, and present any backpacks or large bags to be briefly checked by security. You can also pick up a map or list of shows and other attractions at the entrance.


Make sure to retrieve your entrance ticket and keep it safe. You will need it later to obtain fast passes for various rides.

, This is a popular picture-taking spot, since it is the first place people see that makes people remark that ""they were there"" when asked by others! Walk onwards.

, This archway has a plaque memorialized with the words ""Here you leave today and enter the world of yesterday, tomorrow and fantasy."" This live steam railroad circles the entire park and is one of the oldest attractions at Disneyland, having been a part of the park since its conception., This park is formed into 8 lands centered around a hub called Sleeping Beauty Castle. These lands include Critter Country, New Orleans Square, Adventureland, Main Street USA, Frontierland, Fantasyland, Tommorowland, and Mickey's Toontown.The map lists the main attractions in each land. Study the map to learn about your options and decide what you might want to do and see., This is the large street, lined with shops, restaurants, and theaters, that leads from the entrance to the rest of the park. Although a few rides exist in this section, these are not the main attractions. There are several stage plays and theaters that exist here, along with several food establishments that glean in on this area.


Walt Disney's private residential window still exists with a candle inside the building above the Firehouse on Main Street USA., You'll be delighted in the facts that Honest Abe tells you about himself in his stage show.

, If the film is playing when you walk in, you may watch it; otherwise, look for a schedule and come back alter. It is rarely ever crowded here, as not many people come in for very long. The viewing area inside isn't handicap-accessible, so people don't tend to linger around there much.

, The train makes several stops on its tour around the park and returns to the Main Street USA station in about 20-30 minutes (sometimes it may go on for 30-40 minutes and depends on how many people get on and off the train during the trip around the park). (This tour is also called the Grand Circle Tour.) It has stops in New Orleans Square/Critter Country, Mickey's Toontown/Fantasyland, and Tomorrowland, and it'll take you through scenes of the Grand Canyon, Splash Mountain, and various jungle wildlife. It also stops by two dioramas including the Grand Canyon and Primeval World. There are generally three trains running concurrently.

, Folks who made a lasting impact on the park got their own window decal to prominently display their name. While some are true with their last and first, some aren't as easily recognizable and you'll need to try and decipher exactly who they mean. See how many you can find on the windows up and down Main Street. These include the names Ken Anderson, Marvin Davis, Claude Coats and Richard Irvine (amongst the many others)..

, While there is a fire engine that sometimes cruises the park from Main Street's Central Plaza), there are other items such as a horse-drawn streetcar, a trolley, horseless carriage and omnibus that run through this area stopping in front of Sleeping Beauty Castle in the park., Although the sign out front says just ""Featuring Steamboat Willie"", there are others that play here including ""Plane Crazy"" and many others. However, the entrance is a little dark upon entering, so watch out (raise your sunglasses if you have them on).

, Although the Emporium shop holds many great souvenirs, there are others here as well that handle other great items as well as much-coveted items at the Main Street Photo Supply Co, Disney Clothiers, and Disney Showcase, Newsstand, as well as the Silhouette Studio. If you'd like a hat, check out the Mad Hatter.

, Although the Candy Palace will serve you a specialty confectionary, there are more than enough choices to pass the time that you could eat here and never get bored. There's also a café, and an ice cream parlor (called Gibson Girl Ice Cream Parlor) and a bakery and a market house (which has Starbucks in it). For refreshing drinks, try the Refreshment Corner.

, It is the oldest building in Disneyland., This iconic statue stands in this park. It is a bronze statue of Walt standing next to and holding the hands of Mickey Mouse. There are plaques explaining this statue directly below it.

, This ride offers a fun submarine voyage populated by all your favorite characters from Finding Nemo. The line gets crowded by mid-day, so your best bet is to come early, or on a day when your ticket allows (if these privileges are on your ticket) the ""Extra Magic Hour"".

, This is a great place to meet Chewbacca and Darth Vader. If you have Star Wars fans with you, this is a must-see!, Much like the driving experiences at some theme parks, this one has fairly outlived its life, and the lines tend to be much longer than the ride merits per the time you spend going around the track or area of travel.

, Although this roller-coaster shoots you into space (or the way Disney looks at it), you'll soon be back at the starting gate all in one piece. This is a fast, thrilling ride through the pitch black of outer space, tons of fun for older kids and adults but potentially scary or uncomfortable for small children or those prone to motion sickness.


The line for Space Mountain is almost always over an hour, so think about using a fast pass to bypass the line on this popular ride.
Currently, Space Mountain has a Star Wars theme to promote Season of the Force. Lines will be longer than usual.

, Shoot at targets within the ride with your green and purple blaster. You can challenge yourself or the person in the seat next to you.


The line for this ride moves quickly and is almost never more than ten minutes, so ride this several times and try to beat your own scores from each previous round.

, The ride between the two areas takes about 8 minutes, but with breezes that run through the monorail windows (since theres no air conditioning in the cars), this may still be a decent place to cool down during the day and keeps you out of the sun. Keep your ticket available if you get off at Downtown Disney, as you'll need your ticket and current handstamp (they'll stamp your hand at the exit) for reboarding at that station's entry.

, Near Innoventions and the Monorail (near Space Mountain), spin the ball and run around in the fountains surrounding it. The ball will moisten and thereby cool down any person's hands in it's path.

, A ""dark ride"" according to Disney Park officials, just means that the ride takes place completely indoors and Disneyland's Fantasyland has five of them. These are rides where you sit in a car, ship, or other vehicle and proceed through several rooms that recount a story. Great for young kids, these rides include Pinocchio's Daring Journey, Snow White's Scary Adventures, Alice in Wonderland, Mr. Toad's Wild Ride and Peter Pan's Flight., Visit with Pinocchio and his friends as you ride through some of the scenes depicting the storyline from the movie made many, many years ago.

, Some kids may be scared to go in. It's dark in spots, it's dreary and the Witch looks scary and may intimidate some kids. You may end up riding the ride alone one time through and thinking if your kids might appreciate and understand the storyline that's told here.

, However, although most of this ride takes place inside a building, at one point you exit outdoors and then back in a few seconds later.

, Although it's name says ""Wild"" when you deal with this Disney attraction, the ""wild"" is Disney-controlled from within the ride vehicles' ride systems operation.

, You'll take a journey with Peter Pan off to Never Never Land in a journey you'll never, never (pun definitely intended...sorry) forget.

, This slow-moving ride makes its way around Fantasyland, and it's a great way to keep small kids enticed and your mind a little bit active (if you decide to ride it with them).

, Let the skipper take charge of the boat and learn about some of the stories Disney has shown to you in the past and you can relive this light.

Hear your guide recount classic stories and witness the scenes where they take place., Turn the steering-wheel shaped center wheel fast to make the ride spin fast, or spin it less for less of a spin. But no matter what you do, be careful not to make yourself too dizzy that you can't stand up and walk straight after the ride is over!

, One of the most popular places in the park, the carousel gets busy, but the line tends to move quickly, and kids tend to love a ride on a horse, unicorn, or even lion, bird, or one of the other animals that the carousel offers.

, Fly sky-high on an elephant, and soar through the air before making a safe landing to complete the ride. Press the switch up to make the dumbo character vehicle fly high or press the switch down to make it fly lower.

, Although the ride has been dazzling riders for more than 50 years (as of 2014), it can dazzle you too. Filled with scenes of 297 dolls and 256 ""toys"" singing and dancing the famous song (by it's title name) together over five languages and in six continent themes.[[ of the world, the ride represents a hope of peace and unity for all humanity. Beware, though - just one ride can keep that silly song stuck in your head for days on end.

, Take a ride in a bobsled through the Matterhorn mountain, through caves and past yetis that make the ride that much more exhilarating.

, See scenes from the classic tale and relive the story before returning to Fantasyland. There is a walk through exhibit that can only be experienced when passing through the castle's center area.

, Toontown offers clever architecture and access to all your favorite cartoon characters. If you want to wow a kid's eyes, this land is definitely the place to do it.

, A staple attraction for Mickey's Toontown, this ride impresses everyone who rides it. Plus, this one is the only one of it's kind within the Disney Park system, so ride it if you are near it.

, Whether you are willing to try a roller coaster for the first time, or you want a little thrill after woofing down that piece of pizza from a nearby dining location, this may be an intermediate compromise. It is rather tame, but can be great for small children, however it is out in the sun, so make sure to come prepared with sunscreen and plenty of water.

, These cruise boats offer calm, leisurely cruises on the river with plenty of exciting sightseeing.

, Ride a runaway mine car through the caves and bedrock in the early days of the California Gold Rush. A small but exhilarating roller coaster, this is a hit with kids who are up to conquering thrill rides and adults alike.

, Take the pathway to New Orleans Square and Critter Country, or head in the opposite direction towards Adventureland., Sing pirate shanties and sail through scenes from the Pirates movie, looking out for all your favorite characters.

, With over a thousand and one happy haunts, they all hope to keep you awake and to keep you out of their mansion, though few actually are able to keep you out.

,, This classic, super-duper, mega log flume ride with its five-story drop is definitely not for the faint-of-heart, but its scenes of animals dancing and singing together make it a great ride for all ages. The potential to be drenched makes it perfect on a hot southern California afternoon, Due to it's strength of lines in the afternoon, head straight for it on a day when your ticket provides ""Extra Morning Hours"" privileges before the park opens to most other guests as it gets crowded after the first hour that it is open, or come back near the park's closing time for the shortest lines. If you don't or can't come during these times, pick up a FastPass if one is available. If not, be prepared to wait for over an hour for this popular ride.

, This one is a staple attraction for most children.

, Try to take it in during the afternoon, right around most people's supper time, when the sun tends to scorch down on people. This show is an amusement you won't want to miss, and is definitely a retreat from the heat of summer.


Beware of waiting in line for this attraction on rainy days. The waiting area is out in the direct elements of weather. You can get rained on, if you aren't wise enough to sit underneath the talking tree bark near the payment desk for the Hawaiian luau foods booth.

, Ride a motion simulator ride through one of Indiana Jones' adventures, pulling daring moves and narrow escapes to make it out alive.

, Relax in a shaded boat and enjoy the commentary (filled with puns) of your guide as you explore the joys and dangers of the river. If you ride it at night, you'll get the added benefit of a colorful array of other fantastic colors.

, The parade travels from near the Small World ride through Fantasyland, around the hub down Main Street USA, and out through another gate only cast members use, and it happens at least twice per day.


Daytime parades vary. Check your guide map as you enter the park through the turnstiles, to see what parade you're likely to see and when.

, The Paint the Night parade is remixed soundtrack from Owl City's hit song, When Can I See You Again, and spectacle of tons of colors and lights galore, it's just a blast to watch from beginning to end. Although for a month, the lights and spectacular music of the Disneyland Paint the Night Parade took a short siesta of about a month (between September 6 and November 2016), this parade had made a comeback and will probably continue for a long time to come - as it is very popular with it's audience that line the streets where it runs along with up and down Main Street USA here.

, It's the everlasting history of the Main Street Electrical Parade which draws visitors from around the park to arrive to watch the floats float past that makes this another popular nighttime parade.

, These take place overtop of Sleeping Beauty Castle, though they can be seen from almost anywhere in Disneyland itself.


Some of the fireworks can be seen at some of the Good Neighbor Hotels/Resorts nearby, though no music is heard from that far away.

, At Downtown Disney, a bag check is performed.

""Selfie sticks"", used for cameras, or long stick attachments are prohibited from the park.However, camera handles that you can cover with your palm are acceptable.

, The Downtown Disney entrance is treated as the main entrance, and you will be required to show an admission ticket or card.

If you are experiencing the ""Extra Magic Hour"" or ""Magic Morning"", you will also need to show your hotel room key (if applicable) to use the monorail.
If you have entered the park earlier that same day, you will need to show your ticket along with a hand stamp.

, The normal wait can be anywhere between 10 and 25 minutes, as peak traffic hours and two hours before closing can result in a longer wait, depending where you are at. Please be advised the monorail may shut down during special events, such as parades and fireworks, so plan your time accordingly.

Like the park rides, there will be park employees to control the amount of people riding each monorail. Each depot will have a ""waiting area"" and a queue line. Remember these are two separate ""groups"", so the people in the waiting area will be allowed to board the monorail, and thereafter people in the queue line will be able to enter the waiting area after the monorail leaves the station.

, There's about five to six ""sections"" at each depot., The typical wait for a monorail is about five minutes., Moving trains may injure people.

,, At the park, there are big boards that show designated bus stops. In some of the resort locations there is just one stop for everything.

, Busses arrive and depart about every twenty minutes. So, be patient. Wait times after the parks close can be slightly longer although Disney does send more busses out.

, Take small children by the hand, watch your head, and step aboard.

, Allow elderly people or those traveling in wheelchairs to board first and to let them pick a better location for their seat (most often near or with) their family. You may stand, as long as you don't lean on the shuttle doors, stay behind any yellow lines, and hold a handrail or strap.

Begin planning your vacation.,
Realize that it's easy to forget small things.,
Research some of the most busiest places in some of the tour guide books available.,

Give her the details to which restaurants, on what days, and at approximately what time you are planning to be there.

,
Realize that you can also set up these reservations at either the Disneyland website or the Walt Disney World website, so no hope is lost, if some worst thing ever happens.

,
Plan on arriving to the location approximately 15 minutes earlier than your expected time.,
Be sure to bring information in regards to proof of exact time of your restaurant reservation.

",How to Reserve Seats at a Heavily Populated Disney Park Restaurant," Between planning airline, car rental and hotel accommodations and even booking some park tickets.;
, Try to plan on a piece of paper and write down everything you'll ever potentially need to solve for your trip. Even try to make a list of restaurants that are located near the hotel (if staying off Disney property) or restaurants in the hotel (if staying on Disney property) and park.

, You'll need to know what restaurants are super-busy and heavily populated when the guidebook tells you to order a seat in advance.


Generally, a Walt Disney World Restaurant is heavily populated because of an underlying theme is well-played out to every park visitor at every visit. Others have a theme, but it's not played out as well.

, Is it going to be breakfast, lunch, dinner, a snack during the day?

, Is this for a whole meal or is this a fast-take out experience?

, Generally, the number, no matter where you are calling from, is (407) 939-1936 (for Disney World)or (714) 781-DINE(at Disneyland) .

,,,,, Sometimes, even those holding reservations, tend to get pushed to the side for a few minutes past their reservation time.

"
Look towards the Times Guide you can pick up at the park's entrance.,
Try to plan your day around a schedule that is set up to meet with the characters.

,
Try to determine well in advance where the characters you are intending to meet can be found, so that you waddle over to the area with your kids, so they can meet with the characters in a way they feel most comfortable meeting with them.,
Know when and where they make special appearances.,
Know the difference between the classic characters and those of the special characters that may have been jazzed up for other occasions.,
Don't look to meet many characters in some areas of Disneyland's California Adventure Theme Park.,
Walk with your kids around the park in the direction of the area the character is to be expected to meet with guests on the given day.

,
Realize that some characters may not even be staged in any of the areas, and some may be walking the park much like you, the guest, do.,
Have an autograph book, camera and pen ready if you find this situation to be happening with the character nearby.,
Have the child interact with the character, if the character doesn't have other children nearby.",How to Meet Characters at Disneyland," This will help you find out which character will be found on hand at which time on any given day of the year. While a few characters can be found on premises each day, not all characters make an appearance, and the Times Guide will be able to tell you which ones you can see. Plan your times ahead of schedule, if there is a special character you'd like to see. Try to prevent meltdowns from beginning just by reading this schedule.;
,, At some points of the day, characters can be found in their house in Toontown USA (near Fantasyland).

, Some characters, especially classic Mickey and even sometimes Minnie, make special appearances around hundreds of thousands of fans in front of Sleeping Beauty Castle.

, These other characters may meet and sign kids books with the same name, but some kids become reluctant to see these characters when they don't look the same as what they are shown in movies and television.

, While some may make a few special appearances, this park is meant for the older crowd and adults, and few times characters don't think they may interact with kids in that specific park.

,, Some will walk and hope to catch your gleaming eye.

, However, when one child finds a character, most children speak up loud enough that other kids nearby will visit and character meets become ""scenes"".

, Some are more than willing to talk with the children than others. Don't let your child (or the child inside you) be discouraged if the character isn't allowed to say anything back. Some non-face characters are told not to speak with children for obvious reasons of breaking character, while most face characters (as Disney calls them) are more than willing to talk with most guests they encounter during the day. Non-face characters talk using hand actions and body language. They can still talk in their own way.


However, don't plan to take up the characters entire time, if the character is able to speak with your child. They can answer a question or two, but they'll need to consult with other fans too. Don't let your children feel insulted if the character answers a question and then walks off or talks with other children.

Figure out what time of year you will be going, because this will affect what you pack.,
Bring long pants such as jeans, any kind of shirt, with an extra jacket or hoodie for when it gets extra cold.

,
Bring shorts and thin tops if it is hot, because it can become extremely warm in Orlando.

,
Pack your sun protection.,
Bring a source of water so that you stay hydrated throughout the parks.

Understand the tiers of the FastPass+ system.,
Book your Disney vacation and FastPass selections well ahead of time.",How to Reserve a FastPass+ at Walt Disney World1," You can only select three FastPasses to start with, and they have to be in the same park and on the same day. Some parks also have a tiered system, so know ahead of time what you want to use your FastPass options on.


You initially get three FastPass selections in one theme park. If you want more, you'll need to switch into a different Disney Parks theme park to obtain others that day.(Apparently, an attempt by Disney to get you to buy the Park Hopper option onto your theme park tickets). Your choices will reset after the parks completely close off to guests that night, so the next day will start fresh. After you have used your first three fast passes you can book one more in any other park. Once you have used your fourth FastPass you can get another and so on, but this is based on availability.;
, Guests staying in Disney hotels can book FastPasses up to 60 days in advance. However, Non-hotel guests cannot book any of these selections until they get to the kiosk in the park. (Non-hotel guests however can read about how the tier systems work and which rides are paired on which pairs ahead of time on the Walt Disney World system website.)

"
"
Look for the kiosk signs.,
Scan your ticket(s) or MagicBand(s) once you are at the kiosk.,
Select the FastPasses you want and the times.,
Focus on reading the screen.,
Confirm your choices.

Don't wait around for a print out or separate confirmation of making your choices.,
Log out of kiosk.",How to Reserve a FastPass+ at Walt Disney World2," Some can be footpath signs and others are those mounted on light poles. Although the term Kiosk is located underneath the icon (which says FP+ in a navy-blue filled circle), the way these are constructed and exact placement in the park will vary.

, The scanning location is an RFID reader next to the computer system kiosk that has a front-face view of Mickey's head on it. It initially will light up red, but once scanned successfully, this red will change to green and will remain green until the end of your selection time. Scanning your ticket or MagicBand will pull up your reservations including your park ticket reservations that make your FastPass choices more personalized than the former system (FastPass) ever allowed.

, If you need help, there should be a Guest Relations employee standing nearby to help assist you. Reservants need to recognize that they need to have a Disney ID with the Disney company prior to scanning, and for that, if you haven't reserved or set up your account online, these Relations employees can help set one up for you - Look for a person with a tablet who will be wearing the Disney nametag and Disney employee Guest Relations apparel.

, The screen is initially a duplicate copy of the Walt Disney World website.

,, You won't receive any paper passes anymore. Your FastPasses will automatically be on your ticket(s) or band(s). Just scan them at the FastPass kiosk, every time you enter.


If you need a list of when the FastPasses are valid, consider bringing along a pencil and paper when you make your choices, or make your choices on your mobile app or through the Walt Disney Website (if you linked your park ticket to your ID online).

, Look around for an ""All done"" button. Tap ""yes"" if it asks if you are sure.

Don't worry, there will not be any magic spoiled by taking some time before your vacation and select some interesting attractions. Planning tips can be found in many travel guide books and websites.;
, You don't have to go up to every character, though. Try it at least once to see if you like it.

, If there's someone else with you who wants to go on rides that you don't like, try to make an agreement. Take turns in choosing what to go on so both of you will enjoy your experience.

, If you have the chance to go, then why not? You don't have to go to all of them, but try to visit as many as you can. It's fine to skip one or to miss some rides. Remember that it's about the quality, not the quantity.

, Don't sleep in. By the time you wake up, the whole world will be on its feet at the line-up of your favorite ride. Go to sleep early and wake up early to have lots of time and avoid stress.

Visit the Disney Park that the parade will be shown in.,
Pick up a brochure (that contains the park map of your language) upon entry.,
Look for the parade route on the park map.,
Look at the Times Guide brochure for the parade times.,
Stake out some of the viewing locations for the one parade.,
Look for key signs that a parade might be taking place within the right area.,
Look for spaces to the left and right of the park benches, if the benches themselves are filled up seconds after the last parade moves forward from the point of the pole-bearer (""The End"" bar and sign) forward.

,
Try to always arrive at these benches at least two hours before the second parade comes through, and don't ever leave the space unmanned unless another credible person in your party can honestly save you your seat.

",How to Get an Empty and Great Seat at a Disney Parks Parade,";
, Disney Parks park maps aren't just written in English and Spanish. They also have a variety of other languages to choose from, but you'll have to scout out additional languages that the brochure is written in, to find out the information you'll need later.

, The parade route will be marked on the map by some type of dotted or broken line. Parade routes differ between the different parks. Whether it's the Magic Kingdom in Florida to Disneyland in California to California Adventure across the walkway, or if any of these compared to Disney's Disney-Studios/MGM or Disney's Animal Kingdom they all contain different routes, and you should be aware of these routes.

, Most Disney parks parades are given twice a day. It will likely list the two parade times when the parades will be given. Generally, if the parade marchers march one way, they'll tend to march the other way come later in the day to return to ""home-base"".

, Look for benches that seem to be crowded with people, and even where people tend to ""sit"" at least 30 minutes before.

, Not only will you tend to see people sitting on benches, but in some places there may be places where people tend to sit (near the edge of the sidewalk). Look for those tape markings can give you signs that a parade will soon be marching along the area where you are presently walking.


Disney park Cast Members don't want anyone to sit on the edge of a sidewalk near the parade and will usher you back from it. They will mark it with a special ""special event ongoing tape"")) to mark the parade route.
Another key aspect to look for is the possibility of seeing street-car like rails tucked into the streets. These are regularly used for each of the floats that most of the Disney parades carry.

Don't try to eat anything while sitting on the ride.",How to Keep Safe When Riding the Rides in a Disney Park," Disney follows strict safety rules, and will only begin the ride once every person is seated. There is no need to run to get to a particular seat. Every seat on most rides have the same vantage points.;
, Make sure to do this, right after getting in.

, Listen to them! Some seats have more harder-enforced sides, as well as a better center of gravity.

,,, On some rides, the ride attendant will ask you to lower it yourself, while some may automatically lower without any single force exerted.


Do not block the bar from coming down onto you by any means, by putting any item on your lap (including children or other items).
Don't allow smaller children to sit on a bigger child's laps. Unless told to do differently by the station attendant otherwise, only keep one person per seating area. Failure to do so, could cause the safety-bar to malfunction and the ride to completely not leave the station entrance

, Not only do some rides have turns that could could cause the rider to not experience a sudden change that could confusingly cause your brain to misinterpret this change, but doing so could cause you to choke.

If you order early enough, you can have your tickets shipped to your house before your trip. Or, you can download e-tickets and print them directly from your email. You can get tickets cheaper on various different websites too.


Keep an eye out for deals. Disney will occasionally run promotions that add an extra day to a multi-day ticket at no cost.
Know what you're buying. If you only want to go to Disneyland Park, not California Adventure, there's no need to buy a ParkHopper ticket. Simply purchase a one-park ticket.
If you plan on parking at Disneyland, you can buy your parking pass online as well.;
, Early morning is the perfect time of day at the park: it's mostly empty, temperatures are cool, and the kids are still happy. You can get FastPasses and knock out a few of the popular rides before the crowds get crazy. People start to queue up at the park gates about an hour before opening.


If you want to do the Fantasyland rides, do them in the morning before all the families show up — the lines will never be shorter.

, The system can seem a little intimidating at first, but it's easier than it looks — and worth skipping the standby lines. Here's a quick rundown on how the system works:


You can get new FastPasses every 90 minutes. Dispatch someone to get your first round as soon as you walk into the park. (He or she will need to take everyone's park tickets along.) If you're not sure when 90 minutes is up, the next time you can get FastPasses will be printed at the bottom of your most recent ones.
Each ride that allows FastPass use will have a little FastPass station with four to eight FastPass machines. You stick one ticket at a time into the machine, and it will spit out a paper fastpass below that has a one-hour window of time printed on it. They have to be used on the day you got them.
Once you have your FastPasses and the first time printed has passed, you walk up to the FastPass line instead of the standby line, which should be clearly marked for each ride. The person at the front will check your passes to make sure they are valid, then you hang onto them and give them to a second person at the end of the line.

FastPass times are now being enforced! If your ticket says 1:45 to 2:45, you must show up between those times.
Some popular rides will run out of FastPasses. If you really want to fastpass Space Mountain, Indiana Jones, the Haunted Mansion (during Halloween/Christmas) or AstroBlasters, do it early in the day. Some of the other rides that utilize the FastPass service (like Big Thunder Mountain Railroad or Splash Mountain) will have short lines at the end of the day anyway, and you won't need FastPasses.

, Food inside the park can be expensive, especially if you're feeding a family, though there are some unique dining experiences you can try. Here's a rundown of what might work for you:


Eat meals earlier than usual, or after the mad lunch rush of 11am-2pm and the equally mad dinner rush between 6:30-8:00pm. This way, you can go on rides while everyone is eating and avoid lines when you're ready to eat.
Be warned that New Orleans Square eateries have the worst lines. Head over to Frontierland or Critter Country for shorter lines.
If you're eating cheaply: Pack lunch and dinner, and stash your meals inside a locker (near the park entrance). There are plenty of tables around the park for you to sit and eat, and picnicking on Tom Sawyer Island can be a good way to cool off in the afternoon. If you do need to buy food in the park, fruit is generally cheap and portions at the fast-casual eateries are large enough to split between two people.
Make advance reservations for any full-service dining. There are only a few sit-down restaurants inside Disneyland, such as the Blue Bayou and Cafe Orleans, but they fill up quickly. If it's really important to you to eat at these places, make an advance reservation with Disney Dining at (714) 781-3463.
Plan ahead with character dining. Character dining is offered at the Plaza Inn — where costumed characters will roam the restaurant to take pictures and interact with guests as they eat. This is an easy way to get some character time if you have kids, but it tends to be expensive and fill up quickly. Your best bet is to make reservations in advance at (714) 781-3463.

, Not all rides have FastPasses and waiting is inevitable, and it will save you a bunch of money! Bags of cereal, popcorn, granola bars, grapes, and peanut butter & jelly sandwiches are great to pack, along with a DS or iPod.

, As with eating, there are a few different ways to manage souvenir shopping depending on your needs. Here are a few possible game plans:


If you want to wear the famous mouse ears (or any other headgear), consider buying them at the beginning of the day so they'll be in all your photos.
If you're not sure what you want, pass through a few souvenir shops during the heat of the day or when you need a break. If something catches your eye, return to buy it as you walk out of the park, so that you don't need to carry it around all day.
If you have little ones and you're concerned about souvenir whining, try this trick. Buy Disney souvenirs less expensively online and pack them with you. The night before you go to Disneyland, arrange your kids' souvenirs as if Mickey came and left them overnight, like Santa. They already have new fun things to play with, and you don't have to worry about shopping at the park. Problem solved!

, If you have kids, seeing costumed characters is probably high on your list of things to do. Though characters used to roam freely around the park, they're now found at designated areas:


If you want to get character autographs, make sure you have a pen big enough for the characters to grasp — they won't be able to maneuver a small ballpoint pen as easily as a large marker.
Visit Toontown. For an audience with Mickey or Minnie, visit their houses inside Toontown. Be prepared to wait in lines, though. Other costumed characters should be wandering around Toontown as well.
Visit the Princess Fantasy Faire: If you want a picture with a princess, this is pretty much the only place to get one. Try to go early, since the wait can be up to 2 hours on peak days. To get to the faire, walk toward it's a small world, turn left, and keep walking past the Toontown gate. Or, you can simply take the Disneyland Railroad to the Toontown stop.
Visit Pixie Hollow: Pixie Hollow is another area with specialized characters, located between the Astro Orbiter and the Matterhorn. As with the princess faire, the lines can be long.
Wait at the secret character gate. To snag characters as they enter the park from backstage, wait at the gate in the northeast corner of Main Street, between the Main Street Cinema and Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln. Characters will periodically appear here to pose for photos and sign autographs. There is also one between the Main Street Camera Shop and the Plaza Inn, and one next to the bathroom that is off the Hub and outside of Tomorrowland.
Go to Alice and the Mad Hatter's Musical Chairs at Refreshment Corner at the end of Main Street. Although only little ones can play, this is a fun event to watch for all because of Alice and Hatter's antics. The Times Guide does not publish the time. so ask the piano player as early as possible what time this will be at!

, Disneyland hosts a few parades throughout the day, depending on the season, as well as night-time showings of Fantasmic and fireworks. (Check the park schedule to see what will be happening when you're there.) Most shows are crowded, but you can manage to get good seats with some clever planning.


For parades: Head toward Tomorrowland, and right before you enter turn left and follow the path to the King Triton Statue. This is a great spot to see the parade without all the people.
For Fantasmic: Fantasmic seating is tricky, but doable. If you really want prime seating right by the waterfront (directly in front of Cafe Orleans, by where people board boats to Tom Sawyer Island), your safest bet is to set out a blanket a few hours before the show and rotate who gets to sit and hold the spot. If there are two shows that night, your best bet is to be hovering in the area just as the first show wraps up. As soon as people start to get up and exit the area, swoop in and grab a seat.
Fireworks: Most people crowd to watch fireworks in Main Street, so they can see them going off behind Sleeping Beauty's Castle. If this is what you want to do, try staking out a a bench in the central square, by the statue of Mickey and Walt, or snag an outdoor table at the north end of the Gibson Girl Ice Cream Parlor.
Alternate fireworks: If you don't mind missing the castle panorama, the fireworks are also visible from the path that connects Frontierland and Fantasyland, behind Big Thunder Mountain. Or, if you like roller coasters, riding on Big Thunder offers a spectacular view of the show — and the line for the ride is usually short enough that you can go multiple times throughout the fireworks.
If you don't want to see any of the shows, then it's a great time to hit the rides while everyone else is preoccupied. Attractions like Splash Mountain and Space Mountain are usually easier to get on during Fantasmic and fireworks.
Enjoy smaller shows like the Dapper Dans or Mickey and the Magical Map.

, No one wants to feel pressured on going something they don't want to. Maybe they'll want to go after they see how much fun you had on the ride. In the meantime, jump in the single rider line and get on the ride much faster.

, The park generally stays open later during the summer and on the weekends, closing earlier during the colder months and on weekdays. However, certain areas will close down sooner if shows are happening. Here's a quick rundown:


If Fantasmic is showing, Tom Sawyer Island will shut down around sunset.
If there will be fireworks, Toontown will close early.
Fantasyland is one of the first areas of the park to shut down at the end of the night, so don't assume you'll just go on the rides there once the crowds clear out.
Specific closing times are posted on most rides.

, There will be a mass exodus out of the park right after fireworks (or about an hour before closing if there are no fireworks). The walk will be slow, and the lines for the tram back to the parking structure will be long. If you want to avoid the rush, you can leave halfway through fireworks or stick around until the park closes."

Look carefully because each audition is looking for something in particular -- parade performers, male comedic actors, look-alikes, etc. You may need to travel to find the audition you're really looking for. You shouldn't show up to a Mad Tea Party audition even if you're Jasmine's doppelganger unless you want to sip tea with Alice!
Each audition is open. You simply need to check-in early the day of the audition. They may fill up however, so the only thing you absolutely need to do is be prompt.;
, Most Disney characters have a specific look, even if you're not one of the ""faces."" You gotta fit the suit, after all. Mickey, Minnie, and other fully outfitted characters have less strict guidelines, but guidelines nonetheless. For example, princesses can't be above 5'7"". And you gotta be at least 18 -- and under 27, though that rule is technically unwritten.


There's a physique look too, obviously. Characters without full suits must look like their character; those in suits must fit in it comfortably. It all depends on who you're playing (and you may be assigned to play several).
In general, Disney prefers their ""faces"" not to have distinguishable features. For example, if Cinderella has a huge mole on her face one day and then it is ""gone"" the next, children may get suspicious. That's just how it is.

, It's best to have your headshot prepared on normal letter paper, with either your resume directly printed on back or attached. Make sure it's crisp and new and everything is up to date. If you have blonde hair in your headshot but blue hair in real life, they may consider it all out-of-date! You want to give the best first impression possible.


If you don't already have a headshot and resume, get on that! Find a friend that's a blooming photographer and ask them if you can be a (free) guinea pig. Then get on a quick internet search to see what your resume should look like. It's not that daunting of a process if you get on it now!

, For each type of audition, you'll need a way to prove your chops. It's all fairly logical: for a singing audition, prepare 16 bars of a song. Acting? A monologue. Comedy? Brush up on your improv. Musician? a selection of three pieces to show your versatility. Basically bring your A game for whatever the audition calls for.


It's always good to have a back up, too. You don't want to see the three girls in front of you all singing, ""Good Morning Baltimore,"" knowing that's your song, too. Always, always, always have a back up.
If you're looking to be a specific character, study the movie. If you can bust out Snow White at a moment's notice, the judges are bound to be impressed.

, You don't need to be a professional dancer, but a background and experience in choreography helps. So get to work on those split stretches and have your dancer friend teach you a few bits beyond that jazz square you've been whipping out at all those weddings. Every little bit helps!


Be careful in stretching. If you over stretch (especially when your muscles are cold), you could hurt yourself and have less flexibility for the day of the audition. Always exercise caution when it comes to your body!

, You want to be fully rested and raring to go for the morning of the audition. Your nerves will probably be on high alert, so do your body as many favors as you can by getting a full 8 hours of sleep. If you're lacking any energy, it'll be tough to give it your all.


While you're at it, eat a decent, normal breakfast. You don't want to eat anything too different in case it upsets your stomach, but do eat something substantial enough to get you through the morning. You could be waiting a long time.

, Registration will open up an hour or two beforehand; just to be safe you'll want to get there on the early side of that. You can then take time to stretch, calm down, and size up your competition. They'll ask you for your headshot and resume and direct you to a place where you can wait, wait, and then wait some more.


Once you get there, only auditioners will be allowed in. So your family/cheerleaders may have to go on their merry way once you're in. Hey, this way you can make friends!

, You'll probably be doing some sort of movement even if it isn't technically dance (though it could be dance), so make sure you're wearing something comfortable. Do not dress as the character you are auditioning for -- auditioning for Ariel wearing a mermaid's tail can only lose you points.


If you're not looking to be any type of dancer, they'll probably have you doing improvised scenes. This is where you mime anything from packing a suitcase to experiencing ice cream the first time to chasing after the guy who stole your hat. You could be running around quite ferociously!
It may take a while and you may get a little thirsty, so bring your own bottle of water. And whatever else you may need! Chapstick, anyone?

, Sometimes these things take ages, especially if there's hundreds of you. They can only take so many people at once, so you may siphoned off into a waiting room more than once. Be friendly and positive -- you never know who might have some pull!

, Whatever your audition is -- be it busting out a song or doing pirouettes down the hallway, rock it. Be confident and remember to smile! You got this. You're prepared. You're just as good as everyone else here.


If you're in auditions for a specific character, just be conscious of not dropping it. They're looking for someone who's this person in mind, body, and spirit. Every little quirk, every little movement, has to be this character. It's no longer you -- it's how Cinderella would pack a suitcase, it's how Goofy would pirouette down the hallway. From the tips of your fingers to the tips of your toes, you are this character.

The first part of the audition will be the dance, unless you're in a musician's audition. Although it is not very complicated, if you are unable to master the dance you will not be able to continue to the second part of the audition. After the dance, the judges will give you a scene they would like you to act out (eg. Goofy getting/decorating a Christmas tree, you getting your favorite dessert).



, Judging can take a while. After the audition it is pretty much a waiting game and that's about it. Trust that they'll get a hold of you, that you wrote down your phone number and email correctly, and that you'll know the verdict in time.

, Congratulations! You made it. Now it's time to start training! This will probably be around a week's time. You'll have different expectations depending on your role or roles received. If you're a prominent character from a movie, they'll ask you to know the movie (and your character) like the back of your hand. We're talking quoting-the-entire-thing-from-memory back of your hand. How they move and interact, too!


If you're a suited character, they'll have you concentrating more on mannerisms and the handwriting. After all, if a child gets two Goofy autographs, they gotta look the same!

, All times. They have to be animated and brought to life even when it seems like no one's looking (though someone is always looking). That means when a child asks you, Pocahontas, what your opinion on the Internet is, you must respond with, ""..Inter...net? What is this Internet of which you speak, young one?"" Even if they say, ""Hey, look! Goofy!"" Goofy is not in your world. That's a talking dog! Woah!


Disney can get pretty serious about this. From your words to frowning too much, they can get on you about it. Of all the rules, this is the most important. And it makes sense! If you don't keep up the magic, you'll ruin it for the kids who have been waiting their entire lives to experience the Disney magic.

, Apart from the above golden rule, there are a whole bunch of other ones, too. No sitting, strict break times, no saying no to pictures or autographs, etc. and so forth. So play nice and listen to 'em! Most of them are there for a reason.


Unfortunately, being a Disney character isn't all fun and games (no job is). The pay isn't phenomenal (you get to dress up, isn't that incentive enough?) and there's a definite pecking order a la mean girls (""faces"" before ""furs""). But many workers say that even after months or years of working there, they still feel the Disney magic.

, At the end of the day, you are creating something beautiful for the people at the park. The children there truly believe they're in a magical, wonderful place and they are. It can be the happiest place on Earth. Relish the moments you have being a part of it. You probably won't ever have another job like it!

Stay in the same area.",How to Get a Great Seat for a Disney Parks Evening Event," Usually, if you decide an hour beforehand that you're going to see a show, you will likely end up not getting a good seat, unless the park is not very busy. Therefore, try to look at the schedule before your trip, or at least the day before, and decide that you're going to see the show.
, Whether you are going to Disneyland, Walt Disney World, or one of the other parks, research online: ""The best places to view _______ (the name of what event you're seeing)"". Most of the time, you will see a list of areas pop up around the park that are the best places for viewing that event. Some of them may even be lesser known, so you may not deal with as big of a crowd., At some parks, some of the shows may offer a dining package, which allows you to eat at a select restaurant, and get a guaranteed seat for the event. They may be a bit more pricey, but if you're willing to spend, then do it., This is especially important if you arrive closer to the event time. You may get taller people in front of you, unfortunately, or you may have parents who put their kids on their shoulders. Therefore, try to pick a good spot that has little chance of getting an obstructed view, and you'll have one of the best seats., If you want the best chance of getting a good spot, plan on arriving an hour before the event, possibly even earlier if the park is more crowded on that day. If you arrive ten minutes before the event is due to start, you're a lot less likely to get a good spot., If you must leave to do something, make sure that it's extremely quick, and try to have another member of your party stay in your spot while you go."

Have kids who can't go on rides?",How to Have the Perfect Day at Disneyland2," If the crowds are thin and your energy is high, it's possible to do both parks in the same day. Try to arrange your schedule so that you're not constantly criss-crossing between the parks, or you'll end it with some sore feet.

, Instead of waiting in line to buy tickets at the park, buy them in advance online via Disney's official tickets website. If you order early enough, you can have your tickets shipped to your house before your trip. Or, you can download e-tickets and print them directly from your email.


Keep an eye out for deals. Disney will occasionally run promotions that add an extra day to a multi-day ticket at no cost.
Know what you're buying. If you only want to do both parks in the same day, buy a ParkHopper ticket.
If you plan on parking at Disneyland, you can buy your parking pass online as well.

, Early morning is the perfect time of day at Disneyland: it's mostly empty, temperatures are cool, and the kids are still happy. You can get FastPasses and knock out a few of the popular rides before the crowds get crazy. People start to queue up at the park gates about an hour before opening.


Both Disneyland Park and California Adventure open at the same time, so pick which one you'd rather do first. California Adventure used to be the emptier of the two early in the day, but that might not be the case anymore with the popularity of the new Cars Land area. Your best bet is to pick the park that has the rides you really want to go on first. California Adventure does close earlier than Disneyland Park.
If you want World of Color seats, it's probably a good idea to do California Adventure first. (More information below.)

, The system can seem a little intimidating at first, but it's easier than it looks — and worth skipping the standby lines. Here's a quick discussion of how the system works:


You can get new FastPasses every 90 minutes. Fast Passes are a completely free way to get the most of your time at Disneyland. Dispatch someone to get your first round as soon as you walk into the park. (He or she will need to take everyone's park tickets along.) If you're not sure when 90 minutes is up, the next time you can get FastPasses will be printed at the bottom of your most recent ones.
Each ride that allows FastPasses will have a little FastPass station with 4 to 8 FastPass machines to dispense the necessary FastPass ticket. You stick one ticket at a time into the machine, and it will spit out a paper fastpass below that has a one-hour window of time printed on it. They have to be used on the day you got them.
Once you have your Fastpasses and the first time printed has passed, you walk up to the FastPass line instead of the standby line, which should be clearly marked for each ride. The person at the front will check your passes to make sure they are valid, then you hang onto them and give them to a second person at the end of the line.

FastPass times are now being enforced! If your ticket says 1:45 to 2:45, you must show up between those times.
Some popular rides will run out of FastPasses. If you really want to Fastpass a certain ride (such as Radiator Springs, Soarin' Over California, California Screamin', or Midway Mania or Tower of Terror), do it early in the day. Some of the other rides that use FastPasses will have short lines at the end of the day anyway, and you won't need FastPasses.

, Food inside the park can be expensive, especially if you're feeding a family, though there are some unique dining experiences you can try. Here's a rundown of what might work for you:


Eat meals earlier than usual, or after the mad lunch rush of 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. and the equally mad dinner rush between 6:30 to 8:00 p.m. This way, you can go on rides while everyone is eating and avoid lines when you're ready to eat.
Be warned that, for California Adventure, the Fisherman's Wharf and Cars Land eateries have the worst lines. Head over to Hollywood Land or Paradise Pier for shorter lines. For Disneyland, New Orleans Square is the busiest; hit Critter Country or Frontierland instead.
If you're eating cheaply: Pack lunch and dinner, and stash your meals inside a locker (near the park entrance). There are plenty of tables around the park for you to sit and eat. If you do need to buy food in the park, fruit is generally cheap and portions at the fast-casual eateries are large enough to split between two people.
Make advance reservations for any full-service dining. There are only a few sit-down restaurants inside Disneyland, such as the Blue Bayou and Cafe Orleans, but they fill up quickly. There are several more in California Adventure, such as Carthay Circle and the Wine Country Trattoria. If it's really important to you to eat at these places, make an advance reservation with Disney Dining at (714) 781-3463.
Plan ahead with character dining. Character dining is offered at the Plaza Inn (Disneyland), as well as Ariel's Grotto (California Adventure) — where costumed characters will roam the restaurant to take pictures and interact with guests as they eat. This is an easy way to get some character time if you have kids, but it tends to be expensive and fill up quickly. Your best bet is to make reservations in advance at (714) 781-3463.

, As with eating, there are a few different ways to manage souvenir shopping depending on your needs. Here are a few possible game plans:


If you want to wear the famous mouse ears (or any other headgear), consider buying them at the beginning of the day so they'll be in all your photos.
If you're not sure what you want, pass through a few souvenir shops during the heat of the day or when you need a break. If something catches your eye, return to buy it as you walk out of the park, so that you don't need to carry it around all day.
If you have little ones and you're concerned about souvenir whining, try this trick. Buy Disney souvenirs less expensively online and pack them with you. The night before you go to Disneyland, arrange your kids' souvenirs as if Mickey came and left them overnight, like Santa. They already have new fun things to play with, and you don't have to worry about shopping at the park. Problem solved!

, If you have kids, seeing costumed characters is probably high on your list of things to do. Though characters used to roam freely around the park, they're now found at designated areas. Here's what you need to know:


If you want to get character autographs, make sure you have a pen big enough for the characters to grasp — they won't be able to maneuver a small ballpoint pen as easily as a large marker.
Characters do still wander around California Adventure, most notably in A Bug's Land. If you want to up your odds of running into costumed characters, though, your best bet is Disneyland. See the section above for more information.

, If you'd rather see Fantasmic or the fireworks, see the shows section above for how to do so in Disneyland. World of Color shows exclusively in California Adventure, with two shows a night during peak season and only one during the off season. If you'd like to see World of Color, though, here's a guide to both general seating and dining passes:


Get a fastpass for general seating. World of Color seating is divided into different areas by (you guessed it) colors, and the color for your area will be printed on your fastpass. Grab everyone's park tickets, head over to Grizzly River Rapids to the World of Color fastpass machines, and get a ticket for each separate person. If the same color is on each fastpass, you're good to go.
About an hour before world of color starts, head to the general seating area on Paradise Pier, where a cast member will direct you to your seating area. General admission is standing room only, so if you want to be up-close and sit down, arrive extra early. (Though be prepared for some splashing in the front seats!)
Do World of Color Dining. If you want a meal and a sure ticket for the show, you have two World of Color Dining options. You can pick up a picnic meal at any time during the day and get a guaranteed general seating pass with it, or eat a full-service prix fix meal with prime seating and viewing. See Disney's World of Color Dining page for more information.

, The parks generally stay open later during the summer and on the weekends, closing earlier during the colder months and on weekdays. However, certain areas will close down sooner if shows are happening. Here's a quick rundown:

On the weekends and during peak season, California Adventure will close an hour before Disneyland.
If Fantasmic is showing, Tom Sawyer Island will shut down around sunset.
If there will be fireworks, Toontown will close early.
Fantasyland is one of the first areas of the park to shut down at the end of the night, so don't assume you'll just go on the rides there once the crowds clear out.
Specific closing times are posted on most rides.

, There will be a mass exodus out of the park right after fireworks (or about an hour before closing if there are no fireworks). The walk will be slow, and the lines for the tram back to the parking structure will be long. If you want to avoid the rush, you can leave halfway through fireworks or stick around until the park closes.


If you're leaving through California Adventure and you're at Paradise Pier or Grizzly Peak, consider taking a shortcut through the Grand Californian Hotel. Exit the park at the hotel, directly across from Grizzly River Rapids, walk through to the lobby, hang a right, and walk past the convention center, following the signs to Downtown Disney. Once you're outside, turn right again to walk toward the parking tram.

, Go back to your hotel and rest a bit. The crowds and heat can be overwhelming so it's important to cool off and have a chance to get out of the park. You don't want anyone getting grumpy.

, Using your cellphone for apps and picture taking, will burn down the battery. It's important to have a working cellphone in case you and a family member or friend get separated.

, If you've never been to Disneyland, gather everyone in your party and ask them one thing they want to accomplish while at Disneyland. Maybe it's seeing all the character houses in ToonTown or going on Splash Mountain. That way everyone feels accomplished.

, While it's necessary to get a little bit stressed about costs, carrying around a notepad and a calculator is not the way to go. Bring your own water and food, or bring a notebook instead of buying an autograph book. If you're stressed about money all the time, no one's really focusing on fun, but how much money they can save.

, Ask for rider switch pass! While one rider waits in line, the other rider stays back and watches the kiddos. Then when the rider has finished enjoying their ride. The other rider takes the past and zooms to the front of the line.

Stay for the evening.",How to Enjoy a Trip to Disneyland," Several days before you go to Disneyland plan your trip, especially if you want to stay for more than a day. Disneyland is a big place, but in one day you should be able to enjoy most of the park's rides and shows. Nevertheless, a Disney visit lasting at least two days will allow you to take a more leisurely pace, rest more when you feel like it, and enjoy your favorite attractions more than once. In any event, one day or many, a trip to Disneyland will involve some planning ahead.


How are you going to get to the park? Are you driving? Flying and then renting a car? Going with a charter tour? The options are many, and you can consider them online with a vacation travel site.
You'll need lodging for a multi-day visit. Book a hotel or motel room in advance, just to be sure you'll have a place to stay. This, too, can be handled online.
You can buy Disneyland tickets at the gate, but you may be able to find them cheaper online, especially group and multi-day packages. Airfare,car rentals and lodging can often be bundled with tickets online.
Even if you're going for just a day, you'll want to pack up a few things the night before to bring along. This might include light jackets (because most of the year southern California can be a bit chilly early in the day and in the evenings). Consider bringing food, too, if you expect to bypass Disneyland's many wonderful eating spots. If you will have young children with you, water bottles might be a good idea.
Don't forget to check the Disneyland website for information on seasonal hours, promotional ticket sales and special events.;
, As you near the park, you will drive past a number of hotels and places to eat. Treat yourself to breakfast before entering the park, because many eateries in Disneyland don't open until lunchtime.

, After you park, a tram will take you to the main entrance. Across from Disneyland is the California Adventure theme park, which is suggested for older children and adults, since most rides there require a certain height. You can buy a Park-Hopper ticket and visit both parks in the same day (more than once if you like).

, Grab a couple of park maps at the entrance. These will prove invaluable as you navigate through the park. (If you forget to get a map at the entrance, they're available in other locations.) The map will help you find your way to Disneyland's most popular rides, including the Matterhorn, Space Mountain, Splash Mountain, Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage, and Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. These attractions are spread out through the park, and it may be a good idea to ride on them early in the day before the lines get really long. (That's where the map comes in handy, allowing you to find those rides quickly and systematically rather than wasting time wandering haphazardly through the park.) Most of the popular rides permit use of FASTPASSES. These will help you avoid long waits in line, but you need to be pretty organized to make full use of them. Whether you use FASTPASSES or not, the earlier in the day you make it to the most popular rides, the shorter (and less frustrating) the lines will be. The one exception is after the evening fireworks.(More on that later.)

, If you don't want to do a lot of walking or if you have younger children with you, there are many modes of transportation you can use to get around the park faster. One of them is the Disneyland Railroad. This steam-powered train travels around the perimeter of the park, stopping at stations in or near each of the park's main sections. It also passes through the Primeval World diorama, a special hit with dinosaur-loving youngsters. There are other public conveyances, particularly the buses, trolleys and horse-drawn wagons traversing Main Street.

, Disneyland offers a wide variety of places to eat. Try to have lunch before noon because after that, hordes of hungry people will descend on every restaurant, cafe and snack wagon. As for the evening meal, eat before six because the dinner hour can also be very crowded. If you're just looking for a small snack, there are food stands located throughout the park offering popcorn, cotton candy, french fries and lots more.

, You'll find it hard to leave Disneyland without buying a few souvenirs. You'll notice many of the same items in different stores, so if you missed something you liked in Adventureland, you can just buy it later on Main Street. In fact, it's a good idea to buy your souvenirs at the end of the day while leaving the park via Main Street so you don't have to lug them around all day. Main Street has a lot of brand-name stores with everything from hats and clothing to jewelry and toys. If you're looking for an item related to a specific attraction, try the shops nearest that attraction. For example, if you're looking for a Captain Jack Sparrow pirate hat, try looking in a shop near the Pirates of the Caribbean ride in New Orleans Square. Throughout the park you'll find shops that carry sundries such as camera batteries, sunscreen and over-the-counter medications.

, While Disneyland is a safe place for the whole family, a few common-sense precautions are in order. When you first enter the park, choose a meeting spot for your whole party to re-assemble in the event of separation. Make sure any children in your group know how to find that meeting place. Since the park is big, it's not hard to get a bit lost. You can always ask a park employee (including the Disney characters) for help in getting your bearings. One especially tricky time is right after the Fantastic Fireworks show in the evening. Many folks will be heading for the exit, and it may feel a little like a stampede. This is a good time to secure your kids and stand aside. Or just go on a ride and let the crowds move out of the park before you do the same. Of course, you'll want to keep an eye on your younger kids all day long; don't let them go anywhere alone, whether it's bathrooms, shops or rides. It's really not hard to get lost even if you're in a big party. This is particularly true after the fireworks when so many people leave at once.

, This may be the best part of the whole day! The hour-long show takes place at the Great Rivers of America in New Orleans Square and is designed so that you can sit anywhere and still have a great view. The show usually starts at 8 PM and ends at 9. Many people grab seats at the last minute, but that's not recommended. You'll have to climb over people and squeeze into tight spots if you do. Grab a seat before 7:30 PM. If you wait too long you may find yourself standing for the whole performance. A good spot to see the show is right across from the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, which will put you right in front of the action. If you have children in strollers, the strollers must be folded down by 8 PM so other guests can see the show. Remember to bring picnic blankets, quilts and small pillows, as it may get chilly at night, and you may want to avoid sitting on the ground. (You can store these items during the day in public lockers on Main Street.)

, After the first Fantastic Fireworks show, which ends at 9 PM, most guests will be leaving (the tidal wave of people mentioned earlier). Instead of joining them in the slow walk (and drive) away from the park, stick around. Disneyland at night is really fun, mainly because the lines are shorter! This is your chance to go on the rides you missed or want to ride again. Keep in mind, however, that most restaurants and shops close by 9 PM, so do your eating and shopping before then. If you go to Disneyland during the fall, winter or early spring, make sure to bring warm clothing if you're planning to spend the evening, as the weather will be chilly. If you still have shopping to do, head for Main Street's brand-name stores, which will be open until the park closes. Also, if you're not ready for the day to end (and you have Park-Hopper tickets), head next door to California Adventure for more fun. There are also plenty of places to shop, eat and be entertained in the nearby Downtown Disney district.

View as many on-ride videos exist on YouTube already.,
Make sure to denote the average length of time it takes the user to travel from the entrance to the exit points, which will be different depending on how far from the entrance doors the ride starts from and stops at.

",How to Get a Disney Park (On‐Ride) Video From a Different Perspective (for YouTube)," From plain-regular rides with over the shoulder viewpoints (and for those dark rides with night vision turned on), and many other differences, they all exist some place on the site. Try to get a feel for what's already out there, so your video won't repeat the same information from the same viewpoint as that of all others videos.;
,,


Sometimes they can also be called a POV perspective. If you should see this version, get to know that this is the type you are looking for.

, Some of the Disney rides have high backs where you can't film out back of you, meanwhile others are open air towards your back. Look into taking videos from lap-level as well as other differences, that can make your video unique. Put a different ""spin"" on the perspective, that other videos existent on the site yet don't contain.


In essence, It's a Small World or the classic Pirates of the Caribbean ride is open air because it doesn't have something that will block the camera's view in the back, meaning you can take videos looking out back of your point of view. However, the Haunted Mansion has a high back, meaning it won't show anything out back of your current point of view and all the viewer would see is the back of the ride vehicle and nothing else.

, It's always best to keep the voice as low as possible, to ensure that the viewer gets the correct relationship out of it from the narration.

, However, if all you have is a DVD-creation type, make sure it's got enough track space to fit the complete ride on it (which you should have already obtained the time-restriction information from the previewed movies before.

You need to think about a number of different factors, including how much money your parents make and what their schedules are like. Understanding your family’s resources will make it much easier to develop a strong case for going to Disney World. It would probably be awkward asking your parents how much money they make, so try to subtly ask them. Ask them how much money they make in a month and then multiply that by twelve.;
, It is important to understand when your family might be able to visit Disney world. You will need to figure out your parents’ work schedules and determine the best time to plan your trip. Ask your parents how much vacation time they get from their work and then calculate a time that would work for everyone. Find a time that works and make sure there are no conflicts. Find a time that does not conflict with any other family events like weddings or birthdays. It is unlikely that your parents would skip a family gathering over a trip to Disney World.

, Go online and try to figure out how much a trip to Disney World would cost. Visit the Disney World website and calculate how much it would cost to book a trip through them. You can also use other websites, like Hotels.com and Priceline, to find places that might be cheaper. Having a rough budget will make it easier for you to sell the trip to your parents. How much will it cost for everyone to travel there?
How much will hotel rooms for everyone cost?
How much will it cost to feed everyone each day?
What is the entrance fee for Disney World and how much will that cost your family?
Be sure that you do not actually book a trip to Disney World. Your parents will be very upset and it will likely end your efforts to go there.

, There are ways to visit Disney World that are cheaper than others. You can stay at off-site hotels that are much cheaper than those at the resort. Try to find cheap flights to Orlando and plan out meals that are not expensive. Planning a budget trip will likely impress your parents and make them more inclined to say yes to the trip.Be sure to buy your Disney World tickets before you get to the park. They are much cheaper if you buy them in advance.
Look for discounted tickets online. There are many ways to buy cheap Disney World tickets.

, Lay out all of the reasons why you think your family should visit Disney World. Be specific about what attractions you want to see while you are in Orlando. Try to think about reasons for going that your parents might approve of. If you are honest with your parents about why you want to go they will be more likely to see your point of view. Think about any reasons, besides the attractions, for why you want to visit Disney World. Do you want to spend more time with your family? Include that in your list.
Are your siblings interested in going to Disney World as well? Include why that might want to go.
Does your family have a special attachment to a certain Disney character or film? If so, explain how important seeing a character or an attraction related to the film will be for your family.

, Mentally prepare yourself for your parents’ response and understand that there is a strong likelihood that they will say no. Disney World is extremely expense, even if you take the trip on the cheap, and their initial reaction will likely be negative. Do not let this discourage you, be positive and sell you argument positively.

, In the time before you decide to talk to your parents about going to Disney World, be on your absolute best behavior. Do all of your chores, get good grades, and be nice to your siblings. Do extra work around the house by helping out your parents with things like mowing the lawn and shoveling snow. When it comes time to ask about going to Disney World you want to be in your parents’ good graces. This will make them more likely to see your proposal favorably. This strategy will likely take some time. Start helping out more months before you ask. If you are only on your best behavior for one day before you talk to your parents, it is unlikely that they will be much influenced.
Ask your parents how you can help out more around the house or what chores you can perform.

, Try to indirectly let your parents know that you want to go to Disney World. Subtlety can be an excellent way to get your parents thinking about the trip. Try wearing a Disney shirt once a week or watch Disney cartoons more regularly. Play your favorite Disney music and quote lines from your favorite films. This will not only get the idea in your parents’ heads, but it will also make it easier to pitch your idea to them because they will already be thinking about it.


You could also drop little comments like, “It sure would be nice to see Goofy in person” or “I wonder what it would be like to be in the Jungle Book.”
Try not to overdo the Disney stuff. You do not want to burn out your parents on it.

, Think about your parents’ schedule and find a time that they will be in a good mood to hear your vacation pitch. Catching your parents in a good mood will be key to getting them onboard with your trip. Avoid times when your parents are tired or stressed. Instead ask them when they are relaxed and in a good mood. Wait until after the next major holiday to ask your parents about the trip. They may surprise you with a trip and you will not have to ask them for one.
Avoid asking them immediately before or after they get home from work. They will likely be tired and stressed out.
Try asking them on the weekend when they will be relaxing and more open to your suggestion.

, If you want your parents to take your proposal seriously, you need to be polite when you talk to them. Do not be pushy or demanding about going on the trip. If you throw a fit and act kind of bratty it is unlikely that your parents are going to say yes. Be on your absolute best behavior when proposing you Disney World trip. Try saying things like, “can we please go to Disney World” and “I would be very grateful if we visited Disney World.”
Remember the old saying that “You can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.”

, Lay out the list of reasons why you want to go to Disney World. Explain what attractions you are really interested in and why you think the family should take the trip. Be specific and try to highlight things that will appeal to the whole family and not just you. Although there are some things you are excited to see, you need to remember that this is a family trip and needs to appeal to everyone.If you have them, bring in your siblings to help you sell the trip. There people supporting the trip the better.
Play to their sentimentality and talk about the priceless memories that you can make as a family.
Say something like, “it has always been my dream to see Mickey Mouse and Goofy” or that you think “a family vacation would help you create memories that you would have for the rest of your life.”

, Demonstrate to your parents that you are responsible by laying out the research you conducted on how much a trip might cost. It does not have to be an exact budget but have something prepared that will give your parents an idea of what the expenses are of going to Disney World. Be sure to have an estimate of all of the expenses, including travel, hotel, food, and tickets.

, Point out attractions at Disney World that might appeal to your parents’ interests. If one of your parents is a sports fan, talk about the ESPN Wide World of Sports. Emphasize that there is Disney childcare if they would like a night to themselves. Find something to hook your parents and bring it up.Figure out your parents interests before you propose the trip.
If your parents like horses, you propose a trip to Disney World by saying something like, “I know that you love horses, and guess what!? At Disney World, you can ride horses on the beach!”

, Offer to do more chores or improve your grades if they take you on a trip to Disney World. Your parents might more open to taking a trip to Disney World if they know that you are willing to work for it. Find out if there is something that your parents would really like you to do for the trip, and agree to do it.You can also try to do better in school. This might convince your parents that you deserve to go to Disney World.
If you have not been doing well in school, you can tell your parents that you will try “especially hard” for a trip to Disney World.

, It is unlikely that your parents will say yes to your proposal right away. They are going to need some time to decide whether or not they have the time and money for a trip to Disney World. Do not constantly pester your parents about their decision. If they get annoyed with you it will be easier for them to say no.Mark a date on your calendar that is a few weeks to a month after you talk to them and do not revisit the subject until then.
Keep being on your best behavior in the meantime. It’s only going to help your cause.

, If your parents shoot down your proposal try to stay calm and not get too emotional. Although it is extremely disappointing, it’s important to not get upset. Talk with your parents about why they said no and try to see things from their point of view. This will help you deal with the disappointment and move on.Keeping clam will tell your parents that you are mature enough for a trip like this in the future.

, Just because you are not going to Disney World does not mean you should quit doing well at school and at home. You need to understand that you are playing the long game and, by being good, you are setting yourself up for a future trip. Keep demonstrating how mature you are and your parents will reward you.Keep doing well in school. You might be able to go to Disney World as part of a school trip.

, If you get upset about your parents shooting you down, it might be tempting to lash out against them and your siblings. Resist the urge to be mean to your parents and other family members. This will only show them that you are not mature enough for a trip to Disney World and shut down the possibility of a future trip.


If you are mad about your parents’ decision, talk to them about it. It is important to remember that your parents are not trying to be mean. They just want to do what is best for your family.

, If your strategy to convince your parents fails, try another one. If you only tried to sell them on cool attractions, mention things that they might like next time. Keep thinking of new ways to sell them on Disney World.Be persistent but do not bug your parents. If they get annoyed with your constant pestering they will keep saying no.

, One of life’s many constants is disappointment and it is important that you learn how to deal with it. If your parents tell you that you are not going to Disney World, you need to accept that fact. Think about why you wanted to go to Disney World and what that means. You might find that you never really wanted to go to Disney World in the first place.Maybe your parents will take you to Six Flags instead!

Look at the parks from an educational standpoint.,
Look at the parks from a ""fun-like"" perspective.,
Try to compare the crowds.,
Look for excitement in roller coasters in some parks more than others.,
Look at the setup of each park.,
Look towards the travel arrangements between the Ticket and Transportation Center (parking lot for the Magic Kingdom) and the Magic Kingdom itself to be a comparison.,
Look for kid-like bright cheery colors at the entrance to Magic Kingdom, whereas all the others tend to be less bright and more adult-like in taste.

,
Look towards the history of the parks.,
Look for classic theme rides to exist at the Magic Kingdom.,
Think in terms of parades.,
Look towards the differences in the lot names of each theme park.,
Don't think that by going to any one park the parking info will be any cheaper.",How to Compare Disney World Theme Parks," While both Epcot is educating the viewer with real-life situations and about a person's normal environment, both Disney's Hollywood Studios and Animal Kingdom both have standpoints much the same (though one is focused on the movies and the other on animals). The Magic Kingdom is focused on educational views, but in a fantasy-faire way.;
, While Magic Kingdom tends to be more fun than any of the other parks for those willing to stand the crowds, other parks can have just the same amount of fun if you know where (good clean) ""fun"" exists.

, While Early Magic Hours takes people away from certain parks when Disney expects to see massive hordes of people, it draws that out on other parks. Crowds will be focused more around the younger set at both Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom and the older crowds at Disney's Hollywood Studios and Epcot.

, While each park (except Epcot) has at least one, the park with the most thrill in their roller coaster is Space Mountain in the Magic Kingdom (though some people may beg to differ). Reports have been shown throughout websites and in many books including the Unofficial Guides books that Space Mountain trumps the others any day of the year (and in some can sometimes be too much excitement).

, While Epcot is set up in two moon-like circles around two famous circular shapes (World Showcase Lagoon and the Epcot(Spaceship Earth) ball), each of the other 3 theme parks have only one real central locale and has several lands traveling around the hub location.

, None of the others have this setup; once you're through the gates, the whole park is at your fingertips just by walking (no alternate forms are needed to get from the parking lot and entrance to the park itself.

,, While the Magic Kingdom is by far the oldest(first opened in 1971), Animal Kingdom (opened in 1998) is by far the youngest of the 4 parks.

, Between the Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean and it's a small world and the Enchanted Tiki Room, there's no way to resist not going to this park on any Disney World vacation.

, While at any given time and day parades could be yanked from the lineup, the two theme parks that don't have parades include Epcot and Animal Kingdom (one was the result of the parade being retired as of earlier 2014 and the other being the result of a retiring and non-replacement in the early 2000s). Most other parks contain at least 1 parade showing, if not 2 per day.

, Each theme park is different, but each theme park's lots are based on what the visitor is intending to see.

, No matter what park you use, you still have to pay the same admission fee. However, if you exit one parking lot and try to reenter another on the same day, keep your ticket and show it to the nice parking lot attendant and they'll gladly admit you to the parking lots with no additional charge (show your parking lot ticket and you'll be scott free to get in to two different parks on the same day).

,, There are a few really good sites out there that can give you a great comparison to differentiate between the two parks.

,,, Disneyland is on the West Coast (in Anaheim, CA) and Walt Disney World is on the East Coast (in Lake Buena Vista, FL (which is near Orlando, FL)).

, Disneyland is comprised of 2 main theme parks and a large entertainment district; meanwhile Walt Disney World is comprised of 4 theme parks and a large entertainment district.

, While Disneyland has its users park in one of several parking garages, Walt Disney World would rather have cars spread out more into several lots that span a long distance (and if need be, they have a tram to bring paying guests to the entrance gates to the park).

, The distance between the theme parks at Disneyland in California is a short walking path away (you exit one gate and you can plainly see the other gate in front of you). Meanwhile, Walt Disney World isn't set up that way. If you aren't renting a car or can't access the Walt Disney World Monorail system for some reason, the parks are a pretty far distance away and you'll need to find another way to get from one park to another.

, In Disneyland, you have 3 major Disney-owned & operated hotels staffed nearby the parks. In Walt Disney World, there are countless Disney-owned and operated hotels ready to assist you during your stay/visit., the minute they see the difference.

, Meanwhile, although most of Walt Disney World has nighttime shows, Animal Kingdom has to be exempt as the animals don't want to get scared at these shows so they don't air ones.

, Looking through each set and recognizing that at the end of most of the attractions will often yield a shopping establishment, and in terms of food establishments, they are in the parks too.

Not everything will interest everyone, so by being specific, you can potentially cut down the costs and have a more focused visit. Most of all, it will make it easier to take advantage of specific packages if you plan out what you want to do in advance.


Take some time to think about what kind of activities you want to do during your trip, based on the ages and preferences of everyone in your group. The ticket options are explained below under ""Purchasing Discounted or Good Deal Park Tickets.""
If you want to travel cheaply to Disney World, you may have to miss out on certain activities, so prioritize the different activities into categories like “Must Do,” “Maybe,” “Not Interested,” etc.
You can learn all about the different parks and activities at http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/parks/ and http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/destinations/.;
, One of the nicest ways to travel, especially to the Disney parks, is using a ‘package’ vacation. This means that airfare/travel, hotel, food, and park tickets are all included in one package for purchase. While this makes things easier for convenience’ sake, it doesn’t look so good on your wallet. Unfortunately, because so many items are being grouped together, most packages are typically more expensive than each of the individual components are. So what’s the solution?


Only book a package if you are certain the total is the same as the sum of all the parts.
Consider nixing the complete package, and buying smaller packages to combine together. For example, get an airfare/hotel package combined with park tickets/food package.
Create your own package by buying everything individually, and organizing each of the parts for ultimate ease of use.

, Just like prices for airfare, hotels, and tickets individually, the longer you wait the more expensive they become. If you’re searching for a package, you’ll need to start looking several months (i.e, at least 6 months) prior to when you plan to go on your trip. This will allow you to spend necessary time hunting down the cheapest package, and you’ll be looking when the packages are typically at their cheapest.


There are two ends of the spectrum: if you plan too far in advance (close to a year or more) or too soon before your trip (a month or less) you’ll be unlikely to get a decent price on any package.
Keep in mind that you can start planning early, just to compare prices and see what’s available. You should wait to purchase anything until 4-6 months before your trip, though.

, Although your first impulse might be to head to the Disney World website, you’ll be falling into the typical tourist trap and end up paying a lot more money. Because of the ease of finding a package through the Disney website, they are able to increase prices on most all of the items sold, including packages to the parks. Avoid going straight to Disney’s website, and instead look for package deals on other locations.


Look at the price that Disney offers for certain packages, so you have a price point to act as a comparison on other sites.
Search as many other sites that offer Disney packages as you’re able, in order to increase your chances of finding a good deal.

, Although it’s unlikely you’ll find a Disney package that has 1-star hotels and cheap food, you may need to consider minimizing your costs in other fashions. Decide what you’re willing to cut out of your budget, or what you can restrict your spending on. Food, for example, can be brought into the park instead of purchased. You can also choose to walk or take public transportation, rather than an expensive hotel/park shuttle. Break down everything you intend to spend money on, and then decide what you can cut from the list.


Souvenirs may seem like a necessary keepsake, but are highly overpriced and will rack up fast. Decide to only get ‘mouse ears’ or something of the sort, so that you don’t end up wasting money on things you won’t use in a few weeks.
Only purchase food that you need, rather than buying whatever sweet treat looks good. This will save you money, and your body won’t be dragging as much at the end of the day.
If you’re willing to simplify your hotel situation, consider getting a single or double room and having everyone share beds. Or, you can go extreme and have a single bed and everyone else in sleeping bags on the floor., Throughout the year, the Disney parks have special offers on ticket, hotel, and food prices inside Disney World. Generally, different offers can save you money on lodging, food, activities, and park tickets. Go to http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/special-offers/ to view a list of the special offers currently available.


Special offers can be especially useful if you're a member of the U.S. military, as many of the offers are tailored toward this group.

, By far the cheapest way to get to Disney World is to drive. Although this might not be a feasible option if you live on the West Coast. if you live in the South or on the East Coast you should definitely try to make a road-trip to the theme park. Driving will save you several hundred dollars on airfare - especially if more than two people are traveling with you. Plus, once you get to the parks you’ll be able to use your own car as transportation, rather than having to hire a shuttle to drive you around everywhere. Calculate the number of hours you’ll have to drive, and split that up into the number of days it would take to get to Disney World.


Because driving can conceivably take 2-3 days, you’ll want to try to stay at budget hotels or campsites along the way.
If you’re bringing a large family, prepare for the road trip by coming up with games and activities to do along the way.

, If you’re not able or willing to drive to Disneyland, you’ll have to fly there instead. It is unlikely you’ll be able to find a cheap Disney World package that includes hotel rooms for a decent rate, but you can get around this by booking a different hotel combined with your airfare. Many websites will significantly discount the combined cost of your flights and hotel rooms if you book them at the same time. Therefore, do a bit of research on hotels in the area, and see if you can combine them with your airfare at purchase.


Some search engines will allow you to ‘name a price’ for a hotel+flight, and present you with what’s available.
Keep in mind that whenever possible, go for the cheapest hotel and airfare on the market.

, There are many tricks to the trade when it comes to booking flights, and among the most beneficial is simply knowing the right time to book. Flying to a destination is always the least expensive from Monday through Thursday, and especially on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Air carriers typically have deals on flights on Tuesday afternoons, so plan on purchasing your flight on a Tuesday after 2:00PM. Additionally, you’ll get the best price on your plane flight if you book at least three months in advance, but no longer than nine months in advance.


Always search multiple search engines for the best deals on airfare. You can also go directly to an air carrier’s website for specific deals on only their flights.
Fly out of neighboring airports if there is a cheaper flight departing from there, as you’ll save money even if you have to drive a bit to get there.

, One great way to save money on your trip is to go during the down season for Disney World. The Disney World website offers different hotel rates depending on the time of year, and this can help you save money if you're willing to go during down periods. (It can also reduce the amount of time you have to spend waiting in line once you're inside the parks.) You can also save money on flights by flying during down periods.


The Disney World website offers two different “Value Seasons” that have greatly reduced rates for hotels. The first lasts from early January to mid-February, and the second one lasts from early August to late September.
To find one example of the savings you can realize from traveling during non-peak seasons, check out the difference in cost between a standard room at Disney’s All-Star Movie Resort per night during Value Season, compared with the cost per night during Peak Season. You may find the difference to be considerable.

, Disney allows you to search for available rooms at all of the Walt Disney World Resort hotels for the dates of your stay. Because you’ll be staying at a hotel inside the park, you can cut down the price of travel to/from and combine your room with food vouchers for a reduced rate. The hotels vary by price, but you can filter your search to prefer the cheaper options.


To do this, go to http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/ and then click on the link that says, “Try the Vacation Package Guide”. On the Vacation Package Guide page, you will see four different categories (Vacation Pace, Hotel Experience, Dining Style, Things to Do) with options to choose from. To filter for cheaper hotels, drag the tab for Hotel Experience over to “Basic” (as opposed to “Luxurious”).
You can also use the “Budget” tab to set your budget for the entire trip to the low end of the spectrum. This will cause Disney to find cheaper options for all of the different categories.
Alternatively, you can find the cheaper options on the Disney website by clicking “Places to Stay” at the top of the homepage and then selecting “Disney Value Resort Hotels” on the next page. This will take you to a list of the cheapest Disney hotels, and offers a “Compare” feature so that you can view them side-by-side.

, It is almost guaranteed that you will find cheaper rooms at hotels outside the park than you will inside. If the atmosphere of the park hotel isn’t a primary goal, you should try searching for local hotels that will have discounted prices. Look for hotels that are close enough to the park that you don’t end up using the money you saved on transportation expenses. Try searching in these areas:


Disney Main gate - Celebration
West Disney Area
Sea World - Int’l Drive - Convention Center
Downtown Disney - Lake Buena Vista, The Disney World Resort includes four different parks, as well as two water parks. With all of these different choices, you'll need to be sure of exactly what you're buying when you purchase your tickets. The following explanations may be of help:



The Magic Your Way Base Ticket: This is the standard, cheapest option. This ticket type allows you entry into one of the four theme parks per day (water parks not included). With this ticket, you can leave the park and return on the same day, but you must go back to the same park.

The Park Hopper: This option adds a premium to the cost of your ticket, but allows you to go back and forth between the different theme parks each day.

The Water Park Fun & More: This option gives you access to the Disney water parks, as well as other entertainment such as Disney’s Oak Trail Golf Course, ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex, and miniature golf courses. The number of entries to these parks that you can make depends on the length of your ticket. For example, a 1-day ticket gives you two entries, while a 5-day ticket gives you five.

The No Expiration: This option means that your tickets do not expire, so if you have extra days on your ticket that you do not use, you can come back at some point in the future and use them. Normally, these tickets expire 14 days after they are first used.

, If you're seeking the cheapest option, you definitely want to choose the Base Ticket. If you do this, you will only be able to enter one of the parks each day, so it is important to plan in advance so that you can see everything you want to see during your trip. Spend some time researching the different parks and plan your trip based on the preferences of the different members of your group.


Note that you can upgrade your tickets at any time during your stay, but you will be charged extra.

, The per day cost of your ticket decreases sharply the longer you stay. The greatest savings occurs with the 4-day ticket, which costs only $14 more than the 3-day ticket. Buying the 4-day ticket is a great way to get a whole extra day out of your trip without adding much in park admission costs.

, Some websites offer tickets at a slightly discounted rate from the Disney website. A good place to start looking for these is http://tickets.orlandovacation.com/. If you buy tickets on a site other than the Disney site, make sure that they are the correct tickets that you mean to buy, and that they are indeed cheaper than the ones available through Disney. However, do not purchase pre-bought tickets off of websites such as Craigslist.com, as these won’t work when you try to enter the park; the information on the ticket must match your personal ID info.You can receive a discount on your ticket if you are a Florida resident.
There are several special programs that allow you to volunteer for a day at a local community center, in exchange for a free basic ticket into the park. Do a bit of research to see if you qualify.

, Although you can’t bring in coolers, your best bet on saving money throughout the day is to eat your own food. Pack sandwiches and snacks that you can munch on during your time in the park, so that even if you don’t solely eat the food you bring, you won’t be so reliant on purchasing food. It is also good to bring plenty of your own water and liquids, as keeping hydrated will keep you less hungry, and purchasing liquids inside the park can be quite expensive.


Avoid buying food throughout the day if you’re able, especially sugary snacks that will just leave you feeling more hungry afterwards.
Set a budget for snacks so that you are forced to avoid spending.

, Adding a dining plan to your vacation package is a great way to save money on food if you book your vacation through the official Disney site. Doing so can save you up to 20 percent on food over the course of your stay. To find the cheapest options, go to the Vacation Package Guide page. Adjust the “Dining Style” dial to “Counter Service” to filter for the cheaper dining packages. You can also learn all about the available meal plans at http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/planning-guides/in-depth-advice/disney-dining-plan/.


Keep in mind that certain items, including alcoholic beverages, are not included in the cost of any dining plan that you purchase.

, Yes, four sets of Mickey Mouse ears might sound like fun now, but if you’re really trying to budget you’ll need to cut out spending on everything except for what you absolutely need. Of course, it’s totally reasonable to have a budget set aside for certain ‘fun’ things inside the park, but just know how much you’re willing to spend before you start spending. It’s easy to feel like something is worth buying in the moment, but later on it’s likely that you’ll regret your spur of the moment purchase.


Look for free pins and items around the park that you can keep as souvenirs. A park map that you mark off along the way may work nicely.
Make sure to discuss your budget with your family as best you can prior to entering the park, so as to avoid any possible meltdowns/temper tantrums."

Make hotel reservations. You can begin booking your hotel room 500 days in advance if you call Disney directly. However, the hotel prices will likely be more accurate a year in advance, when there is still plenty of available space.
Make restaurant reservations. You can begin reserving your seats at the sit-down restaurants 180 days before your arrival in Walt Disney World. Consider choosing one of Disney's dining plans to ensure three meals per day at a set price.
Make FastPass reservations. You can begin reserving FastPass tickets 60 days before your arrival. Each guest is allowed three passes per day at each park.
Purchase tickets. Prices are available online beginning in August of the year prior to the year you want to visit Disney World. At that point, the prices are unlikely to vary, and there is no discount for purchasing your tickets early. You can purchase them in the park on the day you visit, if you wish, though the lines can be taxing.;
, Many people like the familiarity of enjoying Christmas in the comfort of their own homes, but just because you are going to be in a strange place doesn't mean you have to forgo your long-standing traditions. Bring a small tree to place in your hotel room; if you don't have room to pack one, bring or draw pictures. Bring Christmas lights that you might hang outside your house to string along the curtain rod or across the dresser in your hotel room. Bring Christmas movies or books that you might use at home to get in the spirit.

, Items purchased from these places can be wrapped and brought home to enjoy or used during your stay.


Disney's Day's of Christmas is a store in the Marketplace area of Downtown Disney. It is open year-round, but special offers tend to pop around around the holidays. Here, you can purchase ornaments, stockings, tree toppers, tree skirts, and other Christmas collectibles and gifts.
Ye Olde Christmas Shoppe is located in Liberty Square of the Magic Kingdom park. Here, you can purchase toys, figurines, and character-themed Christmas items, such as stockings and ornaments.

, Walt Disney World offers dozens of top-rate restaurants to choose from, and as long as you make your reservations in plenty of time, you can enjoy a quality meal of your choice on Christmas Day.

, These events include but are not limited to:


Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party requires a separate admission ticket; it is recommended that you purchase this ticket as early as possible, because capacity is limited and space fills up quickly. The party is held in the Magic Kingdom park on select nights in November and December, and it includes something fun for all ages, like the lighting of the Cinderella castle, character dance shows/parties, a parade and ""snowfall"" on Main Street, U.S.A., complimentary snacks, and opportunities to meet Disney characters.
Holidays Around the World is a popular event that fills up quickly; it is recommended that you purchase the Candlelight Dinner Package (guaranteed seating and an ideal viewing spot for the fireworks). Otherwise, attendance is first come, first served. The event is held in the Epcot Center on select nights in November and December. This festival celebrates holiday traditions from the far reaches of the globe, and it includes live entertainment in the form of a choir and 50-piece orchestra, a biblical account told by a guest celebrity narrator, and lavish decorations throughout the park.

For those with difficulty hearing, an ASL interpreter will tell the story as well, so everyone can enjoy this traditional Disney festival.


IllumiNations: Reflections of Earth is a fireworks show that can be viewed from anywhere in the Epcot Center on select nights in December, though areas with a clear view of the World Showcase Lagoon are ideal, since this is where the show begins. It is helpful to establish a viewing place well before 9:00 PM (21:00), when the show begins, as the good places to sit are typically occupied by that time. The show is held outdoors, so availability is subject to inclement weather. It is a fire and water show, complete with music, dessert, and a luminescent globe that floats in the World Showcase Lagoon. IllumiNations is a truly magical experience, not to be missed.
The Osborne Family Spectacle of Dancing Lights is included in the standard admission ticket to Disney's Hollywood Studios park and transpires on select dates in December that will become available as the season approaches. This event began with one family in Arkansas that used to put on an annual display of elaborate Christmas lights, a gesture that has since been extended to all of Walt Disney World's guests. See millions of colored lights twinkling and flashing in time to holiday music. Stand in the Streets of America area of the park to get the ideal view of this spectacular show.

Consider purchasing Mickey ear hats that flash in synchronization with the lights show.



, During the holiday season, each ""country"" will feature music, seasonal food, celebrations, and decorations specific to that nation's interpretation of Christmas. For example, the United States of America station will tell the tale of Mr. and Mrs. Santa Claus that many American children are familiar with, while the story of the Daruma doll and other Japanese New Year traditions can be heard in Japan.

, This eating and shopping center is buzzing with nightlife around Christmas. You can shop for gifts and souvenirs in specialty shops, listen to carolers and street performers, enjoy seasonal cuisine, visit Santa and other characters, dance at a live holiday dance party, and see the enormous Christmas tree.

, While weekly services are not held on Disney property, on Christmas and Easter, a Catholic Mass and Protestant service are held in the Fantasia Ballroom at Walt Disney's Contemporary Resort. Dates and times are subject to change, but there are typically two services on Christmas Eve and three on Christmas Day (two in the morning and one in the evening). If none of those times are accommodating, consider churches near Disney property .

Call the Disney Parks Corporation to find out when the taping of the Christmas Day Parade will be held.,Realize that the parade will tend to run down Main Street USA in both parks, so be aware so you don't fight the crowds for a great spot on the benches nearby the parade later.,
Be prepared for a long wait as you help create the mood that will reflect the taping.,
Realize that there are two parts to both events.,
Dress to act the part as if it was taped live on Christmas.,
Realize that although the taping is free to additional fees, the only other fee is the park fee which you should have thought about before entering the park that day.

,
Position yourself someplace in the crowds to have your voice ""heard"" as one of the many people that will act and respond to what the on-stage producers or in the parade would like parade viewers to react to.

",How to Attend the Taping of the Disney Park's Christmas Day Parade," Make sure you don't call any sooner (to either park) no sooner than October 1st. For Walt Disney World guests, you can dial (407) 939-5277, or for Disneyland (CA) you may end up calling 1- (714) 781-INFOor contact either park by the web form located on the Walt Disney World website or the Disneyland website respectively. These two places are very verifiable sources of information to help you plan around the date in which to visit the park.


Although the dates vary by calendar year and park location and a load of other factors, plan to visit the Disney Parks (especially the Magic Kingdom) sometime between the very first Friday in November (for Disneyland audiences) and on the weekend that falls nine days after Thanksgiving, roughly the last weekend in November or first week of December (for the Magic Kingdom in Walt Disney World audiences ).
Make sure that Disneyland and Walt Disney World employees don't convince you that this event is the same regular parade as the nighttime and afternoon parades that air daily on the same parade route.;
,, It can take up to 2 1/2 to 3 hours to tape this program, as they will allot for a ""dry practice run"" followed by a taping of just the audio track followed by the taping of the video track of the activities., The stage appearance sometimes will be taped before the parade, which will be spread out over several tries and retries and, by itself, can last no shorter than two hours by itself., Go with the flow. Wear a red Santa cap (with or without a bell). But make sure you look casual, and the remainder of your clothes won't make you stand out from any of the other guests in the area of the park.

Consider the following factors:

Cost of construction.






Access to buildings and or roads.

Crosswind strip if crosswinds are common in your area.






Safe, barrier free approaches, even if strip will never be used at night.;

Perform a similar pattern.,
Warm up the rudders.,
Make sure that you keep the nose down or the horizon line around 3/4 up the windshield, this should put you close to your best gliding ratio, and will prevent you to enter into a spin.

,
Approach the runway always aligned into the center line, which will give you the maximum separation available from the edge of the runway or obstacles within it.

,
Once you get over the numbers, pull the power to idle, and barely pull the stick back to compensate for the loss of power, glide down the runway until you are maybe around 2 or 3 feet (0.6 or 0.9 m) above the runway, do not let the airplane touch the ground, by pulling backwards, use the ground effect to help you glide, eventually you should have the stick all the way by your stomach, without being able to pull more, when that happens, you should softly fall into a shallow stall, with the three tires on the ground (three point landing).,
Again, the most important thing is to perform a good Pattern, we have an extra thing to worry about... wind direction and speed.,
This means that you will come into final approach either looking through the side window (Left or right)so let's say that your runway is 36 but the wind direction is 030 @ 15 mph (24 km/h).,
You will need to find the exact amount of turn and rudder you will need in order to maintain heading 360 without being blown away to your left.

,
Remember to maintain the nose down to maintain airspeed.

,
Once over the numbers, power to idle and pull slightly backwards.,
As the left wheel starts to come down, input right aileron accordingly so you keep the airplane from flipping.

,
Once on taxiing, make sure that you keep elevator input with the stick all the way back when Upwind, so the tail wheel stays on the ground, and when turning make sure the stick is turned INTO the wind.",How to Land a Taildragger," Landing the aircraft begins with a good landing pattern. If we are talking about an aircraft, such as a Super Decathlon, J3 Cub etc... An aircraft with an approach speed around the 50 mph (80 km/h) (Please note it is a round number). Always perform a pattern as similar as the last one. (3/4 of a mile from the airport is always a safe distance)

, After performing a good downwind - base - and turn to final approach, a great idea is to ""Warm up the Rudders"" which means deflect the rudders left and right, keep inputting small left and right inputs and prepare yourself to use them, because YOU WILL!. Let's remember that a tail dragger has the tendency to bring the tail forward, which will happen if you do not use those rudders to prevent it.

IMPORTANT!! Do not look just immediately in front of the airplane, look all the way to the end of the runway, this will give you a much more clear view of what kind of input you have to put into those rudders.

Reserve your room via the MyDisneyExperience website.,
Realize that all rooms are allotted for no more than five people at a time.

,
Park your car in the lot outside the Contemporary Resort, which is just inside the Resort parking gates to the Magic Kingdom parking lot (stay to the right, and show the ticket-giver your confirmation sheet/receipt, and they'll happily waive the price of admission to the resort).,
Open the entrance door to the resort nearest the parking lot you parked in.

,
Turn around the corner.,
Remember that check-in time is no earlier than 3pm, although many people will be successful when they try to get a room before that time, it's not allowed and you shouldn't try.,
Present them a copy of the receipt you should have printed (or at least a copy of the confirmation number to your reservation).,
Let them run the paperwork and hand you the card/keys that will give you the privilege to open your room door (Disney calls these keys the ""Keys to the World"" cards).

,
Let them talk to you about the number you are supposed to call daily to see if the room is ready for your daily visit (Remember, the maids will go in and clean up and straighten up while you are away.)",How to Check in at Disney’s Contemporary Resort," Make sure to count all of your guests. Most websites that aren't affiliated with Disney won't sell you a room here, due to various reasons.


Be careful not to choose the Bay Lake Tower at the Contemporary Resort, as this new complex isn't the same and is much more expensive than it's regular resort, although it is very close by. (Just when you thought the room prices at the Contemporary Resort were too high, the Bay Lake Resort will run you up a super-steep bill!)
The Contemporary Resort is full of adjoining rooms. Upon reservation of the room, you'll need to speak with a Disney World Customer Service agent and mention that you'd like to have adjoining rooms. However, they are only able to supply adjoining rooms under certain conditions.;
,,


Follow the signs that direct you to the Contemporary Resort, after you enter through the Welcome to Walt Disney World (Magic Kingdom) park gates.
There are two lots located at either end of the hotel, one is much bigger than the other.

,, Nearby, you'll see the main office/check in desk. If there's a person standing at the desk for ""Online Check In Services"" try to head to that clerk. Otherwise, head to the person at another register/desk.

, The chances of getting a room on floors few people want to use (nosebleed section of the resort or something entirely different), are much higher then. Don't go there too early, or you won't get in to a room, either.

, However, the more the merrier in Disney's case.

For instance, Disneyland sometimes offers multi-park, multi-day passes that allow the ticket holder to visit different Disney theme parks on different days, and these admission tickets will come at a discounted rate. These are great for families who are on a road trip!;
, Both the American Automobile Association and the Canadian Automobile Association offer discounted Disney tickets and packages for members.


If you're a member, have your card or number ready and either visit the AAA or CAA website, or visit your nearest location to inquire about deals.

, People who live in Florida are entitled to special ticket and pass prices to Disney World. You can see the full selection if discount ticket options in the Disney World site.


Special deals for Floridians often include discounted rates for single day tickets, multi-day passes, and annual passes.
Note that to take advantage of these offers, you will have to prove that you are a resident of Florida.

, Shades of Green is a resort operated for members of the Armed Forces, and they also provide discounted rates for Disney World tickets and packages to military service personnel who have valid IDs. Similarly, Disneyland often provides discounted tickets for military personnel, as does Disney World.

, Residents of the European Union can get great prices on Disney World tickets if they purchase the tickets before traveling to America. To purchase tickets from abroad, visit the Disney World international site to check out ticket prices.

, There are numerous credit card plans and travel reward plans, such as Aeroplanand Air Miles,that periodically allow members to redeem points for discounted admissions to places like Disney World and Disneyland.

, Disney’s YES program is an educational series for kids and youth that offers on-site courses on topics like art, sciences, environmental studies, and leadership. Enrollment includes a discounted ticket price, but the courses are mandatory for kids who sign up.


These programs are typically aimed at elementary, junior, and high school students., There are a few legitimate sites out there that sell real Disney tickets at discounted prices. Not only can you get discounted admission prices for various Disney theme parks (for single and multiple days), but you can also find other special deals and promotions. This includes cheaper admissions for water parks like Typhoon Lagoon, show tickets, cheap admissions for attractions such as Hollywood Studios, entertainment tickets for things like Disney character experiences, and other special features. Some of the more trusted sites are:

, When buying regular or discount tickets for Disney theme parks, read the fine print for additional fees that could alter the price of the ticket. You may find a discount supplier that offers lower ticket prices than anyone else, but the hidden fees could add up and make the final cost more expensive than another provider., The off-season at Disney theme parks is called the value season, but this generally only occurs in January. While ticket prices are likely going to be the same all year round, a trip during value season will mean better hotel rates.Hotels are usually the most expensive portion of a Disney trip, so saving money on accommodations could actually save you even more money than discounted tickets.

, Every now and then, Disney releases special promotions that can be used by anybody, and sites like Mouse Savers compile and list all the current promos that are available.

, Meals are another expensive part of a Disney holiday, but you can save money here by looking for meal coupons and discounts from fan pages and the official Disney park sites.


Alternatively, you can also save money by eating off-site, as theme parks always charge a premium for food purchased within the park.

, Most of the deals offered directly by Disneyland and Disney World involve discounts and special rates on hotels, vacations packages, meals, and show and entertainment tickets.


The promotions offered directly through the official park sites change frequently and are only valid for limited times, so check back often if you're planning a trip in the future.

, These are special offers that are made to current guests of Disney theme parks (meaning, you get the offer while you're still on vacation). The deals are designed to encourage guests to return, so they’ll often provide great deals on bookings and hotels if you book now for a future trip., Disney offers PIN codes that are associated with exclusive offers for people. These PIN codes are often associated with a specific person, but there are sometimes general PIN codes that get sent out that can be redeemed by anyone. The offers usually involve hotel discounts, meal coupons, and ticket upgrades.The only way to be targeted for a PIN promotion is to have a profile with a Disney park, and the more accounts you open and the more profiles you create, the more likely you'll be offered a PIN.
The way Disney chooses to target patrons for PIN promotions is a trade secret, but you may be able to increase your odds by creating multiple accounts, participating in surveys, registering for different programs and groups, requesting DVDs and maps, and being active with your accounts.

Plan the descent in advance.,
Determine the start and end altitudes of the descent path.,
Define the amount of descent.,
Consider the ground speed of the aircraft.,
Apply descent rate.",How to Calculate Aircraft Descent Rate," The higher and faster the aircraft is flying, the further away from the field the descent must be started. The weight of the aircraft also will affect the speed of descent. For example, it takes longer and further to descend a fast and heavy high altitude airliner than it does to descend a slow and light 2-seat private aviation aircraft. Descents can easily begin more than 100 miles (160 km) from the field. It must be ascertained in advance that that runway available is long enough to provide the incoming aircraft with enough roll out distance to come to a safe stop. Runways as short as 2000 feet (600 m) long can be used for private aviation at smaller general aviation airports. Runways for larger passenger jets are typically in the range of 10,000-12,000 feet (3050-3650 m) long.;
, The end altitude of the landing field should be well documented by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The start altitude will be the cruising altitude of the aircraft. All altitudes are referenced to sea level, rather than ground level, so the landing field will rarely have an altitude of 0.

, This is the start altitude of the descent path minus the end altitude of the flight path plus a safety buffer of altitude that will allow the aircraft to properly line up with the landing field. For example, an aircraft with a cruising altitude of 35,000 feet (10,675 m) approaching an airport that is at 1,500 feet (458 m) might choose to descend to 1,000 feet (305 m) above the landing field for final approach. This would make the descent distance 35,000 - (1,500 + 1,000), or 32,500 feet (9913 m).

, This is a combination of the air speed of the aircraft and any head or tail winds that are affecting the aircraft. For example, an aircraft with an air speed of 300 miles per hour (MPH) or 480 kilometers per hour (KPH) would have a ground speed of 250 MPH if flying into a 50 MPH (80 KPH) head wind, and a ground speed of 350 MPH if assisted by a 50 MPH (80 KPH) tail wind.

,

Calculate the starting point of the descent. Normally, the descent rate would define the point at which the descent must be started. Descent rates are usually chosen to be between 333 feet (102 m) per minute and 500 feet (153 m) per minute to give an effective descent without discomforting the passengers due to rising air pressure as the aircraft descends. The descent is left short of the landing field to give room for the aircraft to line up for final approach. For example, an aircraft is at a ground speed of 300 MPH (480 KPH) and an altitude of 35,000 feet (10675 m). The aircraft needs to complete the descent at 2,500 feet (763 m) altitude and 10 miles (16 km) short of the landing field to allow time for the aircraft to line up for final approach. At a chosen descent rate of 500 feet (153 m) per minute, the aircraft will take 32,500 divided by 500, or 65 minutes, to complete the descent. The aircraft will fly 325 miles (520 km) in 65 minutes. To allow 10 more miles (16 km) to the runway for final approach, the descent must be started 335 miles (536 km) from the landing field.






Back calculate descent rate. By knowing the time taken to execute the descent and the amount of the descent, the descent rate can be back calculated. The aircraft of the example descending 32,500 feet (9913 m) in 65 minutes is using a descent rate of 32,500 divided by 65, or 500 feet (153 m) per minute.

Take a seat.,
Take a breather.,
Level the aircraft.,
Turn on autopilot.,
Call for help on the radio.,
Use the airplane call sign when you talk with the controller.,
Maintain a safe speed.,
Begin the descent.,
Go for landing.,
Congratulate yourself.",How to Land an Airplane in an Emergency," The Captain usually sits in the left seat where the concentration of instruments are (especially for light single engine aircraft). Fasten your seat-belt and shoulder harness if so equipped. However, almost all aircraft have dual controls and you can successfully land the plane from either side. Do not touch the controls yet! The autopilot will most likely be engaged. Leave it on for now.


Make sure the unconscious pilot is not leaning on the control yoke (the plane's equivalent of a steering wheel). Some aircraft may have a side stick, which will be a joystick to the left of the captain's seat.;
, You'll probably be overwhelmed with the sensory overload and the seriousness of the situation. Remembering to breathe will help you focus. Take a slow, deep inhalation to tell your body you're in control.

, If the plane is noticeably ascending, descending, or turning, gently bring the plane into a level flight altitude using the outside horizon as your guide. Finally, all those days of joystick video games are about to pay off!


Look for the attitude indicator. Sometimes called the artificial horizon, it consists of a miniature set of ""wings"" and a picture of the horizon. The top is blue (for the sky) and the bottom is brown. On some complex aircraft, the attitude indicator is displayed on a computer screen in front of the pilot. For older aircraft, it is in the center of the top row of instruments. On modern-day airliners, there will be a Primary Flight Display (PFD) directly ahead of you. This displays vital information such as Indicated Airspeed (IAS) measured in knots, Ground Speed (GS), also measured in knots, altitude (measured in feet) and heading. It should also display whether or not the autopilot is engaged, usually denoted by AP or CMD.
Correct the pitch (climb or descent) and bank (turning) if necessary so that the miniature wings are level with the artificial horizon. If they are already level, do not touch the controls at all; move to the next step. If you do need to level the plane, however, adjust the flight attitude by pulling the yoke (or stick) toward you to bring the nose up or push it forward to lower the nose. You can correct bank (turning) by rotating the yoke or stick left or right to turn in that direction. Simultaneously, you must apply slight back pressure to the yoke to prevent the airplane from losing altitude.

, If you have been trying to correct the flight path, the autopilot is probably disengaged. Turn it on by pushing buttons labeled ""AUTOPILOT"" or ""AUTO FLIGHT,"" ""AFS"" or ""AP"" or something alike. On passenger airplanes it is situated in the center of the glare-shield panel, in a position where both pilots can easily reach it. On most flights during cruise stage, the autopilot is already on.


Only if this results in the aircraft doing things you do not want it to do, disengage it again by pushing all buttons you can find on the yoke (which then probably will include the autopilot disconnect button). Usually the best way to get an aircraft to fly in a stabilized way is to not touch the controls; it is designed to be stable and most people who are not trained pilots tend to over-control the plane.

, Look for a hand-held microphone, which is normally to the left of the pilot’s seat just below the side window, and use it like a CB radio. Find the microphone or take the pilot's headset, press and hold the button, and repeat ""Mayday"" three times followed by a brief description of your emergency (pilot unconscious, etc.). Remember to release the button to hear a response. An airport flight controller will help you fly the plane to a safe landing. Listen carefully and answer their questions to the best of your abilities so they can better assist you.


Alternatively, you can take the pilot's headset and press the push-to-talk (PTT) button, which is on the yoke. However, so is the autopilot button, and if you press it by accident, you could mess with the autopilot system. Stick with the hand-held radio.Attempt to call for assistance on the frequency you are currently on. - This is where the pilot was already communicating with someone only moments prior. Use the words ""May-Day, May-Day"" at the beginning of your call. If that fails after repeated attempts, and if you know how to change the radio frequencies with certainty, you can call for help on 121.50 MHz.

If you see a red light on the panel illuminated, tell the controller. Below the red light, there will a description of the light, e.g., Generator, Low Voltage. Obviously this requires prompt attention.


If you can find the Transponder on the radio stack (it has four windows of 4 numbers from 0-7, usually located near the bottom of the stack), set it to 7700. This is an emergency code that will quickly alert air traffic controllers that you have an emergency.

, The airplane's call sign is located on the panel (unfortunately, there's no standard location, but the call sign should be somewhere on the panel). Call signs for airplanes registered in the United States start with the letter ""N"" (e.g., ""N12345""). ""N"" can be confused with other letters over a radio, so say ""November."" Announcing the call will clearly identify the aircraft and will also give the flight controllers important information about the airplane so they can better help you land it.


If you are on a commercial aircraft (an aircraft operated by an airline, such as United, American, US Airways, etc.) the aircraft is not referred to by its ""N"" number. It is instead called by its call-sign, or the flight number. Sometimes pilots will put a sticky note on the panel to remind them. Ask a flight attendant what the flight number is. When you call on the radio, say the airline's name first, then say the number. If the flight number is 123 and you are flying United, your call-sign would be ""United 1-2-3"". Do not read the numbers like a normal number, so do not say ""United One-hundred twenty three.""

, Look for the airspeed indicator (usually labeled ASI, Airspeed or Knots) usually located toward the upper left of the instrument panel, and keep an eye on your speed. Speeds are either in MPH or Knots (similar values). Do not fly a small 2-seater less than 70 knots. Do not fly a large (Jumbo) less than 180 knots. Ultimately, just make sure the needle stays in the ""green"" zone for normal flight, until you can get someone on the radio to help.


If the airspeed starts increasing, and you haven't touched the throttle, you're probably going down, so pull back gently on the control yoke. If the airspeed is decreasing, gently push the nose down to increase the speed. Do not let the aircraft fly too slowly, especially near the ground. It may stall (the wing no longer produces lift).

, The controller you are talking to should brief you on the landing procedures for the aircraft and direct you to a safe spot to land. They will most likely line you up with the runway at an airport, but under rare circumstances you may have to land in a field or road. If you must land and can't get to an airport, avoid places with power lines, trees, or other obstacles.


To start reducing the plane's altitude, pull back the throttle (to reduce power) until you hear the sound of the engines change - then stop. The throttle levers are almost always located in between the Captain and First Officer's seat. Otherwise, it may be mounted on the ceiling in the center, close to the windscreen. It's impossible to generalize, but this probably shouldn't be more than ¼"" (0.6 cm) or so of throttle travel. Keep the airspeed within the green arc. The nose of the aircraft should drop on its own without pushing forward on the yoke.
If you find you are constantly pushing or pulling on the yoke to keep the airplane steady, you have to use trim to relieve those pressures. Otherwise, it can get very tiring and/or distracting. The trim wheel is typically a wheel approximately 6–8 inches (15.2–20.3 cm) in diameter that rotates in the same direction as the landing gear wheels. It is often located near your knees on either side. It is black and has small bumps on the outside edges. As you hold pressure against the yoke, gently turn the trim wheel. If the pressure you are holding gets greater, turn the wheel in the other direction until you no longer have to maintain the original level of pressure. Note: On some small airplanes, the trim wheel may be found on the headliner and in the shape of a crank. Also, on some larger aircraft the trim is in the form of a switch on the yoke (control stick). It is usually on the left near the top. If the aircraft is pushing the yoke towards you, then push the lever down. If it is pulling away, push the lever up.

, You'll be using a variety of drag devices (slats and flaps, next to the throttles) to slow the plane down without losing lift. Get the landing gear down, if it's retractable. If the gear is fixed, it's always down and you don't need to do anything. The gear handle (the end of the handle is shaped like a tire) is usually just to the right of the center console, above where the knee of the co-pilot would be. If you need to land on water, though, leave the landing gear up.


On most large, commercial aircraft, there will be a GPWS (or EGPWS for Airbus) system. What it does is when you reach a certain altitude (usually 2500, 1000, 500-100, 50-5), it will call out that altitude. It will also say ""Approaching Minimums"" and ""Minimums"". ""Approaching Minimums"" means you are 100 feet from approaching ""Minimums"", depending on what kind of approach you are executing. When ""Minimums"" sounds, you should check if the runway and/or the approach lights are in sight. If not, you must engage the TO/GA mode and execute a missed approach. (If you can't find the TO/GA button, just put the throttle to full).
Be sure to activate the autobrake and arm the spoilers (if any) if possible. Look for the autobrake knob, it's location will vary from aircraft to aircraft. The spoilers ensure a firm landing and reduce the chance of you flying up in the air when you flare.
Beware of crosswind. If there's a crosswind, then you must counter it by pushing going into a ""crab"" position. A ""crab"" is where your nose is pointing more or less in the direction of the where the wind is coming from. Generally, you want to experiment with the crab until you get the perfect angle to continue the approach. Use the rudder pedals if necessary.
Just before you touch down, you'll need to raise the nose to flare and land on the main wheels first. A flare is typically 5-7 degrees in a small aircraft with 60-70 knots, depending on your weight. In some larger aircraft, a flare may mean up to 15 degrees of nose up, with 140-150 knots, once again depending on your weight.
In a small general aviation aircraft, flare at 5-10 feet. On a small narrow-body airliner, flare at 10-15 feet. On a large, wide-body aircraft like the 777 or A380, you should start initiating your flare no lower than 20 feet. If you flare too high, you will float down the runway, causing you to use up more runway, and sometimes causes you to have a hard landing due to the plane slowing down while floating. You MUST retard the throttle (put it to idle) just before your flare.
If flying a large commercial aircraft, activate your reverse thrust, if the plane has it. On Boeing aircraft, there are bars behind the throttle quadrant. Pull the bars back all the way and the thrust will be directed forward to aid in stopping the aircraft. If all else fails, pull the throttle back as fast and far as possible. If there's a crosswind and you're misaligned with the runway, it may be a good idea to only activate one reverse thrust to realign the plane, then activate the next one once you are on the centerline.
Reduce power to idle by pulling the throttle all the way back, until you reach the sign labeled idle. It is normally a black lever usually located between the pilot and co-pilot.
Gently apply the brakes by pressing on top of the rudder pedals. Use enough pressure to stop the plane without skidding. The rudder pedals themselves are used to steer the plane on the ground, so don't use them unless the plane is veering off the runway.

, Once you get some help for the unconscious pilot, you can finally faint. Go ahead, you earned it. And if you can ever stand to see another airplane, let alone get on one, you just may have ""the right stuff"" and should consider taking flight lessons from a certified instructor. Then again, maybe not. Just write a book about it.

, A link will be sent to you. This link is your personalized web-based interview. You need to finish it within 48 hours.


Answer the questions honestly!
Set up a time when you can take the phone interview. If you meet the Disney standards for the web-based interview, then within a day or so you should get an email about setting up a day and time for a phone interview.

, According to Amber Sewell in the book ""Amber Earns Her Ears"", she said that the call will come through as a restricted number, so be prepared for it., The questions will most likely be formed like these:


Why do you want to be a part of the Disney College Program? The key to this question is about the College Program. It’s not about working for Disney or being a total fan of Disney
What are the top three roles, and different situations that could happen at work and at the apartment? Roles are the types of jobs that you have the chance of getting. For example, you could work in merchandise, or for attractions in the parks.

, For Disneyland contact here; for Walt Disney World use WDW recruiting address instead. Ask about making an appointment for an in person job interview. If you don't live in California or Florida, you'll need to make travel arrangements (and travel documentation if you live outside of the United States) to get to your specified location. You must be able to speak English.

, Answer the questions you get asked, and ask some questions about the job/program yourself. This is a time for both yourself and the company to get to know a little about your ways you interact with people. Ask as many questions you can, without it seeming like you haven’t done any research about the program.


Let the interviewer know you researched the online program, but that there are still questions about some things you still don't understand. If and when the interviewer asks you why you want to work for Disney Parks, infer through some of the Disney principles that you 'love Disney (include movie references and potential park references if you've ever been to them before to show just how much you love Disney and it's other guests).

, Some applicants get answers the very next day, while some it may take a few weeks. Disney says that you will get an answer between two and three weeks after your phone interview, but people hear things at different times. If you don't get an answer within the three weeks, ask about whether or not you qualify. If you don't get the specific job you applied for, ask Disney why.


Some people find out the very next day, and some in those few weeks. Regardless, the time it takes, certain is worth to wait.

, Don't despair, if they tell you that you haven't; there's always next time! If you do make it, you can rejoice. You made it: You are going to work for the Walt Disney Company! You will be working for one of the most successful companies in the world.

Cultivate repeat business.",How to Start a Limousine Company," The limousine business isn’t right for everybody. It is based on customer service and availability. If you’re not a people person, look elsewhere. If you want a 9-5 job, think again. People rent limos at all hours of the day, and the most lucrative jobs take place on the weekends. Be sure you’re comfortable with long, erratic hours before getting started in the business.;
, If you want to start with your own car, insurance, and website, you’re looking at $50-100,000, plus the monthly costs of gas and maintenance.If you’re starting a virtual call center, with only business cards, a toll-free number, and a website, you can get started for anywhere from $500-5,000, depending mostly on how much you invest in your website.

, You don’t even need a limousine to start a limousine company. Depending on how much you are willing to invest, you can start by building a customer base as a virtual call center, by buying a vehicle or two, or launching an entire fleet.


Virtual Call Center – All you need for this is a business card, website, and toll-free number. You will field calls or internet request for rides and subcontract them to limo services, taking up to a 20% commission. This is an inexpensive way to build a customer base and accrue capital.Drive A Vehicle – You will need to start with a black sedan (usually a Town Car) and/or a limousine (white is preferable at first), both of which will require a significant investment. On the other hand, driving your own vehicle will allow you to increase your revenue substantially.
Fleet – Launching a fleet is the riskiest way to start your business, as it requires a large outlay of capital to purchase multiple sedans and limousines. You will also have to hire a dispatcher and chauffeurs, who will typically pay a flat fee to use lease your vehicles ($75-$150 a day) or give you a percentage of their fares (usually one third). More vehicles on the road can mean more money, but it can also mean bigger losses if business is slow.

, Whatever type of limousine service you decide to launch, your business will benefit from a strategic plan that will guide you in achieving your goals. You can find more details about how to write a plan here, but broadly, you will want to include:


Your business concept: what you are offering, your strengths and weaknesses, long term goals, and performance indicators, beyond the bottom line, which will let you know you are succeeding or failing. These last might include important measures like the number of repeat customers and the number of inquiries you convert into sales.
Market research: the nature of the industry, who are your customers (business men, airport traffic, weddings, etc), who are the other limousine companies you will be competing with, what prices are charged. Remember that the goal is to sell service. This is a luxury business; being the cheap limousine company is not a good business model.
A marketing plan: how you will communicate with customers and grow your customer base.
An operations plan: identify the individual projects that will lead to completing your larger goals. To begin with, these might include things like: hiring a designer, registering your domain, and finding a webhost – all to build a website; or finding livery insurance, buying a car, and choosing billing options – all to prepare your vehicle for service.
Financial projections: these include a list of assets before you start the business; start-up costs such as building a website, getting insurance, obtaining permits, and purchasing a vehicle; marketing costs; and revenue projections. You will need to know how much business you need to do at what price in order to show a profit, and how long you can perform at a loss.
You can find a sample business plan for a limousine service here.

, There are consultants who specialize in the limousine business. They can help you identify lucrative markets, set rates, and advertise effectively. Particularly if you are new to the business, a consultant can make you money in the long run, despite the initial cost.

, A lawyer can help you decide on the most advantageous legal structure for your business and walk you through tax procedures and the necessary licenses and permits in your area., This will have implications for how you file taxes and how much you will need to pay. Most small businesses are sole proprietorships, which are the easiest to set up and require the least paperwork. If you are considering another legal structure, you may wish to consult a lawyer who can help you pick the structure best for you.Sole proprietorship – An unincorporated business run by an individual. No special steps are needed to form a sole proprietorship, and since there is no distinction between the business and you, the owner, the income from the business is reported as your income. You pay self employment tax.Because you will be personally liable for your business, this form is not recommended.
Partnership – A business where two or more people share ownership. To form one you must choose a name and register your business with your state. You must also register with the IRS and get a tax ID. Profits are passed through to the partners, who pay taxes on them on their individual tax return. This includes self employment tax. Partners are liable for their own actions and those of their partners.Limited liability company (LLC) – To start an LLC, you must, at a minimum, choose a name and file articles of organization with your state, often for a fee. LLC owners pay taxes on profits through their individual income tax returns and have to pay self employment tax, but are protected from personal liability for the decisions and actions of the company.Corporation – An independent legal entity owned by shareholders. To register your corporation you must choose a company name and file articles of incorporation with your state. You will also need to register with the IRS and get a tax ID. Corporations file taxes separately from their owners. This may prove advantageous, allowing owners to take advantage of the corporate tax rate, but it may also lead to double taxation. You should speak with your lawyer or accountant to see if this form of business will benefit you.S Corporation – An independent legal entity owned by shareholders, like a typical corporation, except that to avoid double taxation, profits and losses are passed through to the owners’ personal tax returns, instead of the company paying taxes., If you are working as an independent contractor under your own name, you don’t need one. But if your limousine business has a name other than your own, you will need to register that name as a DBA., Corporations that must file tax returns will need one, as well as partnerships, which don’t file taxes, but do have to file business information annually with the IRSYou will also need a tax ID if you have employees. Drivers are usually hired as independent contractors who cover their own payroll taxes, but for a dispatcher or other employees, your company will be responsible for half their payroll taxes, and must thus have a tax ID with which to pay them.

, Most states and some localities levy a business or corporate income tax. If you are a sole proprietor, you will pay this tax as part of your personal income return, while LLCs and corporations will be taxed separately from their individual owners. If you have employees, you will also need to pay state worker’s compensation insurance and unemployment insurance taxes.You can find more information on tax laws for businesses in your state here.

, Depending on the laws in your area, you will need to obtain permits for your business, vehicle, yourself, or all three in order to operate a limousine or black car, and sometimes another permit to pick up passengers at the airport. Depending on the locality and how competitive the market is, these permits will cost from around $100 to several thousand dollars.

, Personal auto insurance usually has a livery exclusion, meaning your passengers and car will not be covered if you are using it for hire. Start searching for a business auto policy that covers livery service early, as it can take 4 to 6 weeks to get in place., Most clients find their limousines online, so a website is vital.Unless you are an experienced site designer, you will probably want to hire a professional to create a polished website.Web designers will build your site and take care of registering your domain name and selecting a webhost. The more you pay, the more input you will have in creating a unique site.
The cost of web design varies depending on whether you use a solo developer in the US ($25-$100/hr), an offshore web company ($10-$40/hr), or an established US agency ($60-$200/hr).Offshore firms can design sites starting at around $500,while the cost of a US firm will usually range from $5,000-$10,000, with solo developers falling somewhere in-between., You will most frequently be charged by the minute for your toll-free numbers. Call around for the best rates. Once you have the number, you can print business cards with it and your website. These cards are a key way to grow your business. You will give them to customers and leave them at clubs and hotels.

, If you are establishing a virtual call center, you will need to negotiate contracts with existing limousine companies that specify the commission you will receive. Otherwise, you will need to purchase a vehicle.


A black Town Car is a good starter for airport transfers and corporate customers. It is less expensive than a stretch limo.
A stretch limo is necessary for most of the most lucrative services – weddings, funerals, proms and graduations – so you’ll want to add one to your fleet as soon as possible. Start with a white limo, as these are most popular for weddings, proms, graduations, and other special events.If possible, purchase both a black sedan and a limousine so that you can provide the full range of services – airport and corporate business during the week, and special events on the weekends.

, You can install a meter in your car, but limousine drivers are increasingly opting for online services that schedule appointments, notify drivers where to pick up customers, and handle payment.

, Even if you know your town like the back of your hand, there will be addresses that you’ve never heard of. A navigation system will not only ensure that you don’t get lost, it can also help you avoid traffic, thereby greatly improving your clients’ experience.

, Advertising is the key to succeeding in the limousine business. The more inquiries you receive, and the more of those inquiries you convert into sales, the more money you can make. A polished website and business cards are a key starting point. Also consider:


Pay-per-click advertising – Buying internet traffic is the quickest way to bring people to your website. However, make sure you are targeting the right audience. Clicks cost you money, and if tons of visitors leave without purchasing your services or product, you can lose money.The two major advertisers are GoogleAds and Facebook.
Craigslist, the yellow pages, and radio spots – Make sure you have a professional ad in both the yellow pages and craigslist, for those who search there. Radio spots can be effective, though they are more expensive than internet advertising.
Hotels and night clubs – Talk with the manager and drop off your card. Consider giving 5% commission to hotel doormen and club staff. If someone needs a limo, you want to be the person they recommend., Profit margins are low on airport clientele, but the business tends to be steady over the course of the year. It thus provides a good base of revenue for your company between weekend wedding hires and the prom / graduation season., Airport transfers and corporate hires will help keep you in the black, but the real money to be made is in special events, which require a limousine.


Weddings - Weddings are a good reason to get a stretch limo. They require a higher level of service – a tuxedo-ed driver, champagne beverage, coordination with the bride – but also pay very well.Funeral Service - Again, this is a specialized service that takes place mostly on weekends. You will need a pressed black suit and a non-ostentatious black limousine.Proms and Graduations – Though the season for them only lasts two months, these events provide the greatest profit for limousine companies.Consider increasing advertising before and during the season.

, For events that book in advance, you’ll want the clients to sign a contract that stipulates a non-refundable 20% deposit to protect you in case they back out for some reason. This is not uncommon, particularly with graduations., The best way to hire chauffeurs is to go to airports and pick out well-dressed chauffeurs in the baggage area. Offer them your card and ask them to call you if they’re not happy working where they are.Have your lawyer write up contracts, and decide on how you will collect money from your drivers: as a monthly fee for leasing your vehicle or as a percentage of their fares.

, This is the key to success in the limousine business. Your website should collect client information. Use it to create email and physical mail lists. Send mail to thank customers and encourage them to use your service again. Also, always be sure to hand out your business card to passengers. Most importantly, offer professional, courteous service that makes customers want to return.

How many cars do you plan to service in a day and how many staff members will you take on?


Will you only offer a specialized service, such as oil changes and tire repairs, or will you offer a more comprehensive range of repairs?
Will you buy a currently operating car repair shop or start a brand new one from scratch? What are the costs and benefits of each of these options?
Do you plan to remain an independent repair shop or will you join a franchise like Jiffy Lube or Midas? You will generally need $30,000-$200,000 to join a franchise, but the advantage is that they will handle marketing and they often have a nationally trusted brand name for potential customers. If you do not have any existing customers in your current career that you know would follow you to a new business, joining a franchise might be worth the investment.;
, Your business plan will be shaped by the potential locations for your car repair shop. Leasing a current repair shop might be cheaper than buying one or building one from the ground up.Look for locations that are convenient to either highway or main road access. If your shop is very isolated, it is unlikely customers will come to you, especially when towing costs are often tallied by the mile.
Your location should also be able to accommodate an office for you to take care of your administrative needs and a waiting room area for your customers.

, The price of equipment will most likely be your largest cost after the cost of the location. Will you rent your equipment or will you buy it outright? You will most likely need a specialized set of mechanic's tools ($15,000), at least one diagnostics machine ($5,000), and a lift with an installation ($3,700)., With the cost of equipment, insurance, rent , and payment for your staff, you will probably need somewhere between $50,000-$100,000 to open your business, depending on your location.You should clearly detail any loans your plan to apply for in order to fund your business? Will you apply for a business loan from your bank, from the Small Business Administration, or from another source? To get approved, you must have a healthy financial history (with good credit, no history of bankruptcy) and be able to demonstrate that you have roughly 70% of the funding already raised.If you are denied a loan from the Small Business Administration or your local bank, then you could consider other lenders like OnDeck and Kabbage if you need cash quickly. These lenders are meant for short-term loans because their interest rates are very high.If you choose to take a loan from friends or family members, still put the repayment terms of this loan in writing. You do not want to risk losing relationships in the event that you cannot repay the loan in a timely manner.

, Most importantly, you should clearly state in your business plan what your shop will provide that no other shop in your area does. Will you provide the lowest prices, the fastest turnaround, or the best customer service? Why should a customer pick your business over your competitors?


You can also consider if you will specialize in a niche field, like restoring old cars, or providing environmentally friendly or ""green"" services to your customers.Defining your USP will help lay the foundation for your broader marketing plan once you open your store.

, States have different licensing requirements for auto repair business. Check your local motor vehicle department for information about the type of license that you will need to operate an auto repair shop in your state. To obtain a license in your state, you will need to:



Fill out an application. Your motor vehicle department can provide you with an application to apply for your license.

Meet eligibility requirements. In most states, you will need to meet certain eligibility requirements to be allowed to apply. These requirements may include things like your age, credit, and criminal record.

Provide required documents and information. You may need to include some other documents and information such as proof that the building you plan to use has been zoned for your business, your tax ID number, and color photographs of your facility.

Pay any fees required to process the application. The application fee may be as low as $20, but if approved, you may need to pay $300 or more to obtain the license., Before approving your application, most states require you to have a minimum amount of insurance for liability purposes. This amount may be as low as $50,000 or as high as $300,000.Check with your state’s motor vehicle department to determine how much insurance you will need to obtain for your business.

, You will need a clear financial system in place in order to operate as a business and to anticipate potential pitfalls.Consider hiring an accountant or a financial advisor to help you establish a budget for your expenses as a new business. An accountant can help you manage your taxes, your payroll system, and advise you on the best bookkeeping system to use in your business.
You should also consider retaining a lawyer in case you face any suits or claims from your clients. Ask other mechanics in your area which lawyers they use and like.

, Your success as a business will depend on how you relate to your customers and potential customers



Define your core values as a brand. What are three words your customers should think of when they think of your business? You might think of words like ""honest,""""loyal,"" and ""dependable.""Print eye-catching flyers. You can place them in places where lots of customers might congregate, such as gyms, civic centers, office parks, and the parking lots at universities and college campuses.

Establish a loyalty program. You might offer your customers a free oil change after they come to see you for another service (like an engine repair or heating/air conditioning repair). You can also send coupons in the mail to your neighbors or consider offering a digital discount through a service like Groupon.Consider advertising on TV or on the radio. TV commercials and radio ads may also help you to reach a wider audience and gain new customers.

, Some car dealers have their own mechanical shops attached to their businesses, but others don't. You should consider approaching dealers and asking them if they could refer customers to your business. In return, you could also advertise for their business when your customers want to buy a new car.

, For minor repairs -- like tire changes -- you might consider offering roadside assistance or going to customers' homes to help them. This will help your customers associate you with loyalty and convenience., Your business can only grow in prestige if your technicians gain certification. Most automotive technicians gain certification from the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence.


Technicians must have a two-year degree and a year of formal experience working as an automotive technician (or mechanic).
You can become certified in a number of specializations, ranging from school bus repair, collision repair, trucking equipment, and more.Gaining certification can help your business gain more credibility in the eyes of your customers.

, If your shop becomes profitable, and you have a surplus of customers, consider opening an additional location in an area that you would be more convenient to other customers.You should only do this if you get to the point where your first branch runs smoothly on a daily basis. Make sure you have reliable and capable managers to help you. If you still have to run daily demands by yourself, then it might not be the best time to expand.

",How to Start a Headlight Restoration Franchise Business," Replacing a damaged headlight with a new one is becoming less of an option these days. With the escalating cost of these new headlights, price conscious consumers are in need of a cost effective alternative. With an average replacement cost of $1000 per set of lights, headlight restoration offers a cost-effective solution to replacement. External headlight issues that require replacement or restoration include: oxidation, tarnishing, cracks, sand-pitting, rock-chips, and scratching due to collision. In addition, internal issues such as fixing damaged headlight seals, leaking cracks, headlight condensation, and HID hazed lenses can generate huge profits as current kits and conventional methods cannot address these issues. An internally damaged headlight can generally be repaired for $50 - $200. An externally damaged headlight can be reconditioned for $50 – 100 with the work being performed in 30-60 minutes. The replacement cost of OEM Headlights ranges from $400 to $6400 per light. The numbers clearly favor repair over replacement. It is mutually beneficial to all parties involved.;
, The headlight reconditioning industry is fragmented into small, sporadically located mobile services, and a few headlight kit manufacturing companies. This is precisely what makes the industry ripe for the emergence of a high-quality specialty franchise. The small mobile services suffer from a lack of name recognition and legitimacy, network support/pricing and skilled headlight repair technicians. The kit manufacturers offer poor quality kits that have a reputation for peeling, yellowing, and oxidizing within a few months. New car dealerships, repair shops, car washes, and detail shops are all in need of a service which provides quick, efficient and accurate repair and reconditioning.

, As an entrepreneur, starting your own business is filled with obstacles from building credibility to establishing customer base and ensuring customer retention. A franchise has already spent time and money establishing its brand as a nationally recognized industry leader. This allows its franchisees to take advantage of immediate credibility with consumers.
Selling Power: Ask anyone you know who has ever tried selling their service to a new car dealership and they will tell you it is close to impossible. Large nationwide accounts prefer to negotiate with national companies. Franchise sales staff will do just that… Sales associates will negotiate with new car dealerships, national auto service centers, insurance companies and others to help ensure your success over your local competitors.
Proven Success Record: To make a new business as successful as an existing franchise you would first have to develop a comparable headlight restoration process and be proficient in all areas of the business: Legal, Sales, Marketing, Accounting, Computer Science, Promotions, Telemarketing Sales, Tax Law, & Back Office Services. Buying a franchise eliminates the learning curve and allows you to concentrate completely on achieving your goals.
Buying Power: When a local business buys a roll of tape, the business often purchases for a single location only; therefore, it is buying a lower quantity at a premium price. When a franchisee buys the same product – even the same volume of product – it can take advantage of national accounts that significantly reduce costs for the individual dealer. Taking advantage of substantial buying power will help reduce your franchise´s expenses over your local competitors.
Networking Opportunities: Unlike individual businesses that can´t share best practices with one another owing to competitive pressures, our franchise system is designed to allow for networking and knowledge share in a non-competitive environment. That way, you´ll be in a better position to learn from not only the franchises corporate staff, but also from other more experienced franchisees.

, Franchisees command more money for three reasons: brand recognition, consistency of finish and warranties. Customers like the peace-of-mind that comes with the knowledge that an individual’s work and warranty is backed by a national company. Depending on the particular franchise, you may have free access to personal website development, search engine optimization, on-line ad creation and more… Some franchises even offer their franchises complete turn-key build-out including on-site training and commercial account acquisition, allowing the new franchisee to begin generating substantial revenue immediately.

Market your car insurance company.",How to Start a Car Insurance Company," This license allows you to legally sell car insurance in the state in which you hope to operate your business, and ensures that you have the necessary knowledge and skills to do so.Attend a pre-licensing course. You will likely be required to takes courses covering both insurance and ethics. These courses will be specific to the state in which you are hoping to acquire a license. Most are available online and can be completed at your own pace, but do require courses fees.
Take a state-administered exam. This is required to obtain an insurances license in most states.
Find out what the requirements are for your state from its department of insurance (which sometimes go by various names). They will also notify you of the financial and other requirements related to licensing.
Some states will allow you to transfer your license from state to state.;
, Your business plan should outline how you'll attract customers, which insurance carriers you'll work with, and what your start-up costs are expected to be, as well as your projected income for the first few years of business.Of course, there are some simpler decisions to make as well.


Choose the specific location of your business. You must know the state or states in which you intend to operate to get an insurance license.
Determine the actual city in which you will locate your business as well. This will help you start to consider whether you will be buying, leasing, or building an office.
Know that the specifics of your business plan are likely to change as you begin to build your business.
One immediate necessity of an insurance company is the ability to determine risk when insuring your clients. (Larger companies, with whom you may be able to partner or purchase information from, will have the best access to this sort of information and the cutting-edge technologies with which it is derived.)

, The more policies you have, the more policy options and different rates you can offer your clients. You can even sell policies offered by other larger insurance providers.Be sure to offer liability insurance, collision insurance, and comprehensive insurance, as well as multi-car insurance policies and umbrella policies.
Diminish unanticipated surprises by getting advice on your business plan from lawyers, accountants, public relations professionals, and other business people as early as you’re able to do so.
Develop strong relationships with contacts at other insurance providers and carriers, at all levels of the industry. These people, who you should treat as both professional peers and as friends, will likely become key avenues of information, if not formal business partners.
Research what’s available independently. Familiarize yourself with all of the plans you will have the capability to offer (both when you open and as you grow), as well as what it will take to offer them. Some of these will necessitate cooperation with other insurance businesses.
The sooner you know who you need to work with, and who you would like to work with in the future, the better you can develop those relationships.

, Business acquisition has the advantages of saving time, acquiring an existing customer base, and avoiding startup costs. There are always opportunities to franchise or partner with successful insurance companies as well.Purchasing or buying into an existing company is both easier and more reliable than starting your own business – in part because the business plan is already developed and has likely been put into effect.
Build your own brand to have full control of your insurance company by starting from scratch.
Add an insurance company to your business portfolio by buying a franchise or partnering with an established insurance agency.

, You need to have a good idea of how much it will cost to get the company up and running. There’s no benchmark amount that is required to start a car insurance company. Your business model, your location, your experience, and your business partnerships will all greatly affect this figure.There are guaranteed expenses associated with licensing, which can be quite substantial – figures in some states can reach several hundreds of thousands of dollars. While you may be able to fully license your company for under $100,000, recognize that costs such as rent, your own salary, and other necessary expenses can quickly add up.
Contact the Small Business Administration (SBA) for information regarding the likely costs you will incur in starting a business, and for help securing the funding to do so.

, If you're planning to run your car insurance company as a full-time job, you will likely need to secure financing to do so. This will likely require either a loan or investment capital from private investors to cover your start-up costs and living expenses until you start generating revenue.Whereas banks are sometimes hesitant offering new business loans, the SBA exists specifically to help start and run small businesses.
Reach out to any personal connections you have in the business world. Private investors can be a great source of investment capital.
Have a carefully prepared proposal ready when you apply for financing. This should contain details including the total capital you require, the salary you intend to pay yourself, and other initial expenses for the first few years. This will help potential financiers assess the risk involved in a potential loan or investment.

, In order to sell insurance, you need to register in the city in which you tend to do business. You also need to get a business license from the city.Fill out all necessary applications and pay the associated fees. While it is unlikely that you will have to undergo any further testing or coursework, there will certainly be paperwork and necessary payments.
If you intend to hire employees or hope to incorporate your business, you will also need to acquire an agency license.

, Other aspects of your long term business plan will necessitate identifying customers and the specific sales strategies that will appeal to them, hiring qualified employees, and identifying competitors.Once it feels like you’re ready to go, there are likely a few more things to do.
Be sure you’ve met all legal requirements and have protected yourself and your business.
Purchase liability and property insurance for your car insurance company to protect your assets in case of a natural disaster, an accident, and to protect from losses associated with lawsuits.
Finalize which specific insurance policies you want to sell. Though much of this will have been determined by this point, you may realize you have more of a capacity to differentiate options than you had previously thought.
Again, be sure you’re equipped to provide as much as possible to your customers. For instance, consider selling insurance for special niches, such as vintage car insurance, motorcycle insurance, and RV insurance.

, You need to be able to identify and contact potential clients. Advertising is a necessity, and it’s worth reaching out to people you know. The keys to marketing are identifying your target market, noting what makes your products unique, and developing a strategy to communicate the reasons to purchase insurance from your company.Advertise in local publications, at driving schools, at the DMV, and online.
Contact family members, friends, business associates and everyday acquaintances to notify them of your new business.
Emphasize – in both conversations and all marketing materials – opportunities for potential clients to save money by switching to an insurance policy offered by your company.

Drive around the neighborhood. Study the traffic patterns and get to know the busy intersections. Look for locations that are likely to have a lot of travel and draw customers from local business., Visit the local police station and find out about crime or other activity in the area of your prospective business. Ask about the history of criminal activity at that particular gas station or at other similar business in the area. Find out how active the police are at patrolling that neighborhood.To ensure that you get full attention, you should call the police station ahead of time and ask to make an appointment with someone. This will work better than just dropping in unannounced.
In some jurisdictions, you may be able to review local police activity on the police department's website.

, The Chamber of Commerce exists to help local business communicate with each other and share their successes. Visit the Chamber of Commerce and ask about the strengths and weaknesses of the community. You should be able to find out if new businesses are growing or closing in the area. Even if you cannot schedule a meeting in person, visit the chamber’s website and learn what you can.From a chamber’s website, you can learn about community activities, charitable donations, and business involvement in community leadership.
The Nashville Chamber of Commerce, for example, has a special section of its website dedicated just to relocating in the area and starting a new business., Visit the public library and read through several weeks or months of the local paper. Look at the police “blotter,” a common article that reports police activity in town. Look for stories of crime against gas stations. Look for information about growth or decrease in the local population. Try to get a feeling for the community’s attitude toward new business., After you have narrowed down your options, visit the station you are thinking of buying. Notice all the details. Is it easy to enter the station or is the traffic pattern difficult? Is the layout of the pumps easy to maneuver? Keep in mind that some things may be easy to change when you take over, but some things may not, or could be expensive.For example, cleaning up the bathrooms and repairing fixtures would be a relatively small cost. However, if you find that the plumbing does not work at all, you could be in for a serious unexpected expense.

, Run a search for “commercial real estate” in the location that interests you. You should find listings for several commercial real estate brokers. Review their websites to see the kinds of properties they handle. Find a company that specializes in retail businesses, and particularly gas stations if possible.

, If most of them appear to be office spaces, that company is probably not for you. They might be able to handle a gas station, but it won’t be their specialty. Find a company that seems to show several similar businesses.


For example, in the St. Louis, Missouri, area, A&M Realty, Inc., lists several gas stations and convenience stores on its website. This is probably a company that will be able to help you (in that area)., When you find an agency that looks like it can help you with commercial properties, call to schedule an appointment with a broker. Meet with the broker and ask questions about what the agency can offer you. In particular, you may ask some of the following questions:


”How familiar are you with this community?”
”How many sales of gas station businesses have you or your company been involved with in the past year?”
”What special concerns do I need to think about when buying a gas station?”
”What can you or your agency do to help me with licensing and other state regulations?”

, Find out what the real estate agency can do to help you. There is much more in buying a gas station business than just looking for a property. You will want a real estate agency that can help you analyze the market, look at the business’s financial records, and understand the community.


For example, in the Boca Raton and Tampa, Florida, areas, the Commercial Florida agency offers such strategic services as:site selection
feasibility studies
market forecasts
demographics
research services



, A commercial real estate broker should be familiar with the available gas station properties in the area. Ask the broker to arrange visits, so you can tour the facility and speak with the owner or business manager. When you visit, look at the facility, the structure of the buildings, the traffic patterns, and the location of the pumps. Ask to see the company’s sales records and financial accounts.

, Many gas stations contain convenience stores or sell some additional items. Gas stations generally make more profit from their convenience store than from the sale of gas alone. Check out the kind of store, the number of products sold, and its overall cleanliness and appearance. These will all be indications of a successful business., Buying a franchise, as opposed to an independently owned station, comes with the value of a recognized name. Whether you look to buy a Shell, Sunoco, Texaco or other name, you automatically become part of a recognized brand. That brand adds value to the station itself and will likely attract some level of business to your station., When you buy into a franchise, the national company will provide certain legal protections. This can be a big advantage of buying a franchise business rather than an independent gas station. If you buy an independent station, you may be left on your own.One of the biggest concerns of owning and operating a gas station business is the threat of tank leakage and environmental damage. Most franchise purchases will protect you in such cases. The national company will often take on the responsibility.
You will need to read the franchise agreement very carefully to make sure that you fully understand your liabilities and those of the national company.

, Buying into a franchise carries the benefit of a well-known name and some financial protection, but you will be responsible for substantial fees and other financial expectations. Read the franchise agreement carefully to know what these are. Learn the requirements of owning a franchise before you buy the station.For example, you will likely be required to purchase your gas from the company’s own designated suppliers, at their chosen prices.
You will be required to pay for insurance for the company’s pumps and other fixtures. #*You will likely have to pay regular franchise fees.

, If you buy into a franchise, the national company may have the right to approve other franchises very close to your own location. While you cannot control or limit all competition, you don't want competition coming from your own brand. You should negotiate this point before buying into a franchise and try to set as wide a radius as possible., Once you buy the property, you will become responsible for any environmental hazards it contains. You need to find out about these hazards before purchasing. You have to determine whether the gas tanks are leaking or have leaked anything into the soil that you may have to clean up.Check the telephone book or Internet to find agencies in your area that perform environmental testing. Before engaging anyone, explain the purpose of the testing and your desire to purchase the property.

, The seller may not volunteer information about the quality of the storage tanks unless you inquire. You should ask the owner for copies of any purchase receipts or technical specifications of the tanks. Make sure that the tanks meet the current minimum requirements for your state.In California, for example, gas station tanks must be made of double-walled fiberglass (DWFG) with leak detection sensors.
To find the requirements in your state, you may need to hire an attorney. Alternatively, try calling the office of the Secretary of State. Each state will have its own office that sets the regulations.

, You need to know what you are buying. Purchasing a business may be separate from purchasing the property that the business rests on. You need to ask to see the title for the property. If you find out that the sale is only for the business and not the property included, you will need to adjust the purchase price accordingly. Don’t pay as much for the business as you would for the business and the land.A real estate attorney can help you review the paperwork to tell you what your purchase includes.

, Do not assume that the streets and businesses in the area of your prospective gas station will stay the same. You should check the city zoning department and office of public works to find out if any major changes are coming. A new road could divert traffic away from your site, seriously devaluing the business. If the city has plans to change zoning, you should find out before getting committed to the location., Unless you have sufficient cash to buy the business on your own, you will need to visit a bank or other lender to secure a loan. Search online to compare business loan mortgage rates. Find a lender whose rates are competitive. Meet with a bank officer to complete an application and obtain approval.


You will need to provide a great deal of personal and financial information as part of a loan application. Be prepared to turn over information about your employment history, bank accounts, and tax records.
With many lenders, you can prequalify for a business loan. It is a good idea to begin this process and obtain prequalification before you finalize your search for a specific property., The real estate broker can assist you in evaluating the asking price for any particular gas station property. You should consider the prices of other gas stations available in the area, along with the recent history of sales of similar businesses. The broker should have these records. Analyze the company’s sales and financial records to gauge the likely success of the business itself. When you are ready, have your broker submit your offer., Your first offer is not likely to match the seller’s asking price. Also, the seller is not likely to accept your first offer. Work with your broker to negotiate a purchase price that you believe is a good one. Part of negotiating may include not only the price itself but also the terms of payment., A good commercial broker should be able to help you with the state regulatory requirements. You will at least need to have the tanks and soil inspected. Beyond that, each state will have its own expectations and requirements."

Even if you’re fully capable of top notch auto body work, starting a business requires substantial research, analysis, and consideration. In short, have a thorough business plan in place before committing to opening a business of your own.Start by writing a detailed company description. For instance, address whether you’ll have a full-service shop of specialize in one service. Will it cater to a specific clientele, such as Japanese cars, or provide service to any type of vehicle?
A well-developed business plan will help at every step of the process. In particular, you'll benefit from more favorable lease agreements, credit lines, conversations with potential vendors, funding opportunities, and even operational practices.
Don’t think of a business plan as a tool to help you run a business. Instead, develop your plan as a way to decide whether you can move forward opening an auto body repair shop in a particular area.;
, The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is the best source of assistance in starting your own business. In particular, the SBA provides instructions and formatting guidelines to help you write a business plan. These materials are available for free online. The SBA will also be able to notify you of other helpful organizations that might have more specific advice regarding the auto repair industry.The SBA can also link you with local organizations, individuals, and resources to help plan, finance, and open a business.
Further, the SBA may be able to link you with a successful business professional that is willing to donate their time to help a small business. If this opportunity is available, ask about working with someone who has experience working with auto shops.

, Particularly if you do not have experience starting small businesses, you’re going to need a good amount of guidance. For instance, do you know how to construct a profit and loss statement, balance sheet, and other financial statement? If not, you’ll need to hire, befriend, or otherwise acquire the assistance of an account. You’ll likely also need a lawyer to determine the best structure of your business. Finally, bankers see plenty of business plans – you can likely find one that’s willing to look at yours and provide feedback free of charge.While other auto-body repair shops may not want to help the competition, contact other local businesses that work on automobiles in a different capacity. For instance, parts stores or junkyards will likely know a lot about the local automotive community, including potential customers.
Particularly if the ownership of your business will be shared, or you’ll be taking out loans to cover start-up costs, make sure to talk to both a lawyer and a financial professional while crafting your business plan.

, There are often city, county, and state-level small business centers that are tasked with the enforcement of business regulations. Auto body shops require various special licenses and permits, and these offices can tell you what you will need and help you get it. The SBA can help link you up with local offices that can inform you of the regulations you’ll need to meet.Auto-repair shops must have permits to do business, as well as specific permits to perform particular types of jobs, such as paint-removal and painting.
It’s helpful to know about any pertinent regulations during the planning phase, to incorporate any potential costs or other issues associated with meeting these requirements.

, Aside from knowing where business will come from, you also need to know how much – and how fast – the business can be expected to grow. Be able to articulate where, specifically, money will come from, as well as what operational expenses will be. For instance, initial and recurring costs must be recorded, as well as a loan repayment plan, and the level of profits that are expected each month or quarter.Forecast these figures for the first three years after opening.
Decide on the prices your shop will charge for specific services. These can be used alongside your anticipated customer projections to determine revenue estimates.
Establish a “break-even” point. This is the point at which the business will be generating revenue, as opposed to spending money as it gets up and running. It may take longer to “break even” than you initially realize.

, Simply stated, you need to know how much money you’ll need to open the business and maintain operations until your shop starts generating revenue. If you intend to borrow money by way of a loan, it is especially important to determine a concrete dollar amount to ask for. Unfortunately, there's no ballpark number, since differences in location, equipment, and shop size can cause start-up costs for auto body repair shops to fluctuate considerably. This is partly why is so important to develop a solid business plan, as it is the best way to accurately estimate your start-up costs.Know that SBA-insured loans are one of the best sources of funding for a small business. This is another reason you should follow the SBA’s guidelines when developing your business plan.

, Equipment expenses are commonly underestimated. While you may be able to save money buying used equipment, there is a greater chance of unforeseen costs associated with maintaining older equipment. A good rule of thumb: estimate your initial equipment and inventory expenses and increase the number by thirty percent. While this may seem like a huge amount of money, it's far better to wind up spending less than expected than it is to wind up needing to borrow more.For example, if you estimate needing $100,000 dollars' worth of equipment to open the shop, plan to secure funding for $130,000 dollars' worth of equipment.
Make a detailed list of all the equipment you’ll need and its cost. This should include everything: lifts, wheel balancers, hoists, paint guns, paint mask, and the decorations in the reception area.
If you intend to lease some equipment, consider a SBA-backed loan, which may offer you a low interest loan with no down payment to pay for equipment.

, In simplest terms, plan to open an auto body shop in the best location you can afford. In particular, you want a location that is easily accessible from major roads. Ensure any location you’re considering is zoned for commercial use. Taking out a slightly larger loan to help finance a business in a location where it is more likely to succeed may even allow for you to negotiate a lower interest rate., You have the option of franchising your business as opposed to opening and running your own business from the ground up. The main benefit of franchising is a considerable reduction in the likelihood that your business fails. This relative advantage is based on multiple factors, including name recognition, large scale marketing, and ""tried-and-true"" managerial and operational procedures.To find out about franchising options in your areas, contact the corporate offices for the auto body repair ""chains"" that are popular in your state. Be sure to contact them all, and be aware that they may be willing to meet or beat another franchise's offer. Seek the advice of an account and/or lawyer regarding any specific legal or financial questions you have.
Of course, there are costs associated with franchising. The bottom line is that you'll make a smaller portion of what your shop pulls in, though this depends on your specific franchising agreement. On the other hand, you may also avoid costs that may be incurred if you open a business on your own and make errors that a franchising agreement may have prevented.

, Assess whether a market exists for the type of business you hope to open. In the most basic sense, a comprehensive business plan helps identify potential issues before they arise. In particular, ensure that there’s actually business to get!Specific statistics to look out for include the number, age, and types of vehicles in the area you’re considering. Additionally, find out what insurance companies are commonly used in the area, and how many similar businesses you’d be competing with.

, Large businesses that you may want to work with can offer you a wealth of knowledge, and potentially even assist you. Often, these companies will make business development consultants available to potential new partners. Some may even be willing to help with your business plan, as your success would potentially lead to further business for them.Further, they may help you with marketing. They will have access to marketing data, and will be up-to-date on new technologies and marketing practices. You can also likely find quick assistance from business partners regarding layout and design of your marketing materials.
Establish positive relationships with specific employees at suppliers. This will likely help ensure the supply channels you will rely on once your business is open run smoothly.

, Marketing plans are some of the most important features of a solid business plan. The options are endless: consider flyers, print ads in local publications, and online advertising. When writing about the services and products you’ll provide, describe them as though whomever is reading them knows nothing about auto body repair. In particular, outline how what you offer will be different from what competitors already offer.Reach out to the local auto-restoration community. People who frequently work on classic or antique cars will often work with auto body shops. You can even offer people who are active in these communities discounts, knowing that they may valuable sources of recurring business., It may prove to be extremely lucrative to be on insurance companies’ “recommended repair facility” lists. Often, people will ask their insurance companies who to go to for service, particularly when they anticipate their insurance company paying for some or all of the service. By developing good relationships with those companies directly, you’ll bring in additional customers.Feel free to be direct. Ask insurance company representatives how you can get on the recommended repair facilities list.

, While experience is highly valuable, it’s also vital that your employees are trustworthy and polite. Personable service leads to happier customers, better reviews, and more business. More simply, friendly, happy employees lead to happy customers. Hire accordingly.


Include detailed estimates of anticipated labor costs in your business plan as well. For instance, employer-paid taxes and benefits will likely lead to high labor costs than you would foresee based only on the going hourly rate for auto techs.

, You'll need to register your business with the city, state and federal government. Since specific registration requirements will vary, contact your state’s DMV for information on the requirements in your area. Plan to prove that you have ownership or permission to use the facilities where your shop is located, as well as proof of the appropriate zoning. Further, you’ll need proof of an official business name, as well as proof of worker’s compensation insurance., Your shop will be generating hazardous wastes that will affect both air and water quality near your facility. Accordingly, you must demonstrate that you are consistently meeting both state and federal regulations. The regulations you’ll need to meet depend on what services you offer at your shop, as well as it’s location and proximity to municipal facilities. Find your state’s guide to environmental compliance for auto repair shops on the Environmental Protection Agency website."

Buy advertising that spans several medial modalities, such as print, radio and Internet.,
Include clear instructions in every call to action in all of your dealership's advertising.,
Get the name and contact information of every single person who calls or visits.,
Maintain any given campaign for a minimum of 4 to 6 months.,
Review the performance of your dealership advertising every quarter, based on the real responses you keyed from your call to action.",How to Get More Out of Your Dealership's Advertising," Each ad should contain the same call-to-action code or other identifier so that you will learn which ad campaigns generated the most leads.


A specific special or discount, such as 15 percent off one item or a free trinket with each purchase, is a good choice for this. The discount will help people to remember and the different discounts will clearly identify which marketing initiative brought a customer in.;
, Don't just present your name and what you do. Rather, invite people to come in -- maybe even on a specific day -- to specifically buy what you have to offer.

, Use that information to create a ""tickler list"" that sends advice, advertising or other news to all list members every 1 to 2 months.


Contacting people on your ""tickler list"" less often won't keep your name in their minds. Contacting more often risks annoying them and getting filed as ""spam"" in their minds.

, All marketing initiatives will take a while to develop traction. If you abandon your dealership advertising every 4 to 6 weeks, you'll always be stuck in that development phase.


If you need to cut back, buy smaller instances of your existing dealership advertising rather than cancelling a specific ad. For example, you can cut a radio spot from 30 seconds to 15, or reduce a newspaper ad from 1/4 page to 1/8 page.

, Make your marketing initiatives going forward based on what has worked in the past.

Perform market research.,
Determine your ideal customer.,
Calculate the size of your market.,
Consider opening a franchise for your business.,
Decide on selling new cars, used cars or both.,
Assess the need for a service department.,
Add up the costs needed to start your car dealership.,
Decide on how you will finance the cost of your dealership.,
Consider the regulatory requirement to start and operate your dealership.",How to Open a Car Dealership," The first step in any business venture is to determine if there is a demand for your product or service. Once you determine the demand, you need to consider how your company might attract some of that customer demand.Determine the number of cars sold in your area. Assume, for example, that the typical car buyer is willing to visit a dealership within 10 miles (16.1 km) of their home. Try to determine the number of cars sold within a 10-mile radius of your proposed car dealership. Assume that 50,000 cars are sold in that area each year.
Once you know the total number of cars, research those purchases by category. For example, how many cars are purchased, compared to trucks? What percentage of the cars sold are new, and how many are used? You may even be able to determine the number of cars by model (Honda, Ford, etc.)
Assess the existing car dealers in the market. Say, for example, that 3,000 new Hondas are sold in your area each year. You’re considering a Honda dealership. How many existing Honda dealers are in your area? Of the Hondas sold, how many were purchased by consumers who went online and bought a new car from a dealership located out of town?
This analysis will help you determine if there is a need for a new dealership in your market.;
, Every business needs to identify their ideal customer. Your ideal customer is a summary of the traits that your best customers have in common. When you identify the ideal customer, you can design your business to meet their needs.Look at the age, gender, occupation and income level of the customers you are trying to attract. Assume that you want to open a Honda dealership. Do some research to determine the type of people who buy a Honda.
You may find that the ideal Honda customer is a male between the ages of 27 and 50 years old. That customer is a white collar professional with an above average level of income. The Honda customer has owned a Honda previously, or has a family member who owns a Honda.
Many car dealers build relationships with customers by selling cars and providing a service department. Some customers go back to the car dealer to get service on their vehicle.
Find out where the ideal Honda customer gets their car serviced. Do they go to their dealership, or to their local repair shop? This information can help you create a service department that will attract customers.

, The goal of your dealership market research is to determine if there is sufficient demand for your product. Ultimately, you need to know the dollar amount of sales for your product, and estimate how much of that customer demand you can attract.Assume that that 3,000 new Hondas are sold in your area each year. You’re also considering selling used Hondas, which generate 2,000 in sales each year. The size of your market is 5,000 Hondas.
Based on your research of existing car dealers and customer demand, you believe that your new dealership can attract 20% of the existing Honda car market. That 20% figure would mean (5,000 new and used car sales multiplied by 20% = 1,000 car sales).
Assume that the average profit per car (considering both new and used) is $500. If your dealership sold 1,000 cars, the business would generate (1,000 cars X $500 = $500,000 in profit). In addition, you estimate that your service department would create a $300,000 profit. The total profit for your dealership would total $800,000.

, Nearly all of the larger car dealerships are franchises. In this arrangement, you are the franchisee who pays a fee to the franchisor. You also sign a franchise agreement to operate your business.

To open your Honda dealership, you would need to complete a long process to become a franchisee. Honda would require you to provide extensive financial disclosures to determine if you have the financial means to open and operate a Honda dealership.
The franchisor (Honda) grants you the right to use the Honda logo and other marketing tools to operate a franchise. You will participate in local advertising and promotion of Honda cars. The franchisor will also agree on a process to supply your dealership with Honda cars.
If you enter into an agreement with a popular car brand, it gives your car dealership credibility in the marketplace. That credibility can help you generate sales. However, the franchise agreement includes many restrictions on how you can advertise and sell their cars. To comply with the franchise agreement, you need to follow the requirements.

, If you sell both new and used cars, you have the opportunity to serve two type of consumers. Selling to both markets, however, will require a larger investment of time and money.If you sell used cars, you will attract customers who want to spend less money on a vehicle. Instead of buying the $25,000 new car, for example, they may buy a $15,000 used car.
Used cars typically require more service and maintenance. As you sell more used cars, you may be able grow your service business.
A growing number of customers shop for cars online. When a customer enters your dealership, they may have checked 4 or 5 dealerships to price a particular car. You may find heavy competition for new car sales, in particular. In order to drive total car sales, you may need a used car sales department.

, Everyone needs to get his or her car serviced eventually. Operating a service department is a great way to build a relationship with a car owner.You can develop relationships with customers who bought their vehicle somewhere else. If you do a great job on their car, they may buy their next car from you.
The need for service on your car can be stressful. It’s inconvenient to be without a car while it is being repaired. Your great customer service can help reduce that anxiety.
After you service someone’s car, stay in touch with the customer. Promote you car sales and service through emails and mailers. Your efforts will increase your chances of selling the customer a car in the future.

, The typical car dealership may require millions of dollars to open and operate. Your biggest cost will be your inventory of cars. Floorplan refers to the cost of the vehicles you have on your car lot. In addition to the cost of your floorplan, you’ll need to buy or lease property. You’ll build or renovate buildings on the property for your showroom and possibly for a repair department.
If you operate a franchise, you will pay the car company an initial franchise fee. Once you’re operating, you’ll pay annual fees for your franchise agreement.
Car dealers also have to constantly train employees on new car features, so that they can explain those features to customers. You incur large costs for training.

, Financing your dealership is a huge commitment. You’ll need to think carefully about how you will find the money to open your dealership.Most car dealerships finance their floorplan through a bank. The cars on the lot serve as collateral for the floorplan loan. A dealership may also incur huge costs to design and build their showroom and repair center.
In addition to car inventory, you may need to hire dozens of employees. You’ll need cash to meet payroll each month.
If you borrow money, you’ll need to provide sufficient collateral for your loan. You may need to pledge personal assets as collateral to obtain your loan. The bank will also need to see detailed financial projections. These projections will explain how your business will generate a profit and repay the bank loan.

, Your state, county or city will have requirements to operate your dealership. Many of these rules are set up to protect the consumers who are making a large investment in buying a car.

Your state will require you to obtain a license to sell cars as your primary business. While individuals can sell cars to each other, a car dealer who sell many cars a year will need a license to operate.
To build your dealership, you will need to get building permits from your city or county.
Your state will require you to have several forms of insurance to operate your dealership. One type of required insurance is a surety bond. This bond is put in place to protect the car buyer from any fraud related to a car purchase.

You may need a permit if you wish to sell alcohol and cigarettes.
Most gas station owners are liable for any gas and spills from underground storage tanks under EPA or other equivalent regulations. Most gas station owners have insurance for these purposes.
You may be required to have liability for customer injury. Many insurance policies are available to business to cover these instances.
You will need to make sure you are not personally financially liable for damages. You may need to consult an attorney to draw up legal contracts.

, If you want to open up a Sunoco or BP station, for example, you would be part of a franchise. A franchise agreement allows a franchisee (you as a business owner) to use the trademark, products, and business models of a larger company.
For example, if you entered into a franchise agreement with Sunoco, you would essentially own a Sunoco station.
Franchisees have to pay royalties to the parent company. This is usually a percentage of sales or a monthly fee.
Most gas stations are part of a franchise agreement.
Before you decide to franchise or sign a specific franchise agreement, you will need to do your research.
Talk to other business owners who have a franchise agreement with the chain you want to open.
Know what you are getting into. Look at a franchise contract to know what your rights and responsibilities are.
Watch out for specifics in your contract. Most franchise agreements benefit the company more than the business owner.
Talk to an attorney or other suitable legal professional to make sure of the legalities of any franchise agreement.

, You will need to include funds for start-up as well as operation.


Your budget plan should definitely include real estate costs: purchasing the land and building costs, or the cost of purchasing an existing gas station.
An estimation of legal costs, such as attorneys' fees for drawing up business contracts and consultations, will need to be included in your budget.
Insurance and permits will be costly and you should include this in your budget estimate.
You will need funds for set-up of your gas station.
Include an estimation of costs for promotions, advertising, and signage.
Make sure you have an estimate of costs of start-up inventory and cash you will need to have on-hand.
Build the costs of gasoline supply and convenience store inventory into your budget. You will need to do research into gas suppliers and store warehouses to see where you can get a cost-efficient contract.
Finally, include an estimation of salaries and employee costs, as well as day to day expenses such as gasoline and utilities. You will need to do research in the industry for standard employee salaries as well as costs of gasoline.

, You will need someone to supply the gas for your station. Different suppliers may offer you different contracts. Basically, a supplier contract stipulates that the supplier will earn a cut of your gas sales.
Typical profit on gas sales for many gas station owners is 8-13 cents per gallon. This varies around the globe.
Don't immediately sign a fuel contract with a local supplier unless you are required to contract with a specific company by your franchise agreement.
It is best to shop around for companies which will offer you the most profit on your gas.
You should have an attorney look over your contract with your fuel supplier to make sure all the agreements are mutually beneficial and will not involve you in a legal loophole.

, Can you think of an area in need of a gas station?Market analysis has shown that one of the top things a consumer thinks about in choosing a gas station is location.
Customers will want a location that is along a major route to work and convenient in terms of traffic patterns.
Think about the set up of your station as well. Customers will want to go to a station that is easy to enter and exit from nearby roadways.

, You will want to avoid an area that is already saturated with gas stations. Look into areas where there is a lot of growth, such as around major cities. As new neighborhoods and business districts crop up, there will be a demand for new gas stations.
Research the locations of big-box retailers such as Sam's Club which offer steep gas discounts.
You will want to place your gas station a distance away from these places to avoid the competition.
Consider hiring a modeler to work with you. Many companies exist for site modeling. These professionals will help you build a digital model of your gas station at the site you are planning.
This can help you decide whether or not your design is feasible at the location and if there is too much competition nearby.

, Your presence along a key interstate or street will draw in customers. If your site is close to an interstate or major highway exit, consider investing in advertising signage along that route to increase your business.
Take into consideration the flow of traffic during different times of the day.
You will want your gas station to be on the same side of the road as heavy traffic during peak times.

, You will want to avoid opening a new business along a route affected by long-term construction.


Customers will try to avoid highways and roads with heavy construction.
If there is a plan for long-term construction at or near your location, consider purchasing a different lot.
Even short-term construction projects can impede your business. Remember, your goal is to get lots of customer traffic near your gas station.

, There may be local restrictions or fees associated with opening this type of business. Check the history of the site you are considering.
If you are purchasing an existing gas station, be aware of any spills or leaks that occurred in the past. You could be held liable by local or state laws for any future complications.
If you are purchasing an existing station, check if you are held to the gas supplier contract for that site. Some places have laws that will bind you to an existing agreement.

, You will need to collect the following types of documents in some countries:A copy of your detailed business plan.
Three years of tax returns (both personal and business)
Supplier Agreements (for gas and convenience store items)
Business Interim Financial Statements
Inventory Schedule
AR/AP Schedules
Franchise Agreements
Budget for operating and start-up costs

, The market is becoming very competitive and costs are going up.This is why having a fully researched business plan is essential.
Your location will have to be ideal for being a successful gas station.
Your budget will need to be a realistic and detailed explanation of funds needed.
You may have to visit several banks and financial companies before your plan is accepted.
Understand that you may have to modify your business plan according to investor suggestions.

, These are often the easiest to obtain. Gas stations come with a lot of environmental and other real-estate valuation concerns.
Often times, SBA loans can cover costs of environmental issues or re-appraisals.
Other banks can provide similar loans, but lenders suggest it is often easier to obtain financing for purchasing an existing gas station rather than building a new one.

, If you cannot get enough start up funds from a loan from the better business bureau, you can try for a more traditional business loan.Make an appointment with a loan officer from a bank.
Show him/her your business plan for your gas station.
Fill out any forms and bring any documentation with you such as tax returns, identification, legal contracts etc.
Apply at several banks. Your credit history, tax information, and viability of your business plan will all be factors in getting your loan.
Different banks may offer you different interest rates on your loan with more or less flexibility for repayment.
Carefully weigh the pros and cons of each offer you get and decide accordingly.

, Decide on these before you officially open.


You may have to research when the busiest traffic times are.
If none of the other gas stations nearby are open late, consider having late night hours. Consider becoming a 24 hour gas station if there is a market for business after midnight.
Always open promptly at the set time. Customers will not want to wait for opening.

, Make sure they understand all aspects of their job.


You will want employees who will show up on time for their shifts.
Schedule your employee shifts to allow for ample coverage during the entire business day.
Have a store manager on duty for all shifts.

, You should inventory all cigarettes, lottery tickets, and money orders at the end of every business day.


Put in inventory orders in a timely manner. If you are constantly out of supplies in your convenience store, customers will complain or be less likely to shop at your business.
Consider how long it takes your vendors to make deliveries. Plan ahead and order popular items well in advance.
Run inventory and cash reports at the end of every business day. Keep a ledger with this information so you can keep an eye on losses.
Deposit cash to the bank every day.

, While most gas stations operate without many incidents, accidents and robberies do occur.


Keep only small amounts of cash in your registers.
Install a drop safe for employees to deposit cash from their registers.
Clear your drop safes at the end of every business day and deposit cash to the bank.
Install shatter proof glass windows.
Consider a 24 hour security system with cameras.

, The location you work will be quite noisy due to the constant buzz of machinery.If you prefer working outdoors or in a more contemplative environment, you might want to look elsewhere for work.


Besides the irritating noise, you should also be prepared to deal with dust and fumes caused by painting or sanding. Be sure to follow all relevant health and safety protocols when painting or sanding, since the debris can cause respiratory issues.

, You will also have to manipulate heavy auto parts and equipment. If you do not wish to engage in strenuous activity, becoming an auto body repair tech might not be right for you.

, For instance, in order for a technician to restore a unibody vehicle to its original form, you must be able to follow instructions and diagrams, either in print form or digitally, and make precise measurements to ensure accurate placement of vehicle body sections relative to one another.


Technicians must be detail oriented.
Strong skills in geometry and art might help.

If you prefer to talk to a person, you can call the airline directly, or use a travel agent. Once the ticket is purchased, you will receive an email confirmation with the option to either print your ticket at home or link it to your phone. You can also print your ticket at the airport.If using an online site, remember that not all airlines are represented. To find the prices and schedules for these airlines, such as Southwest Airlines, you will have to go to their individual websites.;
, You will need to show a current photo ID card when you check in and again when you move through security. Check the airline website for a list of acceptable forms of ID. If you are flying internationally, you will need a passport, which is always accepted as proof of identification.If traveling internationally, be sure to find out if additional travel documents are needed. Some countries require visas that take several weeks to process., Most airlines charge a fee for every bag you need to check, usually starting at about $25 for the first bag and going up to more than $100 for additional bags. They will also charge additional fees for a bag weighing too much, usually more than 50 lbs. To avoid these fees, pack as lightly as possible..


If you can fit everything into one carry-on bag and one personal item, such as a purse or small backpack, you can usually avoid luggage fees altogether.
Check the airline website for restrictions on what can be brought onboard in carry-on luggage. The primary restriction is that all liquids, gels, pastes, etc. need to be in 3.4 oz. (100 ml.) or smaller containers, and all your liquid containers need to fit into a clear, quart bag., If you are driving, check the airport website to get information on where to park. Give yourself extra time if you are taking a cab or Uber for the driver to arrive at your pick-up spot. Confirm train or bus schedules if you are taking public transportation. You do not want to add the stress of being late to your already hectic day., Before leaving the house, determine where you need to go at the airport to check in. You can usually find this information on the airport website. If it is not there, you will see signs as you drive up to the airport complex that will direct you to the right terminal.

If you are parking in an economy lot away from the terminals, the airport will typically run a free shuttle to and from the terminal. Be sure to write down where your car is parked. All airport parking lots look alike, and it is easy to forget where you parked.
If you are taking public transportation, check where you need to get off, and where you will pick it up again on your return.

, Most airlines will not allow you on the flight if you are not checked in at least 30 minutes before the scheduled departure.If you only have carry-on luggage, you can save some time at the airport by checking in online at home or from your phone. You will then be able to skip the check-in counters at the airport and go directly to security.

, Follow the signs to the check-in area for your airline. Most airlines now have self-serve kiosks. Have your flight confirmation number ready, and follow the directions on the kiosk screen. The kiosk will print your boarding pass. Depending on the airline, it might also print a luggage tag.


If the kiosk prints a luggage tag, follow directions to tag your luggage and take it to the luggage drop-off area. If it the kiosk does not print a luggage tag, an airline agent will call your name to come up to the desk to get your tag. Have your photo ID and ticket ready to show them.Some airlines have curbside check-in. This can be a good solution if you have a lot of bags or are short on time. Be sure to tip the curbside agent.

, After checking in, follow the signs for security. When you reach the front of the line, show the TSA agent your photo ID and boarding pass. Once these items are verified, grab a plastic bin and move to the conveyer belt. Put your shoes, belongings and bag of liquids in the bin. Use a second bin if the first becomes too crowded. Use a separate bin for your laptop.Most times and at most airports, the security process will take less than 20 minutes — sometimes much less. At some airports, however, especially around holiday times, it can take 45 minutes or more — sometimes much more — to get through security. Be patient. This is why you arrived early.
Each country has its own security procedures, but all involve showing a photo ID and having your belongings scanned. If the system isn’t clear, airport personnel are always willing to help you get through them correctly. Don’t be afraid to ask if you have a question.

, Check the electronic displays to find your flight and gate number. Gates sometimes change, and the electronic boards will have the most updated information. Follow the signs to get to your gate.


If you are early, feel free to wander into nearby stores or restrooms, but don’t go too far. You don’t want to miss the boarding call.

, Airlines have specific boarding procedures. Check your ticket to find out your boarding number or zone. Wait for your number or zone to be called. The gate agents will explain the exact process before everyone starts boarding. Other passengers are also usually happy to help you navigate the system.

If you are flying domestically, you will only need to present your boarding pass to the gate agent after your zone is called. If you are flying internationally, you might also be asked to show your passport, as well as any needed visas, at this time.

, Seat numbers are located above each row. Find your seat and put your carry-on bag in the overhead bin nearest your seat. Put smaller items under the seat in front of you..


As a courtesy to other passengers, airlines ask that you only put one item in the overhead bin so there is room for everyone.
If the overhead bins have filled before you board, you can put your carry-on under the seat in front of you, if it fits, or have the flight attendant check it. There will be no charge if it is checked.

, Once you have placed your bag in the overhead bin, take your seat and fasten your seat belt. If you are in a middle or window seat, you might have to ask someone who is already seated in your row to move into the aisle so you can get in. That’s OK. Everyone expects to do that.

, The flight attendants will begin a safety demonstration after all the passengers are seated. Listen carefully and familiarize yourself with the procedures. It’s extremely unlikely that anything will happen, but it’s good to know what to do if it does.Even if the fasten seat belt sign is off, it’s a good idea to keep your belt fastened whenever you are seated. The pilot will normally let you know if the plane is entering a turbulent area, but sometimes there will be an unexpected rough patch. Don't worry about a few bumps. Airplanes are built to handle turbulence., Once you are air borne, the flight attendants will begin food and drink service. Most airlines provide free non-alcoholic beverages. Depending on the length of your flight, you might also have the option of purchasing meals, beer and other alcoholic drinks.If you know you are going to want to eat on the plane, bring your own food. You can bring it from home if it doesn’t contain liquids, or purchase it at the airport.
Most airlines now provide in-seat entertainment, so you can watch movies and other shows while flying.
Many airlines now provide under-seat power ports to encourage passengers to bring their own tablets and laptops for their entertainment. You will also often be able to connect to a wifi system for an extra fee.

, Toward the end of the flight, the crew will make announcements to prepare everyone for landing. They will ask that large electronic devices be put away, and they will clear up any trash you might have., After the airplane has landed, stay in your seat until the plane reaches its gate. When the plane is at the gate and stopped, the pilot will turn off the seat belt sign. Now is the time to unbuckle your seat belt., The front rows will leave the plane first, followed in turn by each following row. When it is your row’s turn, stand up, collect your bag from the overhead bin, and proceed down the aisle and out the door.

While you are waiting for your turn, check to make sure you have everything you brought on. You will not be allowed to get back on the plane to get your phone if you leave it in the seat pocket.

, Follow signs for baggage claim. Once in the area, there will be large electronic screens to guide you to the correct claim conveyor belt, where you can find your bags."
"

Be qualified.,

Prepare for Emergencies: Reading and understanding the aircraft’s POH can be essential in recovering from a bad situation.,

Plan your flight: Flight planning has a fairly unvarying process, though the results and information will be unique every time.,

Perform a Walkaround: The pilot of any flight should be thoroughly aware of the airplane’s condition, and must bring anything of concern to the mechanic, or instructor on site.,

Preflight: It’s common to have everything planned out and ready to go, and then have the weather to start to sink.,

Take-off: A pilot should avoid intersection take-offs.,

Know your duties In-flight: A pilot has three priorities when they are flying: to aviate, navigate, and communicate – and in that order.,

Prepare for Arrival: Prior to arriving at the destination, the pilot has several things to think about and coordinate.,

Land: Landing is a critical point in any flight.,

Shutdown: The flight was successful, and everyone is safe.",How to Plan and Perform a VFR Flight," Before flying: Before flying, a pilot must be qualified and hold the proper licenses, or have a flight instructor lined up. Though excitement may get the best of a pilot, s/he must carefully review the Pilot Operating Handbook (POH), obtain a weather briefing to ensure the entire duration of the flight will be within VFR minima, and review the procedures for problematic situations in-flight. Every pilot should plan for accurate food rations, survival gear, and appropriate clothing for the outside conditions, including life jackets (if going beyond gliding distance from shore).
, It’s much easier to follow steps already memorized than to shuffle through the book in panic. Safety is paramount! Ensure you are familiar with the procedures with regards to engine failure during take-off, engine failure in cruise, rough engine, uncertain of position, being lost, fires, electrical failures, etc., A pilot needs to calculate the plane’s gross weight and recognize if the centre of gravity is within limits. This will change the airplane’s performance; an improperly balanced plane is an impending accident. Navigation for VFR flights are suited with VNC (VFR Navigation Chart) and VTA (VFR Terminal Area Chart) maps, with indications for gravel pits, golf courses, waterfalls etc., for location reference, as well as airspace information, terrain elevation, and airport information. VTAs are larger scale maps, giving more detail on arrival, and departure procedures. A pilot shall check out any outstanding NOTAMs (Notices to Airmen), prepare a chart and flight log, file a flight plan, and ensure s/he will have sufficient daylight on arrival (without night rating)., The walkaround gives the pilot an opportunity to check for any sort of tainted exterior surfaces; being bugs, ice, frost, dirt, etc, as well as fuel and oil checks. The importance of determining the airworthiness of an airplane cannot be underestimated; frost on the wings of an airplane alone can lower the lift efficiency by 30% and increase drag by 40%. Walkaround checks include draining fuel samples to check for contamination, ensuring there’s an adequate amount of fuel for the flight, as well as checking for the quantity of oil in the engine. Every aircraft has a checklist for the walkaround, starting inside the cockpit ensuring all paperwork, first-aid, fire extinguisher, etc. are there and intact. Lastly, the pilot checks that foamies, “Remove Before Flight” tags, and tie-downs, are detached., Get a current weather report. A professional, responsible pilot will realize that if the conditions aren’t right, you don’t fly! Be patient for calmer days. During the preflight stage, the pilot shall check to have the aircraft operating manual, log, charts, computer, pencils, survival equipment, clothing and sunglasses in the aircraft. Now that the groundwork is done, the pilot may call ATC (Air Traffic Control) for a transponder code (transmission-responder) for airplane recognition on radar screens. Passengers may be briefed at this point as well., Many runways require an airplane to “backtrack” onto, to make use of the entire length of the runway. Keep lift-off speeds and engine failure procedures in your mind, and have an abort location about halfway down the runway if all systems aren’t a go at that point. Check that the engine sounds good, and the propeller is rotating at full power. Read and complete the checklists, ensure temperature and pressure gauges are showing good readings. If there is an Air Traffic Control (ATC) unit, the pilot must request clearance for take-off. Always use the centre line of the runway, and devote all attention to the task at hand., Once settled in a cruise flight attitude, a pilot should read his/her map and follow it to the ground, anticipating landmarks as outlined. With VFR flight, a pilot must stay below 500’ from the cloud base (in controlled airspace), so as to have clear visual contact at all times. On a cross-country flight, the pilot or co-pilot should be calculating the fuel burn and ground speed, as per the pre-flight plan. When the tanks are down to 30 minutes of flight time during the day, or 45 minutes at night, the pilot should plan to land and refuel., About twenty minutes before landing, the pilot should review the Canada Flight Supplement (CFS) to reconfirm the airport information (circuit height, elevation, runway lengths and heading), and review the approach speeds, crosswind limit, and flap settings. About ten minutes before, the pilot shall broadcast their current location, intentions, and get the local traffic information. If there are several airplanes arriving, ATC will let the pilot know of their sequence number for landing. Between five and ten minutes prior to landing, the pilot should set the altimeter to the reporting station's pressure, check surface winds, and continue to look for other traffic. If the crosswinds are over the limits, the pilot should land elsewhere. Landing lights will be switched on, and at this point the pilot may join the circuit after reporting. Checking the windsock is important, so the aircraft is landing into the wind for sufficient engine cooling, and greatest drag., Pilots must be able to recognize where the airplane will land, from the point at which s/he is in the air presently. When undershooting or experiencing turbulence, add power early. Check and recheck the windsock as the aircraft gets closer to the runway, and review the overshoot procedure. It’s safer to go around again or ask for an alternate, than to have a bad landing! Line up with the white centre line of the runway, and stay lined up during the approach, touchdown and rollout. Plan to have the airplane touch down by the first third of a paved runway, first quarter if grass. Apply brakes right away if required; a small aircraft may be able to roll itself out to a slow on the remaining runway length., Passengers must remain seated until the prop(s) have stopped. The pilot has the responsibility to close the flight plan as soon as possible, so Search and Rescue (SAR) doesn’t get alarms telling them the aircraft hasn’t arrived on time. Also, make sure the Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) hasn't activated; hard landings may have the ELT go off without there being an accident or reason to investigate. If the plane is low in fuel, it is of common courtesy to refuel it for the next flight. It also helps eliminate water accumulation in the wing tanks, keeping the fuel pure. Lastly, the pilot should tie-down the plane, put in wheel chocks, insert foamies and replace “Remove Before Flight” tags."

Control Bank.,
Control Pitch.,
Control Yaw.,
Multi-task and use small corrections.,
Controlling Airspeed Using Trim.,
Be Patient.,
Going Up.,
Going Down.,
Maintain Level.",How to Maintain a Straight and Level Flight when Flying a Plane," Use the Control wheel or stick to control the bank of the airplane. If the airplane is in a bank to the right rotate the wheel (or push the stick) to the left to level the wings. Vice versa if the airplane is banked to the left. It is difficult to tell if the airplane is banked by looking forward. Look at the wingtips to determine if the airplane is banked. When both wing tips are equal distant from the horizon your wings are level.
, Pushing forward on the control wheel or stick will move the nose down and pulling will move the nose up. Pick a point on the windshield to hold the horizon. Make sure the wings are still level from the previous step. If the wings are not level this can affect your perspective of pitch especially if you are not sitting in the middle of the airplane such as in side by side seating., Use the rudder pedals to control yaw. If you feel that you are sliding to the left in your seat step on the left rudder pedal, and if you feel you are sliding to the right step on the right rudder pedal . You should feel as if you are getting pushed straight down through the seat at all times! Most airplanes have a small ball on the instrument panel known as inclinometer. There is saying ""step on the ball"" which means if the ball is on the left apply more left rudder pedal pressure and if it is on the right apply more right rudder pedal pressure. Many airplanes will require at least little bit of constant pressure on one pedal (even in straight and level flight) or another so it might help to try to keep only one foot on the rudder pedals at any one time, and vary the amount of pressure on that pedal., Once you are able to do all of the above at the same time it's time to move on to the next tasks. Also, make small corrections. Small corrections means that even if the airplane is not exactly where you want it as long as its getting there don't add in any more additional control inputs. After you have developed some skill then you can become more aggressive., For a given pitch attitude (where the horizon is on the windshield) and power setting (the throttle position) there will be a corresponding airspeed. While either power or pitch can be used to control airspeed, airspeed can be controlled more accurately with the use of pitch. To increase speed, pitch down. To decrease speed, pitch up. You will find to hold a specific pitch attitude you may need to hold considerable force on the stick use the trim to relieve these forces. If you feel that you are constantly holding the nose up use some nose up trim. If you feel you are constantly holding the nose down use nose down trim. Don't be afraid of the trim use as much or as little as you want. When you are trimmed correctly it should feel as if the nose would not move if you were to let go of the control wheel or stick., After making a pitch change it will take a few seconds for the airplane to accelerate. Lower the nose, wait, check the airspeed, make another SMALL correction, wait, check the airspeed. As the airspeed changes you will also need to make trim changes too., If you are below the desired altitude add some power (increase throttle). You will need to establish a higher pitch attitude to maintain the airspeed. If it looks like you are climbing you do not need to do anything more as long as you are moving to your desired altitude., If you are too high reduce power. You will need to lower the pitch attitude again to maintain airspeed. Remember only change the power enough to get you moving in the right direction., Maintain level flight by ""tweaking"" the power ever so slightly so that the airplane does not climb or descend."
"
Know what the basics are.,
Get a medial certificate.,
Choose a flight school and flight instructor.,
Take responsibility for your own flight training


Once you've settled on the flight school and instructor, make sure you schedule your lessons frequently and spend at least a couple hours a day studying and reviewing your flight training material.",How to Learn to Fly," Before learning to fly, you should know things like:


Different types of pilot certificatesDifferent types of medical requirements and certificates
Different types of flight schools and flight instructors
Costs of taking flight lessons and earning your certificate;
, In the US, you can get 1st, 2nd, or 3rd Class medicals.To keep things simple, just remember this:


If you ever want to get paid to fly, get a 1st Class medical.
If you don't qualify for a 1st Class, get a 2nd class, but you will be limited to the type of pilot jobs.
If you're not interested in getting paid to fly and just want to fly for fun, get a 3rd Class medical.

,


It's extremely important to choose the right flight school and flight instructor for you. There are several types of flight schools out there and they're divided into two major groups: Part 61 and Part 141.
Although they might operate slightly differently, you still get the same exact pilot certificates from both types of schools. The major difference is the pace of the flight training that you will get. For the most part, part 61 schools are ""go-at-your-own-pace"" type of flight schools. Although this might sound nice, you should be careful that your flight training doesn't ""drag out"" costing you thousands of extra dollars.
Part 141 schools, on the other hand are more structured and aimed to student pilots who want to get their certificates done as fast as possible. This might sound intimidating, but in the end, you are still the customer and can choose to go at the pace that you need. Finishing flight training in a timely manner will also save you thousands of dollars and months, or even years of frustration.
For the best flight training experience, make sure you choose a compatible certified flight instructor (CFI). You will be spending a lot of time sitting right next to this person, so you want to make sure that you two are a good match. When talking to potential flight instructors, ask about their teaching styles and whether they use a syllabus. If they don't use a syllabus, find another instructor, as this is a big red flag. Also, make sure they don't talk down to you or make you feel uncomfortable in any way.

, You have to prepare for a written exam, an oral exam, learn how to plan cross country flights, etc. Don't be lazy and ask a lot of questions.

"
"
Establish your objectives for learning how to fly.,
Make a list of all the characteristics you are looking for in a flight school.

,
Decide whether you are looking for a specific certification, a professional pilot program or an internship program.

,
Research flight school directories, and make a list of all the flight schools you would be interested in attending based on location.,
Take your time to read through the informational packets.,
Narrow your choice of flying schools down to 5.,
Visit the 5 flying schools of your choice.,
Request a meeting with the admissions administrator.,
Be prepared for each meeting.,
Decide if the school leaves a good impression.,
Review the remaining schools in your list.",How to Pick a Flight School," Decide whether you want to make a career out of flying or if you just want to fly for pleasure.


If you want a career as a pilot, look for a flight school with several airplanes and full time flight instructors. These tend to be more structured and will get you done sooner than some of the more laid back type of schools.
If you want to fly just for fun and go at your own pace, you can choose a more relaxed-style type school. But, you may end up paying more money overall, since the longer you take the more money you will pay.
If you are going to be working on your commercial pilot certificate, strongly consider a Part 141 School versus a Part 61 school since you will only be required to log 190hrs of flight time if getting your commercial pilot training from a Part 141 School instead of the 250hrs if you are training at a Part 61 School.;
,,, Review the schools on your list online. Get an idea of each school's accreditation, programs, facilities, safety record and anything else that you feel is important in an aviation school search. Narrow your list down to no more than 8 flight schools, if possible, and request information from all of them, including the training syllabus you are interested in.

, Write notes comparing the positives and negatives of each school. Base your feedback on the characteristics that you consider significant when attending a flight school. Make notes of the bonus features at each school also, as these may be the determining factors if you are having a hard time choosing. You should jot down questions about things not mentioned or confusing.

, Use the process of elimination in your selection, based on your notes.

, This way you can put yourself in the environment of each school and meet the people you may be spending time with. Arrange a tour of the campus and flight department.

, If financial aid is a requirement, make arrangements to meet that administrator also. You can also arrange to meet with a flight instructor and interview the current students during the tour.

, You should bring your written list of questions. If additional questions come up during the meeting, write them down. Your goal is to leave each meeting feeling as if you have a complete picture of what it is like to be a student at the school.

, Determine whether you are still as impressed as you were when you read the school's informational packet. If you are more excited, then the school should be considered a finalist in your decision making. If the feeling is less impressive, then cross the school off your list.

, Look over your list of questions and responses from each flying school. Recall the feelings you got during each visit. Compare all your remaining schools in this manner and decide which one fulfills your ultimate goals.

This is an international requirement, even if you are getting your license in a country whose official language is not English.English is the international language of aviation, a measure put in place by ICAO, or the International Civic Aviation Organization.;
, Getting your private pilot license is an expensive process. Not only do you have to pay for flying lessons, but most people have to rent a plane to use for lessons which is usually the highest cost. In addition, you have to pay for equipment, fuel and test costs. Total costs for a private pilot’s license in the United States usually run between $8,000 and $13,000. It may vary depending on what country you live in.There are a few things you can do to cut the cost. If you have multiple options of places to take lessons, find lessons at the best value you can.
Buy cheaper or used equipment.
Study hard for your exams so that you don’t fail and have to take them multiple times. Taking the exams costs money so you will save if you pass them the first time.
Another thing is to consider getting a sport license, which requires only 20 training hours. This can save you a few thousand dollars.
If you have a sports license, you can still carry a passenger with you, but there are a few restrictions. These include that you cannot fly at night, and that you have limited aircraft options., Though you can start your training without a medical exam, it’s a good idea to get one straight off the bat. If it turns out that you aren’t eligible to fly, you won’t waste money starting your lessons. You will need to find an Aviation Medical Examiner near you to set up a physical. To be able to fly in the United States, you have to receive at least a third class FAA medical certificate.At the exam, you will be asked your medical history along with any medication you take regularly.
You will get an regular physical exam and be asked to provide a urine sample.
If you are over 40, you will be required to take an EKG, which tests for problems with electrical activity in your heart.
You also will need to pass an eye exam.

, Getting your license will take time, so prepare to be working on it for around six months. Depending on your schedule, clear out at least one day a week during which you can take lessons or study. If you jump into the process without a clear schedule, it’s easy to either get overwhelmed or to lose focus.

, Before taking lessons, decide whether you want to learn to fly an airplane, a helicopter, a hot air balloon or a different type of aircraft. Most new pilots choose to learn to fly an airplane with a single engine, but you have a few different options.

, You want to find an instructor that is experienced at both flying and teaching, and can communicate well. Try to find an instructor who has done more than 3,000 hours of teaching.The easiest way to find an instructor is through a flight school in your area, though some flight instructors do work freelance.
Also be sure to pick an instructor that you feel at ease with. Flying for the first time is nerve-wracking as it is, so you want to find someone who will make you feel relaxed and calm.

, Your flying lessons are the most critical part of your learning process. Different countries vary on the amount of time that you need to train, so check your country’s individual standards by researching on the internet or calling a flight school. No matter what country you are in, you will need to do a certain amount of hours with your instructor, plus night and cross-country flights, as well as solo flights with takeoffs and landings. In the United States, the breakdown is as follows:20 hours of training with an instructor (including 3 hours of cross-country, 3 night hours, and 3 hours of instrument flight training).
10 hours of solo time (including travel to various airports with set amounts of takeoffs and landings.)
Although this only adds up to 30 hours, you need 40 hours in the US to complete training. Most people do more than 40 hours; a good estimate of the average amount of hours people generally do is 60 hours. This is the amount of time that it generally takes to master all the skills you need., Don’t take long breaks between your flying sessions. Even a couple weeks can make you forget what you have learned so that you will have to do more hours to master flying. This will cost you more money and make the entire process longer and more difficult., You will be learning many different aspects of flying. When you learn so much at one time, it can be difficult to retain it all. If there is an aspect of piloting that you feel uncertain about, tell your instructor that you’d like to go over it again. Your instructor is there to help, so don’t be hesitant about asking them to repeat themselves.


Some of the skills and knowledge you will learn are: airport operations, preflight procedures, takeoffs and landings, navigation, flight at various air speeds, stalls, night operations and emergency operations., You will need to study to gain enough knowledge to pass your tests. There are study guides out there for people training to get their private pilot’s license, which is a good way to start. But you should make sure to ask your instructor for good resources.


Your instructor has experience getting people through their training and testing, and may know the best and latest resources out there to help.

, In addition to practicing flight procedures in your lessons, it’s a good idea to study them on your own time. Different people have different ways of learning, and many people benefit from having information presented in several different ways.Reading about what you have been learning in your lessons will reinforce the knowledge so that you will have a better chance of remembering the skills and information.

, To get your private pilot’s license, you have to pass not only a flying test-run, but also a knowledge test. The knowledge test includes a written and oral exam that will test your aeronautical knowledge. Some areas of study you will need to explore are aerodynamics, aircraft systems, aeronautical decision making, how to read weather forecasts and reports, and planning for the unexpected during flights., If you are having a hard time learning all of your “ground knowledge” at home, or are confused about what to study, consider enrolling in a class taught by a flight instructor. This class will be specially formulated for providing the information you need to know to safely fly and also to pass the written test., You can find practice written exams either online or through your school. Taking these tests will let you know what you can expect from the real thing. Score your test, and take note if there is a particular area of study you need to brush up on. Go over this subject before you take the real test.

, When you are confident you are ready, take the written test. In the United States, the written exam has 60 questions and must be completed within two and a half hours. You must get at least a 70% to pass the exam.The written exam is offered in seven different aircraft categories: airplane, helicopter, gyroplane, glider, hot air balloon, gas balloon and ligher-than-air gas ship, depending on what aircraft you have taking lessons on.
The exam usually runs for $90 in the United States., The oral test comes right before you take practical flight exam. For this test, the examiner will give you a specific hypothetical flight route, and ask you plan the details including things like the time enroute, the navigation, the fuel burned, etc. You also will go over aeronautical knowledge that you have studied., After the oral exam, you will be asked to act as pilot in the practical examination. You will be asked to start a cross country flight, then plan a course to a nearby airport. This will test your ability to plan on the spot and improvise, which is an essential part of flying as conditions are constantly changing.No matter what, keep your focus and don’t get distracted. Some examiners may purposefully try to distract you to see if you have the level-headed temperament needed to fly.
The cost of the practical exam in the United States usually run between $300 and $400., Congratulations, you earned your private pilot license! Keep it in the back of your mind that every couple years, you must complete another quick oral exam and check-in. Make sure that the person giving you your license has told you the specifics for maintaining it.

Organize an orientation flight.,
Obtain Student Pilot License and Third Class Medical.,
Organize Your Plan.,
Do your pre-solo flight training.,
Do your post-solo flight training.,
After your instructor signs you off, take the written test which consists of 60 multiple-choice questions and can be taken at FAA testing centers or with licensed test providers.,
After your instructor feels you are ready, complete your final exam or “check ride” accompanied by an FAA-certified examiner who will ask you questions and assess your abilities.,
Receive your private pilot’s license with a visual flight rules rating.",How to Get a Private Pilot’s License (USA)," An orientation flight may be as simple as going to your nearest airport with a flight school. The staff are usually as enthusiastic to get you in an airplane as you are. The orientation flight exposes you to the experience of flying in an airplane and gives you a chance to evaluate yourself on how your body or mind responds (i.e. nausea, fear of heights.) Most of these sensations and symptoms are temporary, but it just depends on your body, determination, and your decision to continue.;
, There is no minimum age requirement to begin flight training, however, you must be at least sixteen to fly solo for an airplane provided you have a license and a medical from a designated Aviation Medical Examiner (AME).



Student Pilot License. To apply, you must comply with 14 CFR 61.83 You must be of the eligible age and read, speak, write and understand the English language.

Third Class Medical. Like the name implies, this is an examination of your physical state by an AME. A list of examiners in your area can be found on the FAA website.

, There are many ways to acquire an aircraft and a Certified Flight Instructor (CFI). You could know a generous aircraft owner and a family friend who happens to be a CFI or finding a local Fixed-Based Operator (FBO) with planes and instructors. Another option in enrolling in an accredited flight training program in a college environment if you are interested in both the license and a degree. There is nearly an infinite number of ways to find a plane and an instructor for you to receive flight training.

, Before your first solo, your CFI will train you to the standards outlined by 14 CFR 61.87. For a single engine land plane, only paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), and (n) apply.



Aeronautical Knowledge. Your CFI will administer a written test and then review the test with you and examine that you are competent to operate the aircraft by yourself. He may cover the physics of flight, the applicable regulations, airspace procedures, weather, landing techniques, aircraft specifications and the like.

Maneuvers and Procedure for Pre-Solo Flight Training. There is a list of maneuvers he is required to at least demonstrate and some to have you perfect. They are specified under 14 CFR 61.87(d) and include pre-flight procedures, taxiing and ground operations, takeoff, turns, stalls, descents, landings, etc.

, After you solo, there are a few major flight training exercises left to complete. At this point, your CFI is now having you fulfill the Aeronautical Experience requirement found under 14 CFR 61.109(a). This is the bare minimum experience needed for a PPL. You must log at least 40 hours of flight time that includes at least 20 hours of flight training from an authorized instructor and 10 hours of solo flight training and it requires at least the following:


3 hours of cross-country flight training in a single-engine airplane.
3 hours of night flight training in a single-engine airplane that includes one cross-country flight of over 100 nautical miles total distance and 10 takeoffs and 10 landings to a full stop (with each landing involving a flight in the traffic pattern) at an airport.

3 hours of flight training in a single-engine airplane on the control and maneuvering of an airplane solely by reference to instruments. This is flying with the human equivalent of horse blinders and a taste of flying under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) as oppose to being under Visual Flight Rules (VFR) as you have previously been experienced with.

3 hours of flight training with an authorized instructor in a single-engine airplane in preparation for the practical test, which must have been performed within the preceding 2 calendar months from the month of the test. This is your practice Practical Exam with your instructor and gives you a chance to work out any bugs.
10 hours of solo flight time in a single-engine airplane with 5 hours of solo cross-country time which includes one solo cross country flight of 150 nautical miles total distance, with full-stop landings at three points, and one segment of the flight consisting of a straight-line distance of more than 50 nautical miles between the takeoff and landing locations and three takeoffs and three landings to a full stop at an airport with an operating control tower.

, (usually at the FBO where you are taking your flight training) You must score at least 70% to pass the written knowledge test

, The exact requirements are contained in an FAA document called the Airman Certification Standards (ACS).

, This allows you to pilot a single-engine aircraft in good visibility during the day or at night as long as you abide by the FARs (federal aviation regulations) pertaining to your license.

Choose the type of aircraft on which you would like to instruct.,
Consider enrolling in a flight instructor training course.,
Call the FAA to schedule a ground instructor or flight instructor examination.,
Apply for jobs as a flight instructor.",How to Become a Flight Trainer," Flight instructors must first be certified pilots before training others. You can enroll in an FAA certified flight school as soon as you are 16.


You will be required to have at least 250 flight hours before you can get your Commercial Pilot Certification. These hours are with a licensed flight instructor. Some other types of flying, such as helicopter, require a lower number of flight hours.;
, All pilots are required to pass a medical examination before being licensed.

, Throughout the career, most pilots apply to receive advanced pilot ratings in order to move up the ranks with their chosen aircraft.

, Although this is not strictly necessary for all types of flight, commercial pilots must have 1,500 hours of commercial flight experience in order to apply to become a flight instructor. It is always a good policy to spend 5 to 10 years working in an industry before becoming a full-time flight instructor.

, Many of the tests are plane specific, such as sport, helicopter, glider, airplane or gyroplane. To become an airplane flight instructor you will need to show flight hours for single and multiple engine aircraft.

, These courses often last approximately 2 months and train you in over 150 hours of ground and flight instruction. These courses will allow you to shadow other instructors and you may be given job placement upon completion.

, Call 800-947-4228 to schedule an examination with the Computer Assisted Testing Service (CATS).


You will be required to take a written test of between 25 and 100 questions.
If you fail a flight instructor test, you may be required to submit a report of your test failure and proof of additional instruction.

, Most instructors begin by teaching ground instruction and then moving on to flight instruction. In some cases, you may be required to write your own instruction course and materials.

Obtain a Class I medical certificate/student pilot certificate.,
Become a professional pilot.,
Have a background in and passion for science.,
Be able to communicate well verbally and in writing.,
Go to test pilot school, or join the military.",How to Become a Test Pilot," Before running off to flight school and spending money on flight training be sure you are physically eligible for a career as a test pilot. If you cannot pass a Class I medical test, you cannot work as a test pilot. Period. This means being off of most if not all medications, never having had an epileptic seizure, never having had internal organ issues - especially with the heart, never having had a history of mental issues involving psychosis, no criminal convictions, no illicit drug use, and a host of other criteria that may be referenced in the FAR/AIM and a number of websites. Your first Class I medical certificate may be dual-issued with a student pilot certificate.;
, Find your nearest FAR Part 141 ground school and enroll in flight training. Part 141 is preferred to Part 61 because of its more stringent testing criteria. Aircraft certificates from private pilot to airline transport pilot (ATP) are required as well as instrument and multi-engine ratings. In addition a variety endorsements and type ratings may be obtained in order to expand a test pilot's resume. Proficient and safe operating habits and good ""stick and rudder"" skills are a must.

, Most if not all aircraft manufacturers require an advanced degree in aeronautical engineering for test pilot applicants. This means starting early with mathematics and physics courses in high school and obtaining a bachelor's and master's degree in aeronautical engineering, or a bachelor's in mathematics or physics with a minor in engineering and a master's in aeronautical engineering. Expect a minimum of 6 years in a university and a lot of hard work. If your goal is to enter the military, talk to officer recruiters and join your university ROTC program.

, Test pilots spend as much time planning their test flights and reporting on how the plane handled after flying it as they do actually flying planes. They work with engineers before the flight and are often called upon to make suggestions to improve a plane's design during its development phase based on the results of their test flights. You need to be able to understand and use the correct terminology in oral and written reports and engineering papers.

,


At this point, being a professional pilot and an aeronautical engineer you stand an excellent chance of obtaining a pilot slot in the Marines, Navy, or Air Force. Just be aware that the cut-off age for military pilot entrance is typically 27 years. While at your university you should be in communication with local officer recruiters and be sure to fulfill their criteria - which typically includes GPA requirements as well as physical fitness tests (being able to pass the naval flight physical is a must if entering the Marines or the Navy).
Going the civilian route is more difficult. A test pilot certificate from the National Test Pilot School costs around $500,000. For the average person still deep in college debt this is impossible. To become a purely civilian test pilot you must find a company to sponsor your entrance into test pilot school. Be on your best behavior, be sociable, and never burn bridges because the aviation community is a very small place. Network as much as possible and make sure you cultivate the image of a determined, safe, and brilliant pilot and eventually you will find the connection and sponsorship you are looking for. Go to conventions where you can meet other pilots in the industry - including test pilots. Shake hands, talk goals, and exchange email addresses. These connections are extremely valuable and can give you tips on company openings and requirements in order to land a seat at test pilot school.

Airports usually have a Fixed Base Operator (FBO).,
If no one has recommended a CFI, the school will assign one to you.,
Some questions you might want to ask the CFI:


What is your schedule and general availability?,
After the first couple of flights you (and your CFI) will start to get a feel for how the training is going.,
Flight schools are authorized by the FAA to operate under two sets of regulations known as FAR part 141, or part 61 (the FBO will tell you or ask) Many schools can offer you a choice.,
If you are are with a part 141 school you will normally fly with one CFI.,
The training under part 61 is less structured in some ways, but can be more suitable for some students.",How to Choose a Flight Instructor," Larger general aviation airports may have several to choose from. The FBO usually hosts (or may own) a flight school. Flight schools have Certified Flight Instructors (CFI's) and training aircraft for rent.;
, (see introduction above)

,
What is your training philosophy?
What is your billing policy? What is your cancellation policy?

, Ask yourself if you feel the CFI is: too laid back, too stern, genuinely concerned about your learning, or distracted. Hey, it's your money! If it doesn't feel right have a discussion with your instructor, or request another CFI.

, There are advantages to both.

, Periodically, you'll have what are called Stage Checks. Stage Checks are done with a different CFI. This is to ensure you are progressing in accordance with the training syllabus.

, It depends on your situation and what your aviation goals are. Your CFI and/or your school will be able to help you decide which course is best for you.

Select a qualified flight school with certified flight instructors.,
Obtain a certificate from a doctor that proves you are fit to fly.,
Pay the flight school's tuition.",How to Attend Flight School,"


The particular government entity that mandates requirements for obtaining a pilot's license may also have a school locator that can help you begin the selection process. The United States agency, the Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, has such a tool.
Different licenses are available depending on the type of aircraft you wish to fly and whether you will fly professionally or recreationally. A PPL is the designation for a private pilot's license according to the Joint Aviation Authority, or JAA, which governs flight schools in European countries. According to the JAA, the ""JAA-FCL 1"" is the general term for rules regarding an aeroplane license; ""JAA-FCL 2,"" specifies the criteria for a helicopter license. Similarly, the FAA also has licenses for private and recreational pilots.
The school that you select must have a flight instructor with the knowledge and certifications to train you for the appropriate license. For example, in order to become an air transport pilot, the school should have an instructor with such a license.;
, In some countries, a doctor must perform the examination at specific facilities.


The JAA certifies authorized medical examiners (AMEs) to provide assessments. AMEs are located throughout the JAA member-states, and are often simply physicians in hospitals and clinics.
The CAA, or Civil Aviation Authority, in Great Britain mandates that commercial pilots undergo an initial medical examination at the United Kingdom CAA Aeromedical Centre (AMC) at Gatwick airport in West Sussex. The examination takes around half a day to complete.
The FAA requires you to see an Aviation Medical Examiner, or AME. You can find an AME in your area by visiting the FAA's website.

, There are several variables that determine your total tuition cost.


While the FAA requires a minimum of 40 hours of flight time to become a private pilot, the number of hours that it takes you may vary by state. However, many training facilities note that 55 hours of flying is more realistic.
Many schools suggest that students take at least two classes a week, which correlates to finishing in 6 months.
Unlike paying for a semester of tuition in a lump sum at a traditional university, you can pay for lessons as you take them. Some schools may offer discounts if you pay for several classes at a time, and some schools offer financing.

Come to a stop.",How to Fly an Airplane," Before taking off, it's important to perform a walk-around examination called a ""pre-flight."" This is a visual inspection of the aircraft to verify that the airplane components are in good working order. Your instructor should provide you with a highly useful operating checklist for the specific plane and this checklist will tell you exactly what to do in each phase of flight, even pre-flight. The basics of pre-flight:



Check control surfaces. Remove any control locks and make sure your ailerons, flaps, and rudder are moving freely and smoothly.

Visually check your fuel tanks and oil. Make sure they're filled to the specified levels. To check the fuel level, you'll need a clean fuel measuring rod. To check oil, there's a dipstick in the engine compartment.

Check for fuel contaminants. This is done by draining a small amount of fuel into a special glass container tool, and looking for water or dirt in the fuel. Your instructor will show you how.

Fill out a weight and balance sheet which helps ensure that you are not flying outside the capabilities of your airplane. Your instructor will show you how.

Look for nicks, dings, and any other type of body damage. These small imperfections might inhibit your aircraft's flying ability, especially if the prop is compromised. Always check props before an engine start. Use caution around airplane props. - If there are electrical issues with the plane, the prop could turn over unexpectedly, causing severe injury.

Check emergency supplies. Although it is not pleasant to think about, prepare for the worst. - There is always the possibility of something going wrong with the aircraft. Make sure there is a supply of food, water, and first aid items. Also ensure that you have an operating radio, flashlight, and batteries. A weapon may be needed along with standard repair parts for the plane.;
, When you take your seat in the cockpit, all of the systems and gauges will look complicated, but they'll look much simpler once you become familiar with what they do. In front of you will be a flight control that looks like a modified steering wheel.


This control, more commonly called the yoke, works like a steering wheel in a car. It controls the pitch of the nose (up or down) and banking of the wings. Get a feel for the yoke. Push to go down, pull to go up, and use left and right to roll, unsurprisingly, left and right. Don't use too much force when flying. - It doesn't take much to control the plane.

, They are usually located between the two seats in the cockpit. The throttle is black, and the mixture knob is red. In General Aviation, they are usually just push/pull knobs.


Thrust is controlled by the throttle and the mixture knob adjusts the fuel-to-air ratio (lean or rich in gas).

, On most aircraft, there are six primary flight instruments located along two horizontal rows. These indicators are often referred to as the six pack and show, among other things, altitude, attitude (orientation of the aircraft relative to Earth's horizon), compass heading, and speed—both forward and up or down (rate of climb).


Top left - The ""Airspeed Indicator"" shows aircraft airspeed, usually in knots. (A knot is one nautical mile per hour—about 1.15 MPH or 1.85km/h).
Top center - The ""Artificial Horizon"" shows the aircraft attitude, that is, whether the plane is climbing or descending and how it is banking - left or right.
Top right - The ""Altimeter"" shows the height (altitude) of the aircraft, in feet MSL—feet above mean, or average, sea level.
Lower left - The ""Turn and Bank Indicator"" is a dual instrument which tells how fast you are changing the compass heading (rate of turn) and also whether you are in co-ordinated flight, This is also called the ""Turn and Slip Indicator"" or ""Needle Ball.""
Lower center is the ""Heading Indicator"" which shows your aircraft current compass heading. This instrument should be calibrated (usually every 15 minutes). To calibrate, adjust the instrument to agree with the compass. This is done on the ground or, if in flight, only in straight and level flight.
Lower right is the ""Vertical Speed Indicator"" which tells how fast you are climbing or descending in feet per minute. Zero means that you are maintaining altitude and are neither climbing nor descending.

, Many small planes have fixed gear, in which case you will not have a landing gear control knob. For airplanes that do have a landing gear control, the location varies, but it usually has a white rubber handle. You will be using this after you take off and before you land and taxi the plane. It may deploy any non-fixed landing gear—wheels, skis, skids, or floats beneath.

, These are a set of pedals at your feet used to control the rudder which is attached to the vertical stabilizer. When you want to make minor adjustments to go left or right on the ‘’vertical’’ axis, use the rudder pedals. Basically, the rudder controls the yawing aspect of turning the aircraft. Turning on the ground is also controlled by the rudder pedals and/or the brakes, not by the yoke.

, If you are at a controlled airport you must contact Ground Control before taxiing. They will give you further information as well as a transponder code, commonly called a ""squawk code."" Be sure to write this down, as this information must be repeated to Ground Control before you are given clearance for takeoff. Once given clearance, proceed to the runway as directed by Ground Control, making sure to never cross any runway unless you are cleared to do so.

, Usually 10 degrees of flaps are used to help increase lift. Check your aircraft manual, though. - Some aircraft do not use flaps for takeoff.

, Before you reach the runway, stop at the run-up area. You'll have to perform the engine run-up procedure here. This helps insure that your aircraft is ready to fly safely.


Ask your instructor to show you this procedure.

, After completing a successful run-up, notify the tower and wait to be cleared to continue to and/or enter the runway.

, Push the fuel mixture knob completely in and advance the throttle slowly. This will increase the engine RPMs (revolutions per minute), generating thrust and the airplane will start to move. Note, though, that the plane will want to go left when you do this, so add proper rudder to stay on the runway centerline.


If there's a crosswind, you will need to turn the yoke, carefully, into the wind. As you pick up speed, slowly decrease this correction.
You'll need to control the yaw (twisting on a vertical axis) with the rudder pedals. If the plane starts doing twisting, use the foot pedals to control it.

, In order to take off into the air, the plane needs to achieve a certain speed to create enough lift. The throttle should be full on in most aircraft, though some will have a maximum setting to reduce over torquing. You will gradually build enough airspeed to become airborne (usually around 60 knots for small planes). The airspeed indicator will tell you when you have reached this speed.


When the plane gets enough lift, you’ll notice the nose lifting off the ground a bit. Pull gently back on the flight control, being sure to maintain the proper climb rate for the particular aircraft.

, This will cause the whole airplane to leave the runway and rise into the air.Remember to maintain climb speed and apply proper rudder.
When at a safe height above the ground and you have a positive rate of climb as indicated by the VSI (Vertical Speed Indicator), return the flaps and landing gear to neutral position. This will reduce drag and extend the safe flying time and distance.

, This will keep the plane level. If you fall below the artificial horizon, pull back to raise the nose of the airplane, lifting it. Again, be gentle. - It doesn't need much.


The best way to keep the plane at the right altitude is making sure you constantly scan the attitude indicator and the altimeter, as well as the rest of the six pack. Get in the habit of scanning so that you don't fixate on any single instrument for an extended time.

, If you have a wheel in front of you (the yoke), turn it. If it’s a stick, move it to the left or right to turn. Stay in coordinated flight by using the needle ball (turn coordinator). This gauge depicts a little airplane with a level line and a black ball along it. Keep the black ball in the center by adjusting the rudder so your turns feel smooth (coordinated).A useful learning aid is think step on the ball to know which rudder pedal to step on when co-ordinating a turn.
The ailerons ""control"" the bank angle and work in conjunction with the rudder. When turning, coordinate the rudder and ailerons by keeping the turn and bank instrument ball centered, remembering to keep an eye on your altitude and air speed by scanning the six pack.

Note: When the yoke is turned to the left, the left aileron goes up, and the right goes down; when turning right, the right aileron goes up and the left aileron goes down. Do not worry too much about the mechanics of aerodynamics at this point, just try to become familiar with the basic concepts.



, Every airplane has an engine power setting optimized for the cruise phase of flight. Once you've reached your desired altitude, this power should be set to around 75%. Trim the aircraft for straight and level flight. You will feel the controls become smoother as you trim the plane. You'll also find on some aircraft that this power setting is in the torque free zone, where no rudder input is required to maintain straight line flight.


At maximum power you may find that the nose drifts laterally due to the engine torque and requires an opposite rudder correction. Similarly, you may find that the opposite rudder input is required at flight idle power setting.
To keep the plane steady, it's necessary to maintain sufficient airflow and speed. Flying too slowly or at overly steep angles can cause the plane to lose airflow and stall. This is most dangerous during takeoff and landing, but it's also important to keep the plane at the appropriate speed during flight.
Just as you would wear out your car engine if you drove with your foot planted to the floor, you'll do the same to the plane's engine. Only increase power to maintain airspeed in a climb and reduce power to descend without accelerating.

, If (and when) you experience extreme turbulence, it is critical not to over-correct. Sudden, large changes in the control surface orientations can push the aircraft past its structural limits, causing damage to the plane and, potentially, compromising its ability to continue flying.


Another issue is carburetor icing. There is a small knob labelled ""carb heat"". Apply carb heat for short periods of time, about every ten minutes or so, especially at the high relative humidity levels that encourage icing. Note: This only applies for planes with a carburetor.
Don't zone out. – You still need to be scanning for other aircraft and keeping an eye on the six pack.

, Once you get a constant cruising speed, you can set the controls and lock them, so the plane will remain at a constant power and you can focus on keeping it level. At this stage, reduce the power on the throttle to about 75% of where it was set. For a single engine Cessna, this should be somewhere around 2400 RPM.


Next set the trim. The trim is a small surface on the edge of the elevator. It can be moved from within the cockpit. Setting it correctly will prevent the plane from climbing or descending while in cruise flight.
There are different kinds of trim systems. Some consist of a wheel, lever, or crank which pulls a cable or rod attached to a trim surface bell-crank. Another is a jackscrew and rod. And yet others are an electrical system (which is the easiest to use). The trim setting on each plane has a corresponding speed that the aircraft will seek and hold. It varies by weight, plane design, center of gravity, and carrying weight (cargo plus passengers).

, An essential part of flight is staying in touch with ATC (Air Traffic Control), Approach Control, or Tower, during approach and landing procedures. You can find the correct frequencies on your sectional chart.


When changing frequencies on the communication radio it is courteous to listen for the better part of a minute to make sure no stations are in the middle of an exchange. Only when you are sure there are no ""conversations"" going on should you make your initial broadcast. This helps to avoid the ""stepped on"" situation which occurs when multiple stations are broadcasting on the same frequency at the same time.

, To do this, reduce power and lower the flaps to the appropriate level. Do not deploy flaps at excessively high speeds (only when airspeed is within the white arch on the airspeed instrument). Stabilize the airspeed and rate of descent by applying back pressure on the control wheel. Knowing if you're right just takes practice.


Pick your aiming point and begin your descent.

, This is controlled by a mixture of throttle and yoke. Once you've found a runway, you need to have the combination exactly right to land. When it comes to flying an airplane, this is the hardest part.


A general rule is that the best approach speed is 1.3 multiplied by the stalling speed of the aircraft.This should be indicated on the ASI. However, always take into account wind speed, too.

, Those are there for a reason: They tell the pilot whether he or she is going to overshoot or land short. Lower the nose, keeping the numbers right on your horizon.


If the numbers start to disappear under the aircraft nose, you are landing long.
If the number distance themselves from the aircraft nose, you are landing short.
As you get closer to the ground, you will experience the ""ground-effect."" This will be explained by your instructor in detail, but basically the ground effect causes the plane to float a bit because of reduced drag near the ground.

, Raise the nose slowly by pulling back on the yoke, until the two main wheels touch down. Continue holding the nose wheel off the ground; it will settle to the ground by itself.

, Once the nose wheel has touched down, you can apply brakes to slow for exiting the runway. Exit as soon as possible on the off ramp specified by the tower. Never stop on a runway.

Flight simulators will help you learn about the instruments and systems found in a typical trainer aircraft as well as make you familiar with maneuvers and procedures you will need to master for your private pilot exam. Thus you will need to spend less time and money on actual flight lessons, which are quite expensive. X-Plane's website truthfully says that if a flight simulator can save you an hour with a controller, it will have effectively paid for itself. Remember that while flight simulators are good for procedures training, they won't give you all of the stick-and-rudder skills to fly a real airplane.;

Your instructor, Certified Flight Instructor (CFI), will probably charge for time on the ground as well as in the air.,
Get your Class III Medical.",How to Become Qualified to Fly a Plane2," This is not just a way for the CFI to generate more income. If used wisely, you will become proficient more quickly than by just flying. For example, if you study your intended flight prior to the flight lesson, you will optimize the time you spend with your CFI by having smarter questions and clearly understanding what you are going to do. Additionally, you should receive a thorough post-flight debrief - even if everything went picture perfect. As you progress in your training these pre and post flight debriefs should get shorter.

, It's relatively simple to pass if you're in good health. No use starting sometime if you have a health condition that will preclude you from flying. www.faa.gov has the info to help you determine if you have any health exclusions.

Decide what you're going to chair-fly.,
Pick a place to chair-fly.,
Clear your mind and begin.,
Finish well.,
Repeat.",How to Chair Fly,"

Is it a ground reference maneuver? A flow checklist? An instrument approach? A stage check? A checkride? Know what you're going to practice before you sit down and start. Have a goal for the practice session such as memorizing a flow check, knowing how you'll respond to an examiner, being familiar with the physical process for turns around a point, or knowing exactly when you'll lower the gear after a procedure turn. Picking a goal gives focus to a chair-flying session and helps you decide how long you need to practice.
Chair-flying doesn't have to be a formal. It may simply be a mental outline of a flight to come rehearsed in your head until you are comfortable with the procedures you're going to perform and in what sequence they will be preformed in. In this case, know what level of mental preparedness you're trying to achieve.;
,

A quiet place with somewhere to sit is usually best and allows you to maintain focus while chair-flying. Be sure it is free of distractions. Grab any checklists, flow sheets, or instrument procedures you need for the rehearsal.
If you have access to it, an aircraft flight deck is a wonderful place to chair-fly. Having the cockpit right in front of you adds a tactile level to manipulating controls, pulling out checklists, and running through procedures - allowing for the more rapid learning of physical tasks.
In bed before sleep is a good place to mental chair-fly. Just before bed you can run through the next day's flight and what you're hoping to accomplish, dismiss any anxiety you might feel, and consider improvements from previous flights to be incorporated. The quiet time in bed may aid in the mental visualization of maneuvers as well.

,

Chair flying works best when you pretend you're actually flying.
Run through the procedures you're practicing exactly as they would occur in an actual flight. Move your hands to manipulate controls, press buttons, dial the GPS, extend the flaps, and any other motion you would actually do in the places that these items are located. It doesn't matter that they're just phantoms, your body will remember the general movements. Omit nothing, and try to incorporate realistic events that may happen on the flight in order to practice your response to them (what you would do if the wind shifted or died down while practicing rectangular patterns, or how you would respond if suddenly given an engine failure on an instrument approach in IMC conditions, e.g.).
When a mistake has been made during a flow or mental procedure stop, go back, and re-do it. The rule of primacy states that a first experience tends to be the strongest. If you continually make a mistake while doing a flow check or procedure practice and don't make a strong correction to it you are more likely to repeat that mistake later when under the stress of a real flight.

, When you feel you have accomplished your goal for the practice session, end it. There's no purpose in rehearsing to the point of total boredom. Frequent, short chair-flying sessions are more effective than long infrequent ones when it comes to cementing procedures., Chair-flying can almost be done anywhere and is a suitable practice technique for use before every flight. It aids in your overall mental and physical preparedness in a variety of scenarios. Something you've rehearsed in your head beforehand is much less likely to catch you off-guard if or when it actually occurs."

Get the attitude down!,
Be aware of your surroundings, and take interest in them.,
Carry interesting things.,
Pick things to do.,
Try not to blink a lot.,
Look straight into their eyes and slow your breathing down; everyone you look at will do the same.,
Stare at someone intently.,
Cover your mouth and nose lightly when at school, work etc., not like you're about to hurl though.,
You also want to eat a really big breakfast so at lunch you do not eat in front of people (or drink) then when you get home you can eat.",How to Pretend to be a Modern Vampire (Male)," Remember that this type of vampire is not the kind that broods in a melodramatic fashion all day. You should be quiet and mysterious, but also relaxed and friendly. Act as normal as possible, in order to deflect awkward questions. Always act intelligent and polite but keep a darkness to yourself.;
, Stop to smell flowers, look at the tops of buildings, touch any stone decorations you like, and look at the sky once in a while. This is not exclusive to vampires-- in fact, it is a great way for anyone to reduce stress and enjoy their surroundings.

, They do not need to be for anything, but they help you play the part by being there. Things like a skeleton key, an interesting charm, a Swiss Army knife, an antique looking sketchbook (they sell nice ones at Barnes&Noble and Borders) and/or book to read. Basically whatever your imagination comes up with will do just fine. But keep it small, since you will probably be carrying it in a small pouch or in your pockets.Do remember a silvery key as a necklace or something. When someone asks what it is, say a family memento, passed down through generations.

, Most towns have something within walking distance that you can go to while ""playing vampire."" Going to a cemetery to relax, read, or write in your sketchbook is always good, but a park will do for this, and if you're good at climbing trees, then read, rest, or write up in the branches. Also, going to the library to read quietly, or going to a local coffee shop to calmly sip a warm drink are great activities. If there are any pretty old churches in your area, hanging around near them would work, too. Again, these activities are not exclusive to vampires, or to people who want to be vampires. They are quite relaxing, and commonly done.

, Try not to blink when someone is looking at you and it will look creepy, as if you had no eyelids.

, If you need to blink, either blink slowly or very quickly.

, From time to time just stare at someone intently, your face should look like the face of a homeless person staring at a sirloin steak.

, Act like a scent is bothering you (their blood). If someone asks you what is wrong, just say ""nothing, I am fine."" Then stutter a little and then leave. You can also tighten your fist.

, If that does not work for you, you can be a food eating vampire, though stay away from junk food and fast food. A home made meal of a simple lettuce/tomato/cheese salad will do. Sit alone and quietly munch away. If you really need to eat when sitting with somebody, take a casual bite from time to time, and look like it is the most terrible thing ever, so they assume you crave blood instead of regular food

Consider your color scheme.,
Get a striped shirt.,
Find striped leggings or tights.,
Use a onesuit.,
Create your own stripes.,
Acquire face makeup.,
Get a tail.,
Use cat ears.",How to Make a Cheshire Cat Costume1," The Cheshire Cat from the 1951 cartoon movie is striped in purple and pink. In a later cinematic version, the cat is striped in teal and purple. Consider what color scheme is most accessible and which you prefer.When choosing a color scheme, attempt to use the most accessible colors available.;
, Search through thrift stores, clothing stores, or online for a stripped shirt of the desired colors. It’s important to keep the color scheme in mind throughout the creation of the Cheshire Cat.


Costume stores will probably have what you are looking for. Costume stores are also good at having multiple items in the same color scheme.

, The goal is to find the exact color of stripes in pant form. This is not always realistic for some people’s funds. If you do go to a costume store, they should offer a selection in matching tops and bottoms. You could also look online for something with similar colors.


If you can’t find anything, you can wear black pants (skinny) or leggings/tights. The bulk of the costume is from the waist up, so you can still have make an effective Cheshire Cat without a matching bottom.

, You can order a custom onesuit from certain online stores and retailers. There are also onesuit options available that are marketed as a Cheshire Cat costume. Do a quick google search if you were unable to find a matching top and pants., If you're having a hard time finding the right striped colors, you can make your own. You will need a shirt or pair of tights/leggings that is plain and one of your colors. You'll also need tape and fabric paint. Create stripes out of the tape. Once you have the tape setup the way you want it, you can paint onto the shirt.Follow the directions of the fabric paint for mixing with water or any other liquid. Use a brush to paint stripes between the taped stripes.
Let the paint dry for about an hour before removing the tape.

, There are several options you can take with face makeup. You can go for a simple design that can be effective if done right, or do a full paint job with multiple layers. Depending on what style you want to take, you can either go to a costume store for a multiple color face paint set, or find something similar in a general store.


Consider the quality of the face makeup and strive for higher quality paint. It will look better and it will be better for your skin.

, There are several options for a cat tail. Any costume shop will have these pre-made and offer them at a reasonable price. You can alternatively gather the following supplies and create a tail on your own:


A pair of old black tights or fluffy fabric
Needle and thread
Wire and wire cutters (coat hanger will work)
Strip of fabric (to use as the belt), Cat ears are very common to buy premade. A simple black cat is a very popular (last minute) costume. For this reason, you can get a cat ear headband for a decent price. If you’d rather do it yourself, you’ll need the following supplies:


2 colors of fabric
Fabric wire
Pliers
Scissors
Headband

Once you've found several, make a small bed in each room if there isn't already one, using pillows and/or sleeping bags. Also, provide blankets, towels, treats, and goodies.;
, Create numbers on each key, and hang them on the door. Construct a front desk, and make do not disturb signs

, You could also include your family members, as well as siblings. If you have a pet, use him/her as a door animal.

, Use other rooms, and have room service to have some fun in life. Take turns when it comes to managing the hotel, and avoid creating any messes.

, You can do this by using a piece of paper or a notebook.

, You could also have one of your friends pretend to be the maid, but make sure you don't boss everyone around.

Move slowly and laconically.,
Talk in a low, gravely voice.,
Keep munching on small snacks.",How to Look Like You Are on Drugs1," This is the classic ""stoner"" gaze. Smoking causes the veins in your eyes to expand, which makes them much more visible. This causes the well-known red eye in stoners.


You can also rub some freshly cut onion or peppermint extract under your eyes to get the tears flowing, which causes red eye.
Try not to blink. It isn't fun, but it will create red eye.;
, Your eyelids and lips will fall lightly to the floor, as if half asleep. Let yourself sink into the chair, or slump slightly whenever you're standing. You want to be totally relaxed.


If you find yourself staring for a long time into nothing, body barely moving, then you're crushing it.

, You're not in a hurry, man. Keep the hustle to a minimum, really only moving when it is most necessary. High-guys & gals rarely feel compelled to do things that aren't strictly necessary, and neither should you. When you do move, take your time.


Try to flow through your movements, like the pictures of grooving hippies used in cartoons and old videos., Imagine that your throat and mouth are bone dry, as many people who smoke regularly can attest. Drop your voice into a low, bass-y register and scratch out the words a bit.

, A bag of chips or a box of Oreos is the perfect prop for the high-guy. Aim for regular, unceasing eating, which is why bagged chips and pretzels are often your best bet. The ""munchies"" generally aim for salty or sweet foods, and some stoners find them uncontrollable. Well-placed, constant eating will help sell the part well."

Apply the base layer.,
Apply a layer of purple.,
Lighten your cheeks.,
Add additional details.,
Create the Cheshire’s smile.",How to Make a Cheshire Cat Costume2," You can either use face paint or makeup. Put a base paint of yellow all over your face. This is the iconic foundation for the Cheshire Cat from the 1951 cartoon.

, Sponge purple around the outside of your face so that the the yellow fades in. You can use a house sponge if you do not own any makeup accessories. Be sure to cover all the areas that are on the outside of your face like: the top of your forehead, neck, ears, etc., Dab your cheeks with white to lighten your cheeks. It might help you to look at a picture of the Cheshire Cat and apply the paint in relation to the image.

, Use yellow or white eyeliner along your waterline. Draw whiskers in black around your nose. Color in your nose with black face paint. You can use black eyeliner for the whiskers., You don’t have to create a mouth out of make up over your mouth, but instead could wear purple lipstick. There are a few ways you can create the smiling mouth out of makeup. Depending on your makeup skills, you can make the classic smiling face, or create a scarier face with sharper teeth.For the classic smile: use white makeup to create a wide smiling face around your mouth. Imagine a crescent moon when designing the smile. Once the white has dried, use a fine tipped brush or eyeliner to create teeth. The classic smile, from the cartoon, only has one row of teeth.
The Tim Burton smile is much creepier because the teeth are rigged and fang like. To create this look, you’ll need to create a crescent smile using black paint. Once the black has dried, create small teeth in the shape of triangles, or in the shape of shark’s teeth. Create two rows of teeth: one row going down from the top and the other going up from the bottom of the mouth.

Buy a headband.,
Create the ears out of fabric.,
Reinforce the ears with wire.,
Attach the ears to the headband.,
Create the tail.,
Attach the tail the body.",How to Make a Cheshire Cat Costume3," You can get these fairly cheap from a clothing outlet. Sort through their selection and try to find a black headband or a color from your color scheme. Use a cheaper headband because you’ll be gluing or sewing onto the headband., Select two types of fabric, the inside and outside of the ears. The inside fabric should be lighter than the outside fabric. Cut four bigger triangles from the darker fabric and two from the lighter one.You can either glue or sew the triangle together.


Attach one inner triangle to one of the bigger triangles, and repeat for the other ear.
Attach your spare triangles to the backside of each ear. Leave a small opening on the bottom to insert a wire frame into the ear.

, You can use an old coat hanger to create smaller wire frames to be used in the ears. Use pliers to cut two strips off a coat hanger. Fold the wire in the shape of an acute angle. Thread your wires into the ears.


If the wire is too long, make adjustments.
You can also purchase craft wire from a hobbyist store.
Use glue to secure the wires to the ears.

, Sew or glue the ears together and then onto the headband. Use a mirror to determine the best location for the ears. A hot glue gun will hold the ears to the headband the best., Use a coat hanger as the frame for the cat tail. Cut off a side of the coat hanger using wire cutters or pliers. Keep the hanger portion to use as the curly tip of the tail. Wrap the hanger in a fluffy fabric or old tights. To secure the fabric, use a hot glue gun while wrapping the tail.You can find furry fabric at craft and costume stores. Some fabrics are sold to be used for tails and are already the proper size.
Cut off any excess fabric from the hanger.

, Attaching the tail is one of the simpler steps to the costume. All you need is black string. First, wrap the string around your waist to figure out what length to use. Cut out the desired length of string. Use a hot glue gun, stapler, or tape to attach the tail to the middle point of the string.


It’s better to cut out a longer piece of string opposed to a shorter one.
You can alternatively attach the tail to a belt using tape.

Spend a long, long time looking at things with a sense of wonder.,
Giggle often, but keep it to yourself.,
Touch a lot of things, rubbing them to enjoy the variety of textures.,
Get deep and philosophical about our shared experience and place in the universe.,
Consider throwing a fake ""bad trip,"" complete with a mental breakdown, if you're a true actor.",How to Look Like You Are on Drugs2," Tripping causes many users to see patterns, new colors, and even objects and people appear out of everyday life, making the entire world a fascinating playground. The idea of seeing the world as if for the first time, astonished by the shifting things around you, is key to playing the psychedelic user.


Keep your eyes wide open, taking in as many sights as possible.
Curiosity is your guiding principle.

, There is rarely something funny happening, but a tripper will find the the humor. Usually, this sort of laughter just kind of bubbles up in trippers as the result of a cool sight, strange new texture, or completely random, untraceable thought.

, Psychedelics tend to be sensory overload, and touch is one of the most commonly enjoyed. Note, however, that trippers are rarely zoned into one sense at once. The thing you're stroking is likely changing color or visualizes as well, molding under your hand.


Again, the sense of wonder is key to selling the performance. You don't have to explain what you see -- just be entranced by it., People who trip are rarely selfish -- they're too out-there to be self-absorbed. Instead, they often ""see"" connections between everyone, and every living thing, that sober people don't. When they talk, trippers are often speaking on a ""higher plane"" that doesn't usually make sense for the people who aren't on the same ride:


A long rant about the beauty and connection between you and the earth would not be out of place.
Stopping halfway trough a thought, as if taken by an incredible and inexplicable new truth, can help if you're running out of philosophical thoughts to improvise.

, Want to really go for broke on your fake trip? Make it a bad one! You'll need to be convincingly freaked out, and you'll need a point of fixation -- either an object that has ""transformed"" into a demon or an imaginary space that you claim is ""filled with horrible energy."" Bad trips are characterized by:


Wide-eyed fear
Fixation on a real or imagined worry, stress, or terror
Sweating, nervously moving.
Nausea
Desire to be anywhere but here
Inability to move (paralyzed by fear)"

Talk as much as you possibly can.,
Resist the urge to stand still.,
Wipe your nose frequently.,
Move into irritability as the night moves on.,
""Crash"" into a low-energy mess if you don't ""re-up"" during the acting job.",How to Look Like You Are on Drugs3," People might not really enjoy your company, but such is the burden of acting. Motor-mouth syndrome commonly besets those using high-energy drugs like cocaine, as the thoughts spill out so fast the user can't get them up fast enough. It doesn't matter what you're saying, just keep talking.

, Tap your fingers and feet. Get up and move around every few minutes. Let your eyes dart back and forth across the room uncontrollably. You want to feel like there is an enormous reserve of energy inside of you that is bursting at the seams, powering you like the energizer bunny.


Many cocaine users even report that they breath faster than normal.

, If you're faking drug inhalation, then you'll be scratching at your nose and wiping away excess snot for the majority of the night.

, When all of your energy comes from drugs, you can quickly go from restless to agitated. You might snap easily, be prone to anger, or just start acting uncomfortable and squirmy. This is often showcased by extreme mood swings, which become more noticeable with higher doses and longer highs., Uppers don't tend to last long, instead sapping the user of all their energy and leaving them far, far more depressed than when they began. Cocaine, for reference, usually only lasts about 20 minutes.Sleepiness, irritability, and lethargy are common in the crashing phase.

Act like a sleepy, happy baby, talking little and smiling sleepily.,
Lurch into wide-eyed happiness right after ""taking"" the drug, then fade into sleepiness.,
Let your words and actions drift off into nothing.,
Drift off regularly, either by falling asleep or simply zoning out into oblivion.,
Scratch at yourself regularly, as itchiness is often a side-effect of opiates.",How to Look Like You Are on Drugs4," This is most common dangerous and powerful drugs like heroin. Downers, like opiates, usually leave people in a happy stupor, unable and unwilling to move off the couch they're on. They often squirm around sensually like a baby in blankets, getting comfortable and enjoying every single second of it.

, Watch Ewan McGregor's masterful performance as a heroin addict in Trainspotting to see how quick this shift can be. Opiates often hit hard, bringing a wave of euphoria, before putting the user into a mellow, sleepy, and often useless state., Most opiate users have their heads blissfully in the clouds. They may start a thought, but finishing it isn't really important. Ask someone's attention, but don't have anything to say when they turn to you. Keep your voice low and quiet.

, The overall idea is to remain stuck in the clouds, unable to pin down your thoughts. More often than not, this leads to literally falling asleep, your head lolling up in surprise slightly every so often, as if just waking up., Again, this is particularly true of heroin, but drugs like Oxycontin are actually the same compound, just slightly weaker. Scratch on your forearms, but don't make a big deal of it. This is just another uncontrollable tic, not some dedicated urge."

Use folding chairs, if you have them, and set them up in rows. For desks, you can use little stools. You can also just use chairs.
Pick the front of the classroom and put a big piece of paper on the wall, like the a chalk board. Use markers to write on the paper instead of chalk.;

Blair usually rolls up the sleeves on her blouse, so get a shirt with longer sleeves that can be cuffed.;
, Blair always tucks her button-downs into a navy A-line skirt when she's at school. Invest in a similar skirt and tuck your shirt in accordingly. This will give off a prep school vibe reminiscent of the Gossip Girl franchise.If you really dislike navy, shake up Blair's look just a little. A dark brown or black skirt should still give off the basic vibe.

, Blair is not always at school. When she's out on the town, she's a fan of long, lacy dresses. Blair's dresses are usually quite feminine and come in bright colors, floral patterns, and have embellishments like bows, sequins, and ruffles.For example, opt for a floral sundress or a gown with lacy embellishments.

, If you want to rock the Blair Waldorf look for a fancy event like prom, a red gown is your best option. One of the most iconic moments in Gossip Girl was Blair meeting Chuck in Paris in an elegant red dress.Go for a dress with a ballroom feel and feathery embellishments on the skirt.
The dress was strapless in the TV show, so see if you can find a strapless dress.

, Blair is known for a more natural makeup look, so there's no need to cake on a lot of makeup. Stick to the basics. Cover imperfections, like acne and discoloration, with a light layer of concealer and foundation. Then, use a brush to blend the makeup into your natural skin tone., Blair's eyebrows were always strongly defined, so make sure yours match. Use a brow brush to fill in any obvious gaps in your brows. As you're only slightly filling in your brows, use a shade slightly lighter than their natural color., Blair was known for her lighter eye makeup, so opt for white eyeliner and eyeshadow. Apply pale eyeshadow just below your upper brow and in the inner corner of your eye. Smudge white eyeliner along your upper lash line. Use your fingers to smooth the eyeliner on your lid upward so it blends out into your eyelid., Blair's eye makeup was always light and feminine, so a touch of pink and brown is all you need for your eyeshadow. Start by using an eyeshadow brush to add a light dusting of a pale pink shade across your lids. Then, apply a soft brown to your crease.When you're done, make sure to blend out the eyeshadow using a larger eyeshadow brush.

, Blair did not wear a lot of eye makeup. Stick to one coat of mascara on each eye. This should slightly bring out your lashes without creating an overwhelming look.You can use either brown or black mascara and, if you want, apply it to both top and bottom lashes.

, Gently dab on a light shade of a pinkish lipstick. You do not need to apply a lot of lipstick. The color should mostly cover imperfections on your lip and add a light amount of color., Blair rarely wore her hair up. Let your hair hang down if you want to give off a Blair Waldorf vibe. Simply brush out your hair in the morning and let it fall down naturally.As Blair had wavy hair, consider using a curling iron or wand to create light waves in your own hair.

, Blair was famous for her series of feminine headbands. Place the headband about an inch away from your hairline. If you have bangs, keep them in front of the headband and swept slightly to one side.Pick feminine headbands with patterns like polkadot and embellishments like bows.

, If you're doing the school girl look, add a small bow tie to your white button-down. This was part of the uniforms worn on Gossip Girl and will really emphasize the Blair Waldorf look. This can be particularly great if you're going as Blair Waldorf to a costume party., Knee-high socks were also part of the Blair Waldorf look. Pick a pair of knee-high socks to match your skirt to emphasize the school girl look., If you're going schoolgirl, white loafers are key. These were typically worn during school for Blair Waldorf. Slip on a pair of white loafers if you're wearing a white button-down and skirt., Blair was known for stylish hats. If you're going out in a dress looking like Blair, add a colorful, patterned hat to your outfit. This will add a little extra to your look and really exemplify Blair's style.Blair was a big fan of patterned hats, so see if you can find hats with patterns like polkadots.

, When going out on the town, Blair always wore pumps. Therefore, if you're going as Blair for a formal event, slip on a pair of pumps with your dress.Blair wore a variety of hats, but she mostly favored knit hats and berets throughout the series.
In addition to hats, Blair sometimes wore floral or decorative hairpieces.

, Her hair is short and curly. You don't have to cut your hair, it's not necessary unless you want to, that's cool too I guess. Anyway. It's shorter, and curly, and a dark brown. I would suggest using some of your grandmas rollers from the basement, get the classic experience. If you have a totally different hairstyle going on right now, no biggie, just look up pin up girl hairstyles and get some inspiration from that.

Bring in the students.,
Teach a short lesson.,
Have the students take notes.,
Ask the students questions.,
Have students come to the board.,
Go to lunch.,
Go to recess.",How to Play Teacher2," You need to have some people to teach! Invite some friends over, or ask your siblings or other family members if they'd like to play with you. Can't find anyone to play? Line up stuffed animals or other toys, so you'll have a classroom ready to go.


Put each student in a separate chair in the classroom. You can assign seats, or let students choose their own. You could even put name tags on each desk, or have the students make them.
Take your place at the front of the classroom and tell everyone to quiet down, because school is about to start.

, Now that you've got your group of students gathered, start teaching! Write things on the paper that you've got on the wall to help you show the students what they're supposed to learn.


You could even do a fun activity, like having the students ""dissect"" different stuffed animals and talk about what they find, if you want to have a science class. This could be a fun way to spend school time.

, Give each one of your students pieces of paper, or notebooks, so they can write things down and do little assignments, or take notes. Tell them specifically what they should do. You could also have them read out what they've written.


If you're teaching English class, you could say, ""Write about what you did this weekend in a timed writing!"" and then have everyone read it out.

, When you're the teacher, you've got a good chance to put everyone else on the spot. Throw out math questions and call on people randomly, or call on people with really silly or difficult questions. ""Mr. Anderson, please come to the front of the class and explain how dinosaurs kiss to us. We're waiting!""


Turn the questions into a game. Ask all your students, ""What's 132 minus 17?"" and let them figure it out fast. Whoever gets the answer right quickest gets a candy.
Some teachers like to play bingo to get students involved. That could be a good way to play, as well.

, It's scary in real school, but at your pretend school it can be a lot of fun. Have each student come up to the board to answer a question, or to write in their answer to a question that you've asked.


Ask a math problem, or give them a silly prompt to draw something. Tell all the students that whoever can draw the best brontosaurus gets a gummy worm.

, After a little school, have all your students line up and walk to the ""lunch room."" If you can get your parents to be in charge of the cafeteria, that would be perfect. Have sandwiches and milk, or whatever you normally eat at lunch, ready to eat like you do at school. Then sit all together and have your lunch like normal.

, After lunch, have everyone go outside and play recess like you do at school, or see if your parents will take you to a park, to play on the playground stuff there.

"
"
Take turns.,
Make up a new name for yourself as ""the teachers name."",
Dress like a teacher.,
Talk like a teacher.,
Be organized.,
Don't be too strict.",How to Play Teacher3," It's fun being in charge, but you shouldn't get to be in charge all the time. Make sure that each time you play you take plenty of different turns, switching back and forth between being teacher and student. Even if you're really good at it.


Have lots of different roles at your school that you can switch between. Have one person be a student, one person be a teacher, and one person be a principal, or detention person. Take turns between all of them.

, Pick a regular type of name, like Mr. Smithson or Mrs. Black, or pick a totally silly teacher name like Miss Serious or Mr. Stinkypits. Pick whatever name you like, or make one up on your own. Insist that all the students call you by the right name.

, Teachers definitely have a style. Dress up in some of your nicer clothes, and wear glasses if you can to pretend to be the teacher. Pull up your pants too high and comb your hair really well. Walk like an old person.


If your mom has a funny old dress that she wouldn't mind you playing with, that could be perfect for a teacher costume. Ask if you can get one at a second-hand store, if you don't have one, for a costume.
Male teachers should wear ties and glasses. Suspenders if possible.

, Lower your voice and talk very seriously when you're pretending to be the teacher. Don't laugh at anything and call everyone ""Mr. Josh"" or ""Miss Angela."" Be very stern, like a teacher would be.


If you all have the same teacher, you could always just do an impression of the things that your teacher says.
try to learn some big words to use when you're playing teacher, since teachers are always trying to teach. ""Well isn't that odiferous?"" you could say, when something stinks.

, Keep a bunch of ""school stuff"" really organized on a desk at the front of your classroom, with everything labeled with post-it notes, if you have them. Write up a little name tag for yourself, or have little baskets to put all your school supplies in.


Or, you could always have your desk really messy, if your teacher has a really messy one. That could be a funny way to make school fun.

, It's supposed to be fun! try to keep your students quiet and settled, but they'll probably mostly want to mess you up and say silly things, since this isn't real school. That's ok. Make a fun game out of sending students to detention or giving them silly punishments, but don't take it too seriously.


Most of your friends will probably want to goof off in your classroom. That's fine. It's all in good fun. Assign one person to be the detention monitor, and have fun!

Write an essay about your character.,
Read the whole play.,
Read essays about the character, especially if it is a character from a play.,
Watch other interpretations of the character with care.,
Read the book, if the play is based off of one.,
Read about the character's world.",How to Get Into Character1," Ask yourself some questions about your character, and try to answer them. It may help you understand your character better. This is a good idea not only for characters in a play, but also for cosplays, Renaissance Faire (and other re-enactment) characters, and original larp characters. Here are some questions you should ask yourself:What does your character look like? Are there any unique features, such as a limp or hump?
How does your character speak? Does he/she have a lisp or an accent?
What is your character's station in life? Are they part of the upper class, such as a king? Or are they from the lower class, such as a town drunk?
What does your character want? Does he/she get that?
How does your character resolve problems? Do they get frustrated? Do they expect others to solve it for them?
What do others expect from your character? How does your character feel about those expectations? Do they meet them, surpass them, or fail them?
How do other characters feel about your character? Is your character well liked, or disliked?;
, This includes the parts that your character doesn't appear in. If you only read the parts with your character, you might miss important events that he/she might be aware of. These events might affect how he/she behaves.

, Don't just go for any essays, however. Go for scholarly and peer-reviewed essays. Many of these essays will go in depth on the character, and analyze his/her thoughts, behavior, and role in the play. For example, Shylock from The Merchant of Venice can be a villain or a victim. The essays you read might help you decide how to depict him: villain or victim.


This also applies to historical roles for Renaissance Fairs and other historical reenactments.

, Your director may want you to interpret your character differently from how he/she is depicted in other versions of the play (especially filmed versions).

, Some plays are based off of books, but they don't always tell you everything about a certain character. The book, however, might give you that information. It might show you how the character behaves ""off-stage."" You can use this information when acting as your character. Examples of plays (and musicals) based off of books include:


Dracula
The Phantom of the Opera

Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King are not based off of books, but movies. In this case, you might want to watch the movie.

, Most plays will take place in a past time period. You can make your character more believable by learning about that time period. The one exception to this, of course, is if the director wants to do a modern interpretation of a play. An example would be setting Romeo and Juliette during the 1940s, with one family being Jewish and the other being German, instead of during the Renaissance.

"
"
Watch their episodes, if possible.,
Read the books/manga/comics.,
Play the games, if possible.,
Study the character and learn the character's backstory.,
Take note of how the character talks.,
Take note of the character's manners and actions.,
Don't be afraid to interact with other cosplayers.",How to Get Into Character2," Study how the character talks, acts, and moves. Note how he/she behaves towards other characters. Some people act differently towards different people.

, Keep in mind that the print version of the character can be different from the film version. This may include how the character looks and acts. The character's backstory may also change.


Some people find it easier to remember a character's quotes if they are written, rather than spoken.

, Some characters also appear in video games. These games can tell you more about the character. Some games even expand the character's backstory. Keep in mind, that not every character will appear in a video game—and if they do, it may not always be a large part.


Make sure that you play licensed gamed and not fan-created games. Fan-created games do not always portray the characters accurately. Instead, they often cater towards certain parts of the fandom.

, The backstory can explain why a character acts the way he/she does. For example, Severus Snape from Harry Potter, is often mean, especially to Harry Potter. His backstory, however, reveals that he was bullied by Harry's father.


The backstory can also give you ideas for interacting with other cosplayers.

, You will also want to note his/her facial expressions. These tiny details can help bring your cosplay to life and make it more believable.


Note speech patterns. Does the character have a casual way or talking, or a more old-fashioned, archaic way? For example, Thor from the ""Avengers"" often uses old, archaic terms such as ""thou.""
Note repeated words or phrases. For example, Reno from ""Final Fantasy VII"" often ends his sentences with ""yo.""
Note the way a character talks. Does your character talk fast in a pitchy voice? Or does he have a slower, halting way of talking? Severus Snape is known for having very long... pauses... when he speaks.

, Study the way the character walks and stands. This can help make your cosplay more believable. After all, a Gaston (from ""Beauty and the Beast"") who slouches all the time will not be very convincing. Gaston would stand tall and proud!


Is the character known for reacting a specific way to certain words and phrases? For example, Edward Elric from ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" gets very, very upset whenever someone implies that he is short.
Does the character have a specific walk? Captain Jack Sparrow from ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" has a very distinctive, swaying walk, often accompanied by a confused look and expressive hand gestures.

, Sometimes, it is easier to get into character when you have a friend (or another friendly cosplayer) to play along with you. Keep in mind, however, that not every cosplayer will want to play along. If they don't react to you, move on. Do not force them to play along with you, or they may report you to con-ops for harassment.


Envy from ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" would never skip a chance to call Edward Elric ""short."" If you are cosplaying Envy and you spot and Edward, try yelling out: ""Hey, Fullmetal Shrimp!"" and watch the hilarity ensue.
The Marauders from Harry Potter were known for tormenting Severus Snape. If you are cosplaying a young James or Sirius, and you come across a young Severus Snape, try calling him Snivellous—but don't be alarmed if he responds with a hex!
Kagome from ""Inuyasha"" disciplines the dog demon by yelling ""SIT,"" which forces him to sit down. If you see an Inuyasha misbehaving or being rude, be sure to discipline him by saying: ""Inyuasha! Sit!""

Get the garments.,
Style your hair.,
Apply your makeup.,
Adopt her personality traits.",How to Look Like Snow White1," For a the classic Disney look, you'll need to buy or make an outfit that looks like the one Snow White wears in the cartoon. This will, at minimum, include:


A dress with a cream or yellow ankle-length skirt.
A blue bodice with a scoop neck and thin, vertical gold braid down the center.
Blue and red slashed sleeves or blue sleeves embellished with red laces tied in bows.
A high, stiff white collar.
A white petticoat with a lacy or ruffled edge.
Tan (or neutral) low-heeled pumps with matching bow clips.
A blue cape lined with red (optional).;
, Snow White's hair is described as ""black as ebony.""It is styled in a chin-length bob with soft waves, parted in the center. She wears a red ribbon tied in a bow at the top of her head.


If you're already a brunette with chin-length hair, add curl to your hair. Gently comb it out to create soft waves, part it in the center and add the ribbon.
If not, cut, dye, and style your hair to match Snow White's, or buy a wig that imitates her style.
Some modern depictions of Snow White show her with a tiara instead of a hair bow. Either one will work, though a bow might be truer to people's image of this character.

, Snow White's complexion is ""white as snow"" and her lips are ""red as the rose.""She has dark eyebrows, long, dark eyelashes and rosy cheeks. If you do not have these features, you can use makeup to achieve the look by:


Applying a pale foundation and a layer of matching powder for a porcelain skin look.
Dusting a little pink blush on your cheekbones.

Darkening your eyebrows with a pencil, if necessary.

Applying a neutral colored eyeshadow to your eyelids. Line your upper and lower lids with black eyeliner.
Use mascara to lengthen and darken your eyelashes.
Outline your lips with red or neutral lip liner, and fill in with a matte lipstick in a deep red.

, Snow White is described as gentle, cheerful, helpful and kind.She is also very feminine and proper. If you want to take your costume beyond just looks, here's how:


Snow White always has a cheerful outlook no matter what.She's able to dream of meeting a prince even when serving as a lowly kitchen maid. To achieve this yourself, look on the bright side as often as you can. Like Snow White, sing or hum while you work. Don't forget to smile!
Be helpful to others whenever you can.Hold a door open, pick up something that someone dropped, stay to help clean up after a meal or party. Ask your friends and family, ""What can I do to help?""
Show kindness to others.Be encouraging. Listen with empathy. If you know someone is going through a hard time, send them a card or tell them you are thinking of them. And you should always refrain from gossiping.
Be as feminine as you can. Speak in a high, sweet voice. Learn to move gracefully by taking small, measured steps. Let men take care of things like pulling out chairs, or putting on your coat. Use proper manners and etiquette."
"
Get the look.,
Wear minimal amounts of makeup in natural tones.,
Acquire her fashion.,
Get along well with your family.,
Mabel and her twin brother are practically best friends, so treat your siblings nicely and do things with them.,
Be kind to everyone, even if they are cruel to you.,
Always be cheerful, happy, and optimistic.,
Although you want to be more of a girly-girl, don't be afraid to get a little dirty.,
Love the boys.,
Have a sense of adventure, and be curious.,
Throw lots of slumber parties.",How to Emulate Mabel Pines," Consider growing your hair out very long, and make sure it's thick. Don't worry about styling it much, but if you want to you can consider straightening it or waving it. For the face, keep it clean, healthy, soft, and smooth, with zero acne. Always wash your face with a mild facial cleanser every morning and also at night to make sure no pimples or blackheads pop up. And don't worry about tanning. Mabel spends her summer in the woods in Oregon. She has completely nice skin- there isn't much sunshine over there!;
, Since Mabel has flawless skin, wear foundation, concealer, and face powder to cover trouble spots for the time being and even out your skin tone using clean makeup tools. Also, curl your eyelashes and wear dark brown/black mascara, orange/grey/pink eyeshadow, soft-colored lip gloss, lip liner, and blush to get Mabel's pink rosy blush cheeks, but don't cake on anything. The goal is to look as if you're not wearing anything. Mabel is only twelve years old, so no bronzer yet, please!

, If you live up north where it's always a bit chilly, then try to wear fun, girly, colorful sweaters, good-fitting skirts, white socks, and sensible black flats like she does. However, if you're down south where it's always hot, then wear skirts with colorful tank tops and flats. Don't burn yourself to death trying to get the Mabel look.

, Don't be embarrassed by them when you go out somewhere. After all, they are your dear family and they did so much for you, as they care deeply about you. So cherish them while you can!

, Watch their backs and always be there for them.

, Mabel never wants to hurt anyone's feelings, or abuse people, or be mean and selfish. So follow the Golden Rule, and be nice!

, You will never hear Mabel complain about anything, as she is rarely seen to get angry or upset. Find joy in the little things in life, such as a pretty flower or a baby animal. There will always be something to smile about, so go on and find it. In fact, Mabel wasn't even upset about going to Gravity Falls, Oregon for the summer. Instead, she looked at the bright side of things. She enjoyed herself in Gravity Falls by happily rolling on hills of grass, let a goat chew on her sweater and tried to flirt with boys.

, Don't turn down an opportunity to go into the woods just because it'll mess up your clothes. That's what the washing machine and laundry detergent is for. Be down to earth, but at the same time feel encouraged to love shopping, stylizing your friends' hair, painting your nails, putting on make-up, etc.!

, Mabel's main goal is to have an ""epic summer romance"" while she's away from home, and she willingly grabs any opportunity she can to flirt with boys, even though she may not be the best at it. Don't be afraid to talk to boys, even if they're older or younger than you. Make sure you don't judge people based off looks, too. It's often the personality that counts on the inside.

, Mabel is always wanting to know what is going on. She is extremely curious, even though her curiosity gets the better of her a lot, and it sometimes leads her to trouble and often lands herself in precarious situations. Always be willing to go investigate into something, as curiosity can help you acquire knowledge. However, use your common sense and logic and get out if something proves to be dangerous or threatening, for it can be risky to be too curious.

, There's nothing that Mabel loves more than a crazy sleepover with her friends, Candy & Grenda. Invite your best friends over to paint nails, do each others' hair (try a braid train), and play the board game ""Dream Boy.""


Remember to end the night with someone taped to the wall, someone kissing some random mysterious object in the closet, and someone with ""Party Girl"" written on their forehead. Also make glittery pizza with a smiley face on it!

Take it from virgin to va-voom.,
Discard the prim and proper princess persona.,
Let loose your hair.,
Make your makeup edgy and voluptuous.,
Make your personality mischievous.",How to Look Like Snow White2," Disney depicted its first princess as a 14 year old maiden, but no one says you have to follow suit.If modesty isn't your style, a sexier Snow White-look is well within your grasp.


To be a sexy Snow White, start with the traditional concept and make it shorter, tighter, more revealing, and more dramatic.

, For a sexy look, your clothing and accessories should be skimpy, suggestive, naughty, and more than a little improper.


Wear a much shorter dress (knee-length or higher)with a lower neckline and corset-style bodice.
Add a crinoline petticoat in a contrasting color
Complete your outfit with thigh high stockings and high-heeled Mary Janes in red or black

, Take out the safety pins and shake out your hair. The tousled look will give you a more tempting appearance. Whether your hair is long or short, the goal is to get more relaxed and sensuous.


Style your hair in long, tangled curls or waves.
If you have short hair, use styling product to create a tousled or spiky look.
Add a sparkly red bow clip on one side.
Instead of a hair accessory, consider putting a single streak of red in your hair with spray-in hair color.

, This is not the time to be shy! Use a heavier hand and more dramatic colors with your makeup. Be bold with all your choices, including everything from eyeliner to lipstick.


Apply more blush and eyeliner. This is a great time to try a smoky eye or a cat eye look.
Choose a bright, glittery eyeshadow instead of a neutral
Use long, false eyelashes or lots of layers of mascara
Use a siren red lipstick.

, A sexy Snow White turns traditional Snow White's personality on its head, making it naughty rather than sweet. Where should would be polite and sensitive, you can be overt and suggestive!


Be seductive and flirty. Look a guy in the eye and then lower your eyelashes, sway your hips as you walk, flip your hair, or even lick your lips slowly.
Offer to refill your guy's drink, but when you do so, make sure you show off your assets.
Speak in a low, sultry tone, or put a little purr in your voice. This huskier tone will put you at the opposite end of the spectrum from Snow White's typical sing-song way of speaking.Rather than hold your her hand out for the prince to kiss, run your hand over his chest and admire his physique.
If you're more sweet than sensual, go that route instead. Take Snow White's high, sweet voice and make it coy (think Betty Boop). Act a little helpless or airheaded. Flutter your eyelashes innocently.

"
"
Round out the cast.,
Create a prop dwarf, or several.,
Remember her animal companions.,
Join with other Disney princesses.,
Include other parts of the story.,
Revisit the story.",How to Look Like Snow White3," The characters in Snow White are iconic in our culture, and these make it easy to include others in a group costume. You might suggest to your friends to join you dressed as:


The huntsman
Prince Charming
One of the seven dwarfs
The Queen or her alter ego, the Crone
The Magic Mirror

, If you don't have any friends that want to join you in your fairy-tale adventures, you can still include your favorite dwarf in your costume. Take an old doll (or buy a new one), make a costume out of felt or cloth in the fashion of your chosen dwarf, dress it up and take it along with you wherever you go.


For example, if you wanted Dopey to be your companion while dressed as Snow White, you might make an overly large, robe-shaped outfit for your doll. Add a purple stocking cap to complete this simple costume.

, Snow White is depicted as so gentle and kind that when she reaches a cottage in the forest, she has already won over the forest creatures.You might want to use a hair clip to attach a fake bird to your shoulder to give this effect.

, Many of the princesses of the Disney universe are beloved characters, well known in pop-culture. You might consider doing a Disney princesses themed group costume with your friends! Some princesses to consider:


Alice (Alice in Wonderland)
Belle (Beauty and the Beast)
Cinderella (Cinderella)
Jasmine (Aladdin), You can create conversation pieces and further get into character by adding other elements of the story to your costume. You could take a hand mirror and draw a crack on it with an erasable marker and bring this with you wherever you go. When people ask you about it, you could say:


""This is the magic mirror that the wicked Queen used, but it broke when she died.""

, Though you may remember most of the story from seeing the movie Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs as a child. But if you haven't seen it in a while, you may want to make sure you remember everything correctly. Attention to detail will give more depth to your costume.

Dress really outrageously.,
The Bruno Walk is very poncy, oozing with confidence and perhaps a little stupid.,
Adopt a very camp German accent.,
Adopt some stereotypes.,
Always insist your age is 19, even though you may be older.

,
Be obsessed with being famous, stardom and Hollywood.,
Sing, Dance and Act really terribly, but actually believe that you are amazing and confront anyone who brands you a ""talentless idiot"", even if you are a really good singer, dancer or actor.

,
Don't take anything, except fame and your talent, seriously.,
Actually believe that you are famous, and go to funny, extraordinary lengths to avoid the ""waiting paparazzi"".,
Play loud, thumping Trance music wherever you go.,
Just generally be completely outrageous!",How to Imitate Bruno," Have a look at some pictures of Sacha Baron Cohen dressed as Bruno to get the idea. Anything animal print, suggestive, PVC and generally tabooed is good.;
, Don't be afraid to walk like a ponce! If you are, then this is how it's done.

, Bruno is actually Austrian, however the difference between accents is very small. Pronounce ""w"" as ""v"", ""r"" as ""w"", say ""Ich"" instead of ""I"", say ""mein"" instead of ""mine"", on words ending with ""s"" put ""sch"" on the end and instead of saying ""the"" say ""ze"". There are probably a few more, watch Bruno, or some interviews to get a good idea. There is also a section on the official website, called ""Discover Brunoisms"". I strongly suggest you check this out.

, Remember, Bruno is a stereotype, so don't be afraid to use them. Just be careful of actually offending someone too much, even Sacha Baron Cohen has his limits.

,, In the film, Bruno's ultimate aim is to achieve worldwide fame, and is pretty much obsessed with it.

,, Be really sarcastic to everyone about everything. However, if someone criticizes your talent, confront them.

, Hence, make a big entrance wherever you go and expect people to know who you are.

, European Dance bands and DJ's are good, such as Scooter (a lot of their music is in the film) and Basshunter, but anything goes!

Have the part go from your forehead down to the nape of your neck.This method is great for those who have very long hair, at least to elbow-length.;
, Grab the left side of your hair. Pull it up into a high pigtail, about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) above your ear. Tie it off with a hair tie that matches your hair color. Repeat the process for the right side of your head., Leave the other pigtail alone for right now. If you want a fancier Leia bun, braid the pigtail instead, then tie the end off with a clear hair elastic., Tuck the end of your hair under the bun after you coil it. Princess Leia's buns are not like regular buns. Instead, they are coiled in the same fashion as cinnamon buns. This is the effect you are aiming for., You will need a good amount of bobby pins to secure the style, otherwise the bun will fall apart.Plan on using one bobby pin every inch (2.54 centimeters). Be sure to use something that matches your hair color.

You may need to add some pins to the inside of the bun to help hold it together.

, Make sure that you wrap your pigtail in the same direction as the first one. For example, if you started wrapping your first pigtail towards the back of you head, you should wrap this one towards the back as well., Coil your bun in the same direction as you coiled the first one. This way they will match. For example, if you coiled the first bun away from your face, coil the second one away from your face as well., Now find some fellow rebels to overthrow the Empire with!"

Choose a character to cosplay.,
Plan your hairstyle.,
Make sure your costume is comfortable.,
Get any accessories or weapons.,
Do your makeup.",How to Dress for Your Next Cosplay," Choose your favorite character from your favorite anime, or choose someone more interesting. Pick a character with an awesome weapon or a cool outfit for the most fun cosplay experience. Get together with a group of friends and dress as the characters from a specific anime or manga, and act out scenes from the story while in character. Whatever you choose, do so well in advance, as you'll need plenty of time to plan and create your costume.;
, Many anime characters have long, dramatic hair, but there are also plenty of characters with shorter or mid-length hair. Some have perfectly straight hair, while others' hair is voluminous and curly. Think about your hairstyle. Decide whether you want to use your own hair or get a wig, and cut or dye your hair if necessary. Be creative and don't be afraid to go a little wild - in cosplay, hair comes in all colors, shapes, and sizes.

, It can be tempting to go all-out with style when designing your costume. However, while eight-inch heels may look awesome, they're not going to be that much fun to walk around in all day. Compromise on style if it allows you to be more comfortable. This way, you can enjoy wearing your costume and stay in it for longer. Make sure everything fits well, and break in shoes or other items that might give you blisters well before the day of your cosplay.

, This part is optional, but having appropriate accessories will give you an extra special look. You can carry LARP weapons like swords or even a replica gun. Decorate your weapon, staff, or other accessory to perfectly match your character's own. Make sure not to carry any real weapons, as these could be dangerous to yourself or others.

, Always go for a light makeup because too heavy will give you a fake, raunchy look that will detract from your cosplay. In fact, a good simple makeup will flaunt your beauty even if the costume or hairstyle is not that appealing. Mimic your character's makeup and use it to look more like your character, but remember not to go overboard with it.

Spray the buns lightly with hairspray.",How to Do Princess Leia Hair2," Comb through your hair to remove any knots or tangles. Use the handle of a rat-tail comb to create a neat, even center part, going from your forehead to the nape of your neck.This method works best on hair that's shoulder length.

, Gather all your hair on the left side of the part into a high pigtail. Position it about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) above your ear and secure it with a hair tie that matches your hair color. Do the same thing for the right side of your head.Make sure that the hair going into each pigtail is smooth and neat.

, Find a pair of clean socks that match your hair color. Cut the toes off, then roll each sock from top-to-bottom to form a doughnut shape.The socks need to be long enough to cover your ankle, otherwise your buns will turn out too small.

, Pull the entire pigtail through the sock bun first, then bring the bun towards the end of the pigtail. Set the other sock bun off to the side for now., Try to spread the hair as evenly as possible. Tuck them under the sock bun so that they are nestled between the bun and the body of the pigtail., This step can be tricky, and it may take you a few tries before you get the hang of it.

Be smart.,
Kourtney also has her phrases.,

Have a flawless skin, hair, nails, smell good and be clean.,
Be healthy.",How to Emulate Kourtney Kardashian," Kourtney is known for being really open-minded, confident and brave. She's not afraid to say what she thinks, but she's always being polite to others, people like her workers and assistants. She sometimes might not be so polite to Scott, or the rest of her family members, but only when she's in a fight with them. Kourtney is also great at expressing her feelings - she can perfectly describe what she feels about this or that, she's never afraid to say what's bothering her, but she never goes over the top. And THAT'S pretty amazing.;
, You would never see Kourt yelling at others. She's more of a person who would sit down and talk about things and problems very calmly and diplomatically. She also isn't very emotional - or at least she doesn't show it. You would never see her crying in front of others, she's really calm about things and she isn't the one who would suddenly become moody or depressed. She sometimes gets a bit dramatic - but she NEVER screams her head off or starts bawling and sobbing.

, Kourtney doesn't let everyone tell her off or make her do things she doesn't think that are right. She knows what she wants and she doesn't really care about what others think of it. She would never let anyone push her around. Though she still isn't always right and she knows it, so if she makes a mistake - she apologizes and admits that she was wrong. That's another great feature - being able to admit that you were wrong. But never let anyone tell you that you can't do it and put you down. Stick up for yourself and for the people you love - never let your loved ones be hurt.

, Kourtney is known to be really funny sometimes. Like, for example, when they were all in Bora Bora, and everyone came except from Khloe, and Kris started talking about her, Kourt was like: ""What? We have another sister?! How could you keep this from us, mom?!"", laughing. She tends to be pretty serious, but she knows how to do a great prank or laugh!

, Kourtney is hilarious sometimes, but she never goes over the top and she's never the one who gets into a scandal. She's not the major party animal, she doesn't get drunk, you won't see her being irresponsible or careless - she's really well organized and she knows her priorities.

, Kourtney is well-educated and smart. She's very polite, she has great manners.

, When she's pissed off, she usually says: ""Whatever"", ""You're so annoying"", ""I'm done with this conversation"", ""That's really not funny"", ""You've stepped over the top this time"" and ""I'm not sure whether I wanna be with you in this place right now"". Though she never yells, she just rather says it in an annoyed tone.

, Kourtney is VERY fashionable and stylish. Her outfits are very chic, she's always looking absolutely flipping gorgeous. Look over some stuff online and see her outfits - then try to copy some of them, adding a touch of your own style. For makeup - just don't go over the top. Kourtney is very classy/edgy. It depends, of course - she's sometimes wearing bold red lipstick, and sometimes she's just putting on some lip balm. But never go for the EMO or the goth looks, cause they're SO NOT Kourt.

, Just take care of yourself! Use products that are best for you, shower daily, do your manicure and pedicure, protect and style your hair, use deodorant, and drink MANY water!

, Don't starve yourself to lose weight and be skinny like Kourtney. That's not something she would do. Rather than that - eat healthier and exercise! Kourtney exercises, and she's not the one who'd eat hamburgers every day.

Start out with pale powder or foundation.,
Line the eyes at the top and bottom as well as the top of the eyelid with black or brown eyeliner, (Black will look more dramatic, but brown will look more natural.

,
Next put a circle of a light color on the center of the eyelid, and add a dark color before blending away at the harsh edges.,
Sweep a rust color into the natural dark circle area.,
Sweep lines of the same color on each side of the nose.,
Blush is right out when it comes to being a zombie, but to create a dramatic effect, suck in the hollows of the cheeks and sweep bronzer into the hollows of the cheeks.

,
Now for the lips.,
Now the fun part.,
Optionally, add a final coat of light powder over the face for a finishing touch.,
As far as clothing goes, start with plain tee-shirts and pants in dark colors and rip them up as desired.",How to Do Zombie Makeup and Costume," Spread it unevenly about the face and neck, and optionally spread it on the arms too.;
,, Optionally finish off the eyes by adding black or brown mascara.

, Feel free to enlarge it a bit to make it look more like a zombie's eyes. Blend away the harsh edges a bit, but leave the color still looking strong and sharp.

, Blend away. This gives the nose a sharp, pointy look.

,, Lip liner is optional, but a good idea. I used red. Having lined the lips, fill the lips in with black, blue, or purple lipstick or lip gloss. If using lipstick, feel free to add a dark color lip gloss over it to give it a glossy sheen.

, Add random splotches of color over the face, especially in blue and green. Also add red lip liner in crooked lines all over the face for marks of blood.

, Have fun with your new look.

, I recommend Generation T, a great book on how to take old Tee-shirts and transform them into new clothes. Have fun!

Wear costumes to match the style of the times.,
Dress as one of the street urchins.,
Wear a glamorous costume.,
Wear simple makeup or stage makeup.,
Do your hair.",How to Cosplay Characters from Little Shop of Horrors1," Little Shop of Horrors is set in the 1950s/1960s, where Motown and soul artists were popular. Look to Aretha Franklin, Etta James and the Supremes for inspiration, and wear suitable costumes to match this era and style. Try googling for images of these soul artists for inspiration.;
, Ronnette, Chiffon, and Crystal are first seen in street urchin clothing that presents them as quite poor. To get this look, wear denim waistcoats, dirty-ish cut-off jeans, striped shirts, sneakers, and a bandana around the neck.


If you're dressing up with a couple other people, make sure you each look similar but have a distinctive aspect. For instance, you could each wear a different color of bandana.

, So long as you don't go overboard, you can really go to town. However, bear in mind that, at this point in the 1960s, girls wouldn't have overly seductive, showy costumes, and remember that you aren't meant to be overly sexual. A good plan is to do a google image search for costumes to see what takes your fancy. Alternatively, a good costume guideline is a short sleeved or halter top dress with a relatively large, puffy knee length skirt (petticoats are a good plan here to create the cute 1960s puffy skirt look).

, If you're going to be onstage, wear a general base of stage make-up so that you don't look too pale in the spotlight. A little face powder, foundation, concealer, mascara and eyeliner should suffice, along with a little bit of red lipstick. If you're not going to be onstage, use only minimal amounts of makeup, if any. For more glamorous characters, add red lipstick and eyeshadow to match your costume.

, Pick one 1950s updo to wear with your costume. For instance, back-combing was very popular during the 1960s, so you can go for a nice beehive look or a back-combed french twist. However, this is a pain to do and takes ages, so an even easier idea is to tie the hair back in a huge, tight donut bun and add a nice colored bandana, tie it in a tight bow around the head, and allow bangs (side bangs are best, but if you have a fringe, that is fine too) to be let loose. If the bangs are a little bit tricky to manage, you can just pin them back a little and hairspray in place.

Find a regular beauty regime for your face, and stick to it. Deal with zits properly and make sure you are always fresh-faced. Poppy also has amazingly smooth skin. Wax or shave your legs and underarms, and shower once a day, with soap. Moisturize as soon as you get up in the morning (preferably with a scented lotion) and after your shower at night. Exfoliate once a week to get rid of yuck dead skin cells, and you should try out a body conditioner to give your skin a treat. It takes 21 days to develop a habit, and this is a habit you absolutely must have if you ever want a chance of being like Poppy Moore.;
, You need the beautiful, I-just-came-back-from-Hawaii glow. Never ever use tanning lotion! It is tacky and so not couture, but instead use expensive little self tanners like Poppy has. You could try sunbathing on a sunny day, just sprawl out on a towel and rotate sides every 15-20 minutes. Don't forget sunscreen! Poppy Moore may have an amazing tan, but she is never, ever seen with a burn or skin cancer!

, Poppy has a generally great body. Try to maintain a slim figure and a flat stomach. Work out only at the gym 3-5 times a week and work on all you muscles to keep them toned and tight. Run cardio for 20-40 minutes every day/second day to build endurance, and instead of a malnourished slim body, you will have a lean lithe one that Poppy has. Poppy is a pescetarian from Monday to Wednesday (this means are vegetarian except for fish, and in some cases, chicken) and a vegan from Thursday to Sunday (No animal products). Also, Poppy does a lot of sport at Abbey Mount, so you can do that instead of gym, but still keep the diet.

, She has a great style that's all hers. It is kitsch, new and totally her. Only wear designer clothes.

, They will help you and you will help them. Be able to tell if girls are just hanging out with you for money, status, etc. Get true friends that you fit in with and who truly like you for you.

, Poppy has little tanners, iPods, phones, laptops, and Macs. Try to get a phone and an iPod. Most of these things are obtainable. You can get tanners anywhere online.

, Poppy doesn't always have the cleanest room, but she hates regular people's germs. Always keep sanitizers with you on the go and big bottles at home.

, They'll always be able to keep in touch no matter what then.

, If you're having a bad day, write about it. If it's a good day, write about it too.

, Poppy can do anything when she sets her mind to it. Be able to create the cutest outfits and create for others.


But remember, don't change too fast! People may think of you as a wannabe.

Figure out your character's personality.,
Develop the idiosyncrasies of your character.,
Adopt an accents.",How to Cosplay Characters from Little Shop of Horrors2," Although several of the characters are quite similar, each has their own personality quirks and differences. For example, though Ronnette, Crystal, and Chiffon seem very similar, Ronnette is the leader, confident and smart, Crystal is witty and flirtatious, and Chiffon is the cute, funny, innocent baby.

, Each character has her own personality and has little habits that can be played up and down at times. For example, Chiffon can be a little nervy and will bite her nails, while Ronnette is quite loud and rolls her eyes a lot. Understand your character's personality and come up with little habits or tics to help you more fully embody the character.

, The characters can be played with plain American accents, but to make it a little more fun, you could even try doing a New York City accent and play that up to emphasize your character's personality. However, if you don't feel like you can do the accent particularly well, don't feel the need to do it! A bad accent can break a performance and slipping back into your real accent will make your character seem unbelievable and flat.

, Ed more or less always has his hair in a braid. Leave two sections of hair out in the front as his bangs, and hair spray them up. You could try teasing them up and shaping the bangs. Also, don't forget the antenna! You can use hairspray or gel to let a small part of the hair stick up.

,, Ed usually wears relatively tight, shiny black pants. Try leather, or satin. Both work, but satin is easier to move around in. He also wears a black tank top and a shiny jacket, as well as a large belt around the belly button area. It's suggested you make his one of a kind red coat yourself since online shops can make them look cheesy. Look up pictures of the coat and start drawing patterns to help you with the designing. Also, if you feel like being particularly accurate, get white dress gloves. You can usually find such gloves at costume stores, dress clothing stores etc. And, when you're done, you can re-purpose them into normal wear gloves, or even (with a bit of sewing, or even a red marker) into gloves for cosplaying as Mustang.

, If you are wearing the long red jacket, you might not need to have automail. However, if you do want the automail, there are some tutorials online, as well as some people who can do custom cosplay pieces. Just be prepared to pay at least $100 for the arm itself, as cosplay takes a lot of time and work for a quality piece. if you don't want to, just say you're from the ""promised day"" chapter.

, Whenever somebody refers to you as short, small and/or minuscule, overreact and over-exaggerate what they called you. Care for those close to you. Don't give up.

The skirt she wears in the movie is shades of navy; however, black should do just fine as well.

, In the movie, they're Nike, but if you don't feel like being a sell-out, there's always Payless. Try Claire's or Hot Topic for the socks--you should be able to find them there.

Get familiar with the bishie style.,
Menswear is a must!,
Unlike the usual ""tomboy"" attire, colors like pink or purples are not out of the question.,
You don't have to stop wearing make-up.,

, Look for men's slacks, pants, ties, suits, cuff links, watches, shirts and jewelry. Keep it classy and expensive looking. Even if you just spend 12.99 on one shirt, nobody should be able to tell by looking at your outfit. Be very careful that your clothes fit your body well. They shouldn't be too tight but the worst mistake would be to buy them too large. Baggy jeans and tees may sound like a good idea but lack the sophistication bifauxnen girls are trademarked for.

, The trick is to wear it in ways that does not enhance your femininity but instead confuses people even more about your gender!

Wear gloves that have faux snow on them.,
Wear all blue and white.,
Wear a simple necklace with a sophisticated charm.,
Act the part.,
Make the snow appear to ""come out of your hands"".,
While you're ""making snow"" always look as if you're truly enjoying yourself.,
Try this out on your friends before doing it at a fancy dress or cosplay event.",How to Appear to Have Snow Power," The artificial snow could be made from white/silver glitter, small cotton ball puffs, white rolls or yarn, sparkling white sequins, etc.; choose the one that works for you and either sew or glue the items in place.


You may be able to get black gloves for a dollar with snow on them already (from dollar stores).;
, These are the colors a snow character would be likely to prefer, representing the cold ice and snow of the area she or he comes from. Maybe a light blue dress with white stockings would look good. Or light blue jeans and a white sweater. And, if you can, add a light blue sweatshirt with a white hoodie. Also, when you ""make it snow"", wearing a long sash on your sleeves will give it a great effect. If the sashes have glitter, even better.

, Maybe a jeweled snowflake with simple white beads would be nice.

, Try to make someone curious enough to watch you. When you have their attention, make the snow appear to ""come out of your hands"". Use white glitter or similar to make it seem like snow.


If using real snow, this is best done during wintertime, to make it more believable (the snow would melt in summer).
When you're at your secret place, start to play around in the snow with your bare hands (if you can bear it) and throw it in the air. Do this for a few times then look at your hands. Smile and get ready to do your trick.

, If you have very large sleeves, you can try this neat trick. Get two small fans and secretly put them down your sleeves. Get some of the faux snow and put it on top of the fans. Turn on the fans secretly and open your hands wide, so that it goes through your fingers and appears to come out of your hands.


If you can't get the fans, don't worry, just stuff some of the fake in your sleeves and twirl around with your sleeves down, causing the snow to slip out of your sleeves.
Practice this a few times before the real deal, in a private place.

, Laugh a lot, and twirl around. When you twirl, if you're tied sashes to your costume, they will spin and enhance the ""magical"" effect.


If you're pretending to hide your snow powers, do the following: After you run out of snow, toss the snow on the ground in the air, then seem to notice the person. Start to look really worried, run up to the person and beg, ""Please don't tell anyone..."" and you're done.

, Listen to their suggestions for improving your performance. Then enjoy your time as a snow princess or prince!

Stand up for yourself.,
Pick up a sport.,
Be independent.,
Hang out with people you like.,
Be aware.",How to Act Like Sif from the Movie Thor," Remember, Sif is the only female in her group, so she is always willing to prove that she is as good as all the boys warriors around her. Meaning that you shouldn't be afraid to speak up your mind or take a challenge. You might as well earn more respect from other people like that. If you are too shy, then think to yourself: ""Hey, my ideas are as good as others !"" So don't be afraid and show people what you've got ! As an Asgardian, Sif is tough, confident and proud, don't let people push you around !;
, Sif is an Asgardian, meaning she has supernatural strength and fighting skills. She is shown to excel at hand-to-hand combat and likes to use cold weapons (such as swords). So you could pick taekwondo  classes or karate classes. If you prefer weapons, kendo or fencing would do the trick. If you don't like combat sports, anything that increases your strength or agility is fine! Don't forget to exercise regularly. On the top of that, it'll keep you in good health !

, Sif doesn't like to follow orders if she thinks they're wrong. Again, this matches step 1. For example, if someone tells you to do something that you feel bad about, argue a little. Listen to the person's opinion and don't always argue though ! What I'm saying is that you shouldn't be afraid to show the person that you're against the idea.

, One of the biggest problems in school is that there are a lot of clans, especially with girls. For example, students tend to judge you on how you look, and not on who you are. Sif wouldn't care about that. She hangs out with boys and likes fighting more than talking makeup and clothes. It doesn't mean that you shouldn't befriend girls ! It means that you should wear clothes you feel comfortable in and don't pretend that you like fashion if you don't. But on special occasions, wear dresses and more feminine outfit, so that boys don't think of you as a complete tomboy, but as a cool and fun girl !

, Sif is the first person to suspect Loki of treason, showing that she is very observant. Look beneath the looks and see if someone is trustworthy or not. You might even have a new (better) vision of your surroundings. Don't just burst out your crush's name or any secret ! It's your private life. Also, don't tell people that you're trying to act like Sif, they'll look down on you for that.

Have fun with your double life.",How to Act Like a Mermaid at School," There are all kinds of mermaids in folklore and fairy tales and their nature can range from tragically romantic to murderous. Are you the kind of mermaid that falls in love with sailors or the kind that tries to drown them? Are fish your best friends or a floating feast? Getting your story straight ahead of time will make it much simpler for you to practice your role and helps in getting people to take you seriously.;
, Start with the ancient myths about mermaids. Mermaid myths pop up all over the world, from Russia to Greece. Then move on to the realms of mermaid fiction.


Hans Christian Andersen's ""The Little Mermaid"" is widely considered to be the definitive mermaid tale.
Besides Andersen, take a look at Oscar Wilde's ""The Fisherman and his Soul,"" H.P. Lovecraft's ""The Shadow Over Innsmouth,"" Donna Jo Napoli's Sirena and Alice Hoffman's Aquamarine.


, Begin with Disney's version of The Little Mermaid. It's the most famous version of the Andersen story, and you'll have to be familiar with it if you want to be accepted as a mermaid.



Splash is a live-action film that shows the trials of turning into a mermaid every time you get wet, making it a good how-to-guide.

Aquamarine is another good choice.
Consider checking out Mr. Peabody and the Mermaid, Peter Pan, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, and She Creature.
Mermaids are less common on television but the Australian series H2O: Just Add Water provides a look at three young mermaids in high school trying to keep their magical powers secret.

, Mermaids are famous for their long, beautiful tresses. Consider adding hair extensions as well. Extensions come in all colors and adding a dramatic streak of blue or purple to your hair will give you the proper otherworldly look. However, make sure you aren't going against the school dress code when dyeing your hair.


Take good care of your hair by washing it at least three to four times a week. Brush it every morning and night, for mermaids love brushing their hair. Plus, it's good for your scalp and causes your hair to become healthier.
If your hair isn't already silky, try using a different shampoo type to get those desired results. Also, conditioner can help soften and strengthen your hair if you use the right amount.

Try purchasing tropical scented shampoos and conditioners that will instantly remind people of the sea.



, Start with some hair clips in the shape of sea creatures. Starfish, dolphins, fish and seahorses are all very popular. Look for necklaces, earrings, bracelets, and brooches with the same shapes.


If you can't find anything appropriate in local stores, a simple shell necklace is easy to find and will give the same effect. Make sure to always wear it over your clothing and not hide it underneath your shirt so people can easily see it.

Try to purchase a shell necklace that looks or is authentic. If this is impossible, go to the beach and find a small shell that you can hook a chain around it. Sometimes, there are small holes in the shells - usually found in the smaller shells - that is big enough to let a chain through, but small enough so that it doesn't crack the shell.
Don't wear the shell necklace when you go to sleep, or you might accidentally crack it in your sleep! Take it off before bedtime and showering so that you will preserve it well.



, Bright blues and greens are associated with the ocean, as well as anything turquoise or aqua. You don't have to stick to just those colors though; a flash of purple or orange will give your outfit a tropical look. Look at pictures of ocean life and try to copy some of those vivid colors and patterns.


Avoid wearing mermaid costumes to school because people will either think you're trying too hard or they won't take you seriously. However, do wear a mermaid costume if you go trick-or-treating on Halloween night, but don't overdo the look!

, Blues, greens, and purples will match your clothes and draw people's attention when you comb your fingers through your long hair.

, A subtle blue tint on your lips or in the outer corner of your eye will accentuate your outfit.


Try to avoid sparkly shades and glitter that could draw too much attention and make you look like you're trying too hard. Mermaids sometimes are shy and don't like to draw attention to themselves.

, When the subject of underwater life and the ocean comes up in class, act interested but informed, as if you are already an expert. Talk a little about fish, currents, and tidal waves. If your classroom has an aquarium, take it as an opportunity to be either mesmerized or insulted.


Be ready to point it out when others are mistaken but don't make a nuisance of yourself.

, A true mermaid would not be likely to enjoy having the secrets of her people discussed in public. Your silence on the subject will make people all the more intrigued. Although you might want to drop a subtle hint, along the lines of ""The Little Mermaid got it all wrong.""

, You don't have to run through the hallways screaming, but it doesn't hurt to act a little nervous and quickly dry yourself off. If you're not walking around with a mermaid tail 24/7 then you are most likely a mermaid that transforms at the touch of water. It makes sense for you to avoid transforming at school and acting the part will make it more real. If you have to come into contact with water, wear a special charm on your necklace or in your hair that you never remove, and drop hints about how it prevents you from transforming without saying it outright. It may help if your charm is sterling silver. This will be explained later.


If no one notices your nervousness at the touch of water, don't worry. Gradually, they probably will start to notice it. However, if you add more drama to it, people will think you're a drama queen and/or trying to get attention.

, Mermaids are known for their beautiful voices. If your voice is naturally good, show it off when you're listening to the car radio or hanging out in the choir room. If not, get some lessons in private and in the meantime, let others know that you're afraid to sing in public and let them draw their own conclusions as to why.


Avoid singing too much or people will think you're only trying to show others how good you are. Then, they'll start to ignore, avoid, and/or dislike you.
If worse comes to worse and you still can't develop your singing talent, don't worry. You don't have to sing to be a mermaid - just avoid singing and don't tell anyone about your voice.

, A true mermaid would be concerned at the destruction of her habitat. Join an environmental protection club or a pollution awareness campaign. Research the dangers of overfishing and oil spills. If you live near a beach, take part in clean-up projects.


Don't go overboard with this and lecture everyone about keeping marine life and the sea safe. Otherwise, people will find you annoying and think that you're only trying to get attention.

, Write down your experiences living underwater, transforming, and the trials of keeping your secret. You can choose to keep this book for yourself or take it to school and let others guess at the contents.


If you do choose to take your diary to school, be very protective about it and always have it with you in your sight. This will enhance the mystery and make people wonder what is in your diary.

If the students are desperate enough, they might try to steal it and peek inside, so you must keep it with you at all costs - unless your plan is to let them see it. However, this isn't recommended, as the other students might tease you about this and this could ruin your mermaid life.



, Before you go to sleep, try imagining yourself as a mermaid in the ocean. Listen for the sound of the waves. Picture yourself surrounded by schools of fish or running your hands over a cluster of coral. Feel your body swaying in the pull of the tides. These exercises will spill over into your dreams. Don't be surprised if you wake up feeling like you've just been for a long swim!

, Visit the sea whenever you can and swim in it. Act like you are at home and if you do feel at home, this should be easy for you! Linger in the water for as long as you can and run your hands through it to show how much you love it. When you have to leave, reluctantly pull away, but don't delay for too long or you could become annoying.


If you live near the beach and you are allowed to visit it whenever you please, go visit it whenever you can! The more often you hang out at it, the more likely people will think that you truly are a mermaid.
If you don't live anywhere near the beach, visit the pool and swim in it as much as you can. Avoid swimming in the pool when people - stranger or friends - are around and immediately leave. If you have no option but to swim with others, wear your charm in the pool with you. Only do this if it is sterling silver, as it will not discolour or rust.

When you're alone in the pool, practice swimming like a mermaid. Then, show off your moves at the beach whenever you can visit it!



, If you drop too many hints or act too self-important, people will start to get irritated. The point of this is to become a mermaid, not to alienate your friends. Try sticking to a few subtle hints and some basic costuming every day, instead of going for the full effect all the time.

, If you start to feel bored or uncomfortable in your role, then maybe it's time to take a break. Remember that being a mermaid is about having fun. You're living in two worlds now, but don't let it become a chore. This is for your enjoyment only.

Obtain takeoff clearance from the tower or announce your intentions on the Common Traffic Advisory Frequency (CTAF), taxi onto the runway and align the plane with the center-line.,
If acceleration from the hold short line is not possible, taxi to the takeoff end.,
Smoothly apply full power and release the brakes once the RPM is in the green arc.

,
Keep the plane centered with the rudder pedals.

,
By the point of time you reach about 20% below rotation speed, set the flaps to the takeoff position.

,
Once rotation speed is reached gently pull back on the yoke .,
If the density altitude and gross weight are both climb at the best angle of climb speed, Vx, which can also be found in the POH.,
Enter the pattern as you would at any airport after contacting the tower or announcing your position on the CTAF.

,
Fly the standard traffic pattern, beginning your descent on the downwind leg abeam the touchdown point of the runway.,
Turn final to align the plane with the runway and lower flaps completely (30° or 40° depending on the aircraft).

,Don't forget to lower your gear if your aircraft has a retractable undercarriage

,
Fly the approach using a point just before the threshold as your reference.,
Raise the flaps and apply maximum braking without locking the wheels.,
Exit the runway to make room for other aircraft traffic.

",How to Takeoff and Land on a Short Runway," Taxi as close to the takeoff end of the runway as this allows you to use all the length of the runway. With some very short runways it may be helpful to start acceleration at the hold short line of the runway thus arriving speed at takeoff end of the runway with ten or fifteen knots of airspeed already developed.;
, Apply your toe brakes and leave the flaps in 0° position.

,,,, This speed, called Vr, can be found in the Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH).

, This speed will give you the most climb over distance only until energy (airspeed) bleeds off. At that point you must reduce the angle to maintain the vx speed that is in the POH

,, Don't forget to lower 10° of flaps. When the runway is 45° over your shoulder, turn base and lower another 10° of flaps.

,,, Maintain awareness for power lines, trees, fences, or other obstructions with short field techniques. Use power to maintain glide slope and elevator to maintain a speed that will not allow this point to appear to speed up or slow down. A couple feet before the edge of the runway, pull the power back to idle and gently flare to lose airspeed and touch down on the numbers.

, Apply full back pressure on the yoke to keep the weight on the main gear.

"
Use a preflight checklist if you have one.,
Begin your preflight in the cockpit, since before flying, you will need to make sure all cockpit equipment is operating, and the fuel tanks have sufficient fuel for your flight.,
Exit the aircraft.,
Walk around the aircraft, looking for damage cause by impacts or cracks and seams separating from airframe fatigue, hard landings, or other mishaps.

,
Begin at the right wing, after exiting the aircraft, and look at the forward wing surface for nicks, loose fasteners, dents, or other damage.,
Remove the fuel cap (for wing fuel tanks) and visually confirm they have sufficient fuel to make your flight.,
Check stall indicator (depending on which wing it is mounted on), struts, if applicable, and other features on the right wing.

,
Move down the right side of the aircraft.,
Move to the tail assembly.,
Look at the antennae assembly, which is usually located at the tail, as well as the tail wheel, to be sure no lubricants or brake fluid is leaking, and that the tire is properly inflated.,
Move to the opposite side of the aircraft, continuing to look over the aircraft skin to the wing.,
Move to the front of the aircraft and look at the exhaust; looking for oil blow-out and other damage.

,
Check the engine oil, the ignition wires, magneto electrical connections, and the fuel lines and other hoses to be sure they are seated properly and tightly clamped.,
Move to the propeller.,
Check for fuel or lubricant leaks around the engine compartment, cowling, and fuel tank locations.,
Take a look at the wheels, landing gear, and landing gear compartment doors.,
Remove the wing tie downs and wheel chocks, walk to the front of the aircraft, and take a long, careful look to make sure you have not overlooked anything.

",How to Pre Flight an Aircraft," Many rental or fleet aircraft have one which may have all recent service, inspection, and maintenance information updated for each aircraft. Here are some things you may see:


Flight hours. Because aircraft maintenance is usually scheduled at flight hour intervals, the actual hours flown are logged to accommodate scheduling service dates for these activities.
Pilot observations. When more than one pilot is likely to operate an aircraft, it is beneficial to have input from each pilot as to the flight characteristics of the plane. One pilot may notice a vibration, shudder, or other physical anomaly, or unusual readouts from gauges while in flight, that the next pilot should be aware of.
Service schedule. If a component (airframe, engine, etc) has a scheduled 100 hrs inspection due after 5 more flight hours, a longer flight could be postponed until the service is performed, or another aircraft utilized.;
,


Make sure the aircraft registration, certification, and other paperwork is in the cabin and up to date.
Make sure the ignition switch is in the off position.
Turn on the master power switch.
Check the fuel gauges. If the fuel is low, call for the service truck to bring your fuel out while you continue to do the rest of your checks.
Listen to the sounds of equipment powering on. Radio cooling fans, instrument gyros, and other equipment make noticeable sounds, and when unusual sounds are heard, it may be a warning an instrument or radio could fail in-flight.
Check flaps, landing gear lockdown levers, and other flight controllers for smooth, normal function.

,


As you climb out of the cabin, take a look at the seat support rails (on small aircraft) to make sure the seat is anchored securely and all fasteners are in place.
Check the cabin door to be sure it operates smoothly and shuts securely. Worn hinges or latches that do not secure properly can cause an inflight emergency. If the door does not move smoothly into open and closed positions, it may indicate the airframe and internal structure are damaged.

,, Look at the flight control surfaces, flaps, and ailerons. Make sure that items are secure and have no loose fasteners.

, Replace the fuel cap securely.

,, Continue looking at the aircraft surface. Be particularly careful to observe defects or loose fasteners in the aircraft surface.

, While at the tail, you may remove the wheel chock or tail tie-down. Look at the elevators and the rudder. As with all control surfaces, these should be tight, with no loose motion or free play.

, Give the gear suspension a once-over, too, making sure any boots or covers are in place, and that all support cables are tight.

, Remove the fuel cap and look into the tank to be sure it is fueled, replace the tank cap securely, and check out the control surfaces (again, the ailerons and flaps).

,, Look at the alternator belt to make sure it is tight, and the air intake to be sure it is not obstructed.

, Never place your body in the swing radius of an airplane propeller. Check the ""spinner"" for lubricant leaks, missing bolts and pins, or other problems. Look at the propeller itself, to be sure the blades are not cracked, bent, delaminated, or damaged in other ways.

, Any leaks or appearance of fluid on the aircraft skin should be inspected by a trained maintenance person prior to flight.

, Look for loose fittings, tires which may have tread separation, low inflation pressure, and other defects.

While taxiing, apply full back pressure on the yoke (pull it towards you) to relieve the pressure on the nose wheel.,
If you can, don't stop at the hold short line (only if you have permission to do so and traffic conditions allow for it).,
Once you have obtained clearance (only at towered airports), taxi onto the runway and align on the center-line.

,
Do not stop.,
The nose will begin to rise.,
The plane will takeoff on its own.,
As the speed increases, you will need to apply even more forward pressure on the yoke.,
Once you reach a safe airspeed (usually the best rate of climb also known as Vy), raise the nose and climb, maintaining Vy.,
Enter the pattern as you would at any airport after contacting the tower or announcing your position on the CTAF.

,
Fly the standard traffic pattern, beginning your descent on the downwind leg abeam the touchdown point of the runway.,
When the runway is 45° over your shoulder, turn base and lower another 10° of flaps.

,
Turn final to align the plane with the runway and lower flaps completely (30° or 40° depending on the aircraft).,
Once you are a couple feet above the runway, gently flare and add a little bit of power.,
As soon as the main gear touches the runway, pull the power back to idle.

,
Apply full back pressure on the yoke to keep the nose wheel off the ground.,
Holding full back pressure, taxi off the runway to make room for other traffic.",How to Takeoff and Land on a Soft Runway," Keep the braking to a minimum as much as possible so you can keep your inertia. Depending on conditions you may want to lower your flaps to 10° at this point.;
, Always obey the controller if at a towered airport. Look for traffic approaching to land. Lower the flaps to 10° if you haven't already. When all is clear, radio the tower or announce your intentions on the Common Traffic Advisory Frequency (CTAF). CTAF is used at non-towered airports or when the tower is closed.

,, As soon as you are lined up, smoothly apply full power and continue to hold the yoke back.

, Continue to hold back pressure to keep the nose wheel off the ground. The cowling should be aligned with the horizon.

, Quickly, but smoothly, apply forward pressure to lower the nose. The plane is off the ground but does not have enough lift to fly. This is called Ground Effect. It feels as if the plane is flying on a cushion of air between the wings and the ground (although this is not really the case at all--that feeling is caused by the ground interfering with the wingtip vortices/down wash, reducing overall drag and therefore increasing airplane performance). If you go too high, you will lose this cushion, the drag will increase thus decreasing airplane performance and lift, and you may crash. Try to keep you altitude above the runway approximately equal to your wingspan.

, You will feel like you are flying in a nose low pitch attitude--and you are!

, This information can be found in your Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH).

,, Don't forget to lower 10° of flaps.

,, Once you have the runway made, pull the throttle to idle.

, Adding a little power at this point allows you slow your decent rate, and keeps you from slamming into the ground and flipping the plane. It also allows you to touch down at a slower airspeed making for a softer landing.

,, Allow it to settle on its own.

, You may need enough speed to avoid settling and getting stuck - use caution!

Wear whimsical clothes.,
If you have to wear a school uniform.,
Use natural makeup.,
Draw people in.,

Love nature and the world.,
Surprise your teachers with your knowledge of many subjects.,
If you are made fun of, don't give a ""Hey"".,
Elves love music.",How to Act Elven at School," Try wearing gypsy-style or bohemian clothing. For a forest elf, green, brown, blue, silver, white and beige are good colors to start with. Make sure they fit on you. Also, peasant tops and maxi skirts are a great choice. Sandals in the summer and ankle or knee long boots are good for winter. Animal prints like zebra and leopard are a bad idea. Let your hair grow long and keep it down or in a bohemian style in a natural hair color not too far away from your own as this can look unnatural.;
, This restricts you greatly in the clothes department but you can still work the look. Wear (if you can) more floaty, lightweight skirts and not too short (elves are modest and elegant). Move away from chunky, stocky clothing and try to keep it as elegant as you can. Accessories are helpful: wear delicate silver necklaces, rings or bracelets but do not go overboard. Clipping tiny flower clips or wearing a flower head circlet is perfect for this look so long as it doesn't clash with your uniform. Shoes should not make noises as elves are known for being silent in their movement.

, An elf does not have cakey makeup. They are subtly beautiful. Use eyeliner, light eyeshadow, loose powder, and lip balm. Stick to light colors, like pale blues, greens, lavender, white, and silver. If you feel braver, use brown. Go light.

, You want your classmates to flock to you. Be mature, slightly withdrawn and quiet but friendly,walk, talk, breathe musically. Be elegant and loyal to your friends. Keep in control of your emotions, don't get angry easily, but if you do, let it be known. Always be ready to help others: give them kind and wise words but do not order them what to do and do not become a slave to others yourself.

, Elves are always quiet.

, Express it in art class. You may also want to give up meat as Elves love and respect animals.

, Elves are well educated, smart, and have a vast knowledge of various things and workings of the world.

, Also, do not be angry. Elves are beyond child-like bullies and do not give them the satisfaction of their anger. However, this does not mean you cannot stick up for yourself, but in doing so, remain calm and collected and if things persist, inform the powers that be.

, pick up an instrument and join a choir and or band and participate in musical events at school. Great instruments to learn are the flute, piano, violin etc (anything with a pretty sound, veer away from brass instruments).

Begin with locating a single radio source by looking first to the ADF control panel (Figure 2) to select the proper setting; push the button labeled 'ADF'.,
Next, select the radio station you wish to locate based on those selected for your flight path in your previously determined flight plan, and utilize the tuning knob (seen on panel in Figure 2) in order to tune into that station's frequency.

,
At this point, in aircraft where it is automated (as it is in the majority of newer models), the aircraft's loop antenna (Figures 3 & 4), contained in a casing often found on the underside of the aircraft, will receive the signal being projected from the station it is tuned into and produce an audio output for the you or your navigator to hear, in the form of Morse code.

,
The designation for the station being received comes through as a series of short and long beeps, representing the dots and dashes involved in Morse code, which you or your navigator must interpret with the purpose of confirming the station.

,
Once this is confirmed, the one interpreting the signal must look to the RMI, which will at this point indicate on the compass the bearing of the station in degrees with regards to the aircraft's relative position (Figure 5).

,
Once the bearing is read, record it on a navigation chart for further reference.

,
In order to continue on to find the aircraft's position, you, the pilot, or your navigator must then select the frequency of a second station, using the same method as with the first.,
Determine the bearing of the second station; the thinnest needle will remain tuned into the first frequency, and the second and thickest needle on the RMI will indicate the new bearing, also in degrees.

,
Read the bearing, then be plot it onto the navigation chart with the first.

,
With the bearings of both stations determined, you must now draw straight lines from both locations to indicate the headings of the radio signals.,
In order to track the positioning of the aircraft throughout flight, repeat the above steps in the same manner, accounting for the change in frequency with each new radio station.

Determine the Holding Fix.,
Visualize the Holding Course.,
Draw the Holding Pattern.,
Determine the correct Entry Procedure.,
Time the legs.,
Watch your speed.",How to Fly a Holding Pattern1," Air Traffic Control (ATC) will give you instructions to ""hold north of SKIER intersection as published"" or give you specific holding instructions such as ""hold south-east of Falcon VOR on Victor 366, left turns."" The holding fix can be identified on an instrument flying chart and will usually be an intersection of Victor Airways (pre-established flying routes between VOR navigational aids), a VOR (Very high frequency OmniRange station), or an NDB(NonDirectional Beacon).

, This is the position in relation to the holding fix that ATC would like you to hold at. They may say ""hold west on Victor 8"" or ""hold on the Kremmling 260° radial."" You should be very familiar with VOR and NDB radials and bearings before flying holding patterns.
The holding course is the course to fly ""to"" the station. This will always be the reciprocal of the radial or bearing ""from"" the station (eg the 260° radial would result in a 080° Holding Course). To quickly identify this, take a piece of paper and put a dot for the Holding Fix and draw a line in the direction of the radial or airway to hold on. Place an arrow pointing to the station to identify the Holding Course.

, Once you have the Fix and Course, mentally or physically draw a picture of the holding pattern. You will need to determine if it is Standard or Non-standard. A standard pattern turns are to the right, while non-standard turns are to the left. If the pattern is non-standard, it will be published on the chart as left turns or ATC will say ""non-standard pattern"" or ""left turns.""
Starting at the Holding Fix, draw a 180° turn in the direction specified (left or right), continue the line paralleling the Holding Course, and draw another 180° turn to bring you back to the Holding Course. This is the famous ""racetrack"" or Holding Pattern.

, Depending on where you enter the holding pattern, you will need to follow an entry procedure. If you are coming from 70° to the left (right for non-standard patterns) of the holding course, use a Teardrop procedure. Coming from 110° to the right (or left if non-standard), use the Parallel procedure. And from the remaining 180°, fly a direct entry. The entry procedures are outlined below:



Parallel Procedure. When approaching the holding fix from anywhere within sector (a), turn to a heading to parallel the holding course outbound on the non-holding side for the appropriate time (see step 5), turn in the direction of the holding pattern through more than 180 degrees, and return to the holding fix or intercept the holding course inbound.

Teardrop Procedure. When approaching the holding fix from anywhere in sector (b), turn outbound to a heading 30° from the holding course on the holding side for the appropriate time, then turn in the direction of the holding pattern to intercept the inbound holding course.

Direct Entry Procedure. When approaching the holding fix from anywhere in sector (c), fly directly to the fix and turn to follow the holding pattern.

, The pattern should be flown so the Inbound Leg is one minute long if you are flying at or below 14,000 feet (4,267.2 m) Mean Sea Level (MSL) or one and a half minutes above 14,000 feet (4,267.2 m) MSL. At the holding fix, make a 180° standard rate turn (3°/sec) in the direction specified for the pattern (standard or non-standard). When you are abeam the holding fix (or after rolling out of the turn if you are unable to determine abeam the fix), start timing the outbound leg. After a minute (1½ minutes above 14,000ft), make another 180° turn in the same direction to intercept the holding course. Time the inbound leg until reaching the holding fix. If there is little or no wind, it should be one or 1½ minutes as appropriate. If not, you will need to adjust the outbound leg to make the inbound leg the appropriate time. For example, if you are flying at 12,000 feet (3,657.6 m) and find that it takes 45 seconds to fly the inbound leg after flying outbound for one minute, make your outbound leg 1 minute and 15 seconds next time. Similarly, if the inbound leg comes out as 1 minute 30 seconds, shorten the outbound leg by the extra 30 seconds.Remember not to start timing the outbound leg until you are directly abeam the holding fix.

, Unless otherwise depicted on a chart or directed by ATC, maximum holding airspeed between the minimum holding altitude and 6,000 feet (1,828.8 m) is 200 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS). Between 6001 and 14,000 feet (0.0 m), don't fly faster than 230 KIAS and above 14,000 feet (4,267.2 m), maximum airspeed is 265 KIAS.

"
"
Adjust for wind to make the inbound leg the appropriate time.,
Triple your crosswind correction on the outbound leg.",How to Fly a Holding Pattern2," If the inbound leg is shorter than it should be, lengthen the outbound leg by the difference. If the inbound leg is too long, shorten the outbound leg by the excess time. For example, flying below 14,000 feet (4,267.2 m), if the inbound leg takes one minute, 45 seconds to complete, time the outbound leg for 15 seconds (one minute minus the extra 45 seconds from the inbound leg).;
, If you have a 10° crosswind correction to hold your track on the inbound leg, fly the outbound leg with 30° correction. Maintain standard rate turns.

"
"
Some holding patterns require the use of Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) or GPS Along-Track Distance (ATD).,
Enter the pattern as appropriate (teardrop, parallel, or direct).

,
Start the turn to the outbound leg at the specified DME/ATD fix.

,
End the outbound leg and turn to the inbound leg at the required distance instead of timing the leg.",How to Fly a Holding Pattern3," The basics are the same as above except a DME distance is used as the holding fix.,,, For example, if you are holding on the 10DME fix to the navaid and flying 5 mile (8.0 km) legs as directed by ATC, you would end the outbound leg at 15 miles (24 km) DME (see diagram above).
If you are holding away from the navaid, subtract the length of the legs from the holding fix. For example, if you are holding on the 20DME fix and flying away from the navaid, end your outbound leg at 25DME."
"
Tune and identify.,
Get your bearing.",How to Navigate Using a VOR1," Tune the VOR frequency in the navigation radio. It will be listed on VFR and IFR charts as well as instrument approaches if it is a part of the approach. Identify that you have the correct station and the signal is reliable by listening to the Morse code identifier. If you see a red “NAV” or “VOR” flag, barber pole, or OFF instead of a TO/FR indication, the signal is unreliable, you are overhead, or roughly 90º from the selected radial. The signal is unreliable when you cannot hear the Morse Code identifier. A red “GS” flag is not a VOR indication.

, Determine which radial you are on by turning the OBS (Omni Bearing Selector) knob until the CDI (Course Deviation Indicator) needle is centered and you have a FROM indication.


Looking at the picture above, you can see that the needle is centered and the instrument gives a FROM indication (as a small white triangle is showing and pointing down); so the aircraft is on the 254 degree radial. It doesn't matter what the heading of the aircraft is; it is located somewhere along a line 254° from the VOR station. In order to fly to the VOR station, you would first twist the OBS knob until the needle is centered and the white triangle appears, next to the ""TO"" designator (in the opposite direction, or up, from the ""FR"" designator). Note that this will be 074 degrees, exactly 180° from the current radial. Now turn the aircraft to this new heading and keep the needle centered -- this will take you to the VOR station.

"
"
Fly the direction of the desired radial.,
Intercept the course.,
Track the radial.,
Adjust for wind.",How to Navigate Using a VOR2," You can find the direction of an airway on either a VFR or IFR chart. Set the radial's direction into the OBS and turn the aircraft to fly that heading. Once established on the heading, note the position of the CDI. If it is to the right, your radial is to the right. Likewise, if it is left, the radial is left.;
, Turn 30 degrees in the direction of the CDI to intercept the course. Although 30° is most common and easy to use, you can use any intercept angle. For instance, if you are far enough from the desired course, it may take more than 30° to intercept the course before reaching your destination.

, As the CDI moves close to the center, turn your heading to match the radial. Keep the needle centered to stay on the radial. If the needle starts drifting left, turn left to get back on course.


Tracking inbound (towards the station) and outbound (away from the station) radials is exactly the same, except you should get a TO indication when flying inbound and a FROM indication when flying outbound on a radial. (Aircraft heading opposite the direction of the radial will experience “reverse sensing” which is the CDI indicating right when the radial is to the left, and indicating left when the radial is to the right).

, If you find yourself blown off the radial by the wind, note the amount of deflection, then intercept the radial by turning the aircraft towards the radial twice as many degrees as the deflection. When the needle centers, turn only halfway back to the original heading to provide a wind correction angle (WCA).

"
"
Tune and identify both VORs just as before.,
Set the OBS.,
Wait for both CDI needles to center.",How to Navigate Using a VOR3," Two VOR receivers are best, but you can still identify an intersection with one VOR by switching the frequency and comparing the radials of both VORs.

, Use the OBS to set the correct radials from each VOR. The radials will be displayed on VFR and IFR charts if they are Victor airways, but any two intersecting radials may be used. On VFR charts, the arrows identifying the intersection point to the VOR, while the arrows on an IFR chart point from the VOR toward the intersection.

, While tracking the course on one VOR, watch the other VOR to see when the CDI centers. When both needles are centered, you are on the intersection.


If DME equipped and using a VOR/DME or VORTAC, use DME to eliminate the need for a second VOR. While tracking the VOR radial, use the DME to find your distance from the station. DME distances will be displayed on IFR charts when it can be used to identify an intersection. For example, WARIC intersection is defined by the 238 radial from the VOR and the 21 nm DME fix.

"
"
Mentally go over exactly what you will say before touching the radio and keep it in mind.,
Determine your position.,
Acquire necessary information.,
Communicate your request in a professional and organized manner.,
Read back any important information to ensure you received the correct message.",How to Communicate with an Air Traffic Control Tower,";
, If you are on the ground, you will need to tell the controller exactly where you are (eg. Alpha Taxiway, General Aviation Ramp, Gate 5, Runway 20, Parking Spot 2). Look for the black and yellow position signs. If you are in the air and approaching the airport, determine the distance, MSL altitude and bearing (east, north, southeast, northwest, etc.) from the field. Make sure you contact the tower and establish two-way communications before entering class D or C airspace and obtain a clearance before entering class B airspace.

, If you are calling tower approaching the field or talking to ground control with a request to taxi, you will need the current ATIS information if available. Also, prepare the frequencies you will need ahead of time (ATIS/AWOS, Clearance Delivery, Ground, Tower, Approach Control, Departure). Set the next frequencies in the standby radio or write them on a paper easily accessible to you in the cockpit.

, The standard format is Who you're calling, who you are (callsign), Where you are, and what you want. For example, ""Heathrow ground, Cessna Golf Echo Golf November Romeo, on west apron, with information Tango, request taxi for V-F-R flight departing to the south.""

, This includes all hold-short instructions, takeoff/landing clearance (include specific runway), frequency changes, IFR clearances, etc. For example, ""Los Angeles tower, Mooney Niner One Seven Victor, cleared to land runway two five left."" Remember this.

, You should know how far and how long you have to drive in advance., You should know how many days your Convention is and if it runs 24 hours or if it closes at a specific time.

, The cost of your pass will vary depending on the convention and its duration. You may preorder your pass online or you also have the option for you to purchase your pass at the door.

, You should already have a budget that accounts for your convention pass, emergencies, food, transportation, and (if applicable) lodging. Keep additional funds for purchases at bazaars and vendors. That sell an array of items, clothes, and paraphernalia for your fandom. , To attend a convention you should always wear comfortable walking shoes and layers. You will want to be able to adjust your outfit accordingly to both very cool and very warm situations, given that you will be in both open and enclosed spaces with mixtures of large crowds of people.Plan out your cosplay: You want to completely embody a character of your choosing? Plan your cosplay well in advance. This may require wigs (or hair dye), prosthetics, heels or bare feet, masks, full body suits, large props (depending on your character), and outfits made out of a large amount of material or little to no material at all. Be sure to have comfortable clothes with you in case you wish to change at any time. Make sure that all your props can fit within your mode of transport., You can be at conventions for hours without returning home or to your hotel room. Your convention survival kit will have specific items that go beyond general necessities, but will increase the comfort and ease in which you attend the convention.


A Convention Survival Kit should contain:

A small backpack. A small backpack will be able to hold personal supplies that you bring, your schedules and maps, in addition to most items you purchase while at the convention.Convention pass. Place your pass in a lanyard that you can wear around your neck to limit your chances of losing it. Insure you have this before you arrive at the convention, as you cannot even attempt to enjoy the festivities if you don't have the pass to allow you entrance.
Schedules and maps. Maps are especially important when attending a convention in an unfamiliar place or location. You will want schedules so that you know what and when things are happening around you in the convention.Refillable water bottle and snacks. Keep your own water in preparation for when you are tired and exhausted. Convention food will always be expensive. Carry your own convenient (preferably resealable) personal snacks. You may also want to map out alternative food areas as an alternative.Portable phone charger. Have a portable phone charger that you can plug into your phone so that you are allowed to charge your device without being immobilized by a wall outlet.Deodorant. Even if you apply before it before you leave, carry it with you always. Do yourself and the people in your immediate area a favor and be prepared. You will understand the necessity when you encounter others who have forgotten to bring theirs, or to put any on to begin with.Your schedule. Your specific schedule should be pre-planned by you to see what events and what times you want to attend. Your schedule can maximize the experience that you get out of your convention by letting you participate in things that interest you., Make an effort to arrive to the convention 30 minutes or more before it begins. Recall that there will be a large amount of people attending the convention.Even if you purchase your pass in advance, you want to cut down on the amount of time that you wait in line. It will enable you to be the first at certain quality vendors that may sell out, events that may fill up, or games that they have early that will be gone later in the day.
If you don't purchase your pass in advance, definitely arrive no less than an hour before the convention begins so that you can be one of the first to receive your pass without waiting for hours in line.

, In the bazaar there will be a vast amount of people, cosplayers, venders, and props everywhere and it may seem overwhelming.


Decipher the way venders are arranged. They will most likely be in rows and columns, or specifically squared of sections with venders of similar materials located in the same area.
If arranged in columns and rows, venture down one the row closest to the door you enter. Once you reach the end, turn around and travel down the same row in the opposite direction. This will allow you to see all the vendors have to offer without tearing your attention between the two sides. Once you reach the end, you can turn and go down the next row.

, Looking at the schedule you planned out before the convention, you should have developed priorities for what you want most out of your convention experience. Among the many panels, parties and events, you will have picked out ahead of time the few that you wish to attend and participate in. These are the parts of the convention where you can actively participate in things tailored specifically to your fandoms and interests. Plan them out accordingly.

, Engaging with anyone is absolutely your choice. However, some cosplayers put a great amount of time, effort, and money, into their costumes and outfits so that you will interact with them. Cosplayers can be solo, or travel in a pack with other cosplayers for a full cast affect. It is one of the most intricate and interesting parts of conventions.Ask permission. The more accurate, intricate, or expensive a cosplay seems to be, the more likely that person would be open and willing to take a photo for or with you. However, they also cosplay for their own enjoyment. Make sure that you gain consent before you assume that someone would be willing to pose for you., You will have arrived at your convention early and remained all day with little to no breaks- its okay to leave an hour or two early. With the schedule that you developed, you should have managed to visit, experience, and purchase a majority of everything that you wanted from the convention. Leave early to avoid crowds on the way home.

, If you were dropped off, call the person to come you pick you up a half an hour or so in advance. Be mindful that they have to navigate the traffic with hundreds of people coming and going from the convention. Give them time to navigate safely and still come pick you up when you're ready to go.

, Before you leave, make sure that everyone you came with is also ready to go. You don't want anyone to be left behind and you also want to make sure that the rest of the group has managed to complete their convention tasks as well.

, By the time you return home, you will have the strong smell of victorious convention survival. As great as it may seem, immediately take a show and wash it away (there will be other conventions and smells for you to encounter). At the end of the day, the convention adrenaline that you have should be fading and you will be completely exhausted. Get a good nights rest! You've earned it by surviving your first nerd convention. Get up the next day and do it again.

If you prefer a less traditional system, you may alphabetize the books by title.;
, Depending on the size and scope of your collection, it may make sense to sort your collection into very specific categories. These may include fantasy, mystery, cookbooks, history, anthropology, art and art history, and or science.Alternatively, you could sort the books by reading level (children, young adult, adult)., If your top priority is to create an aesthetically pleasing display with your books, consider sorting them by color or height.


Group the books by black, white, reds, oranges, yellows, greens, blues, indigos, and violets. When you are ready to stage your shelves, you can color block your books.
Line your books up from tallest to shortest or group books of similar heights together., Use your books to create a timeline of literature and/or civilization. You may place the books in order of their publication date or you may organize the books by order of when the subjects lived, events occurred, or ideas originated., While you may choose to rely on only one method of organization, most collections are sorted by two or more methods. For example, you may choose to sort your books by genre and then place each genre in alphabetical order. Alternatively, you could sort your books by color and then place them on the shelf by order of height."
"
Select a cataloging system.,
Learn about the Dewey Decimal Classification system.,
Learn about the Library of Congress Classification system.",How to Organize Books2," There are two primary cataloging systems: the Dewey Decimal Classification system (DDC) and the Library of Congress Classification system (LCC). In 1876, Melvil Dewey developed the DDC system. Today, it is the most common cataloging system in the world. This system provides the perfect amount of details for small libraries and book collections. If you are looking for a system that generates a more detailed call number, consider using the LCC system. In 1891, the Library of Congress developed its own system of classification. In order to keep track of its enormous collection, it needed a system that was more specific than Dewey’s. The LLC system is used by major research libraries., The DDC system organizes books by main class, division, and section. Every call number also includes a Cutter Number to identify the author and the edition date.


Main Class: 800 (Literature)
Division: 10 (American Literature in English)
Section: 3.54 (American Fiction in English)
To get the call number, add up the three numbers: 800+10+3.54=813.
Following this number, you may add a Cutter Number to identify the author (the first letter of the author’s last name) and the edition date. When this information is added, the call number becomes: 813.54 M 2007., The LCC system catalogues books by class, subclass, and topic area. Every call number also includes a Cutter Number to identify the author, a Cutter Number to identify the title, the edition date.


Class: P (Language and Literature)
Subclass: R (English Literature)
Topic Area: 9199.3 (Provincial, Local, etc.)
Cutter Number, Author: M3855
Cutter Number, Title: L54
Edition Date: 2007
Additional Information: c.2
To construct the call number, list the components sequentially like so: PR9199.3.M3855.L54.2007.c.2."

Set aside books to donate or sell.,
Box up the books you want to donate or sell.,
Complete an initial sort of your keep pile.,
Finalize the order of your books.",How to Organize Books3," Pull your books off the shelves and out of storage. As you sort through your entire collection, divide the items into three piles: a keep pile, a donate pile, and a sell pile.


Reasons to keep a book:

It is rare or collectable
It is by your favorite author
It is a book you have not read yet
It is a good fit for your personal collection
You have space to keep the book


Reasons to donate or sell a book:

It is old or damaged
You will not read it again
It contains outdated information
You do not have room to keep it
It is a textbook that you will not use again, Bring the books you want to donate to a secondhand store, a local library, a daycare, or a near by school. Contact your local used bookstore to inquire about the books you want to sell.


Alternatively, you could try to sell the books online.
If you donate your books, don’t forget to ask for a receipt to file for a tax deduction.
You may also recycle paperback books.

, Sort the books you want to keep into stacks, piles, or rows that correspond with your organizational method. For example, if you want to alphabetize your books by author’s last name, place all of the “A’s,” “B’s,” “C’s,” etc. into their own pile. If you want to sort the books by genre, create a pile for history, literature, etc., After you have sorted your entire collection once, systematically organize each pile. For example, if you sorted your books by author’s last name, grab the “A” pile and put the stack in alphabetical order. If you separated the books by genre, grab the history pile and organize the books into sub-genres (American History, Women’s history, etc.) or by author’s last name."

Choose a location for your collection.,
Settle on a storage method.,
Stack or shelve your books.,
Make books you use often accessible.,
Box and label excess books you want to keep.,
Protect rare, delicate, or important books.",How to Organize Books4," If you don’t have an office or a study, don’t worry. You don’t need to store all of your books in one room. Feel free to spread your collection throughout your house.


For example, keep all of your cookbooks in the kitchen. , You can display your organized book collection in a variety of ways. You may store your books on shelves or ledges. You can also stack your books in storage cubes.


For a more eclectic look, consider stacking your books on the floor, in a dormant fireplace, or down the edge of your staircase., Once you’ve settled on a location and storage method, you can finally put away your collection. Place the books on your bookshelves or stack the books in a storage cube.


Before you shelve or stack your books, you may want to clean and dust your storage unit.

, For convenience, frequently used books should be readily accessible. This is especially important if children will be using the books.


If children are using the collection, store the books at their level. Instead of a traditional shelf, consider a storage system that would allow them to stack the books. Lastly, you may also want to store the books in the places they will use them the most, such as a playroom or bedroom., If you don’t have the space to display your entire collection, you may need to put some of your books in storage. To protect your books while they’re in boxes, follow these tips:


Stack your books horizontally with the heaviest books on the bottom.
To fill in gaps, insert books vertically. Never place a book spine down.
If possible, try not to stack more than three boxes of books on top of each other., If your collection contains rare books, you may wish to take extra steps to protect these special items. It is good practice to apply all of these suggestions to your entire collection.


Store your rare books out of direct sunlight. In addition to fading the book jacket, the sunlight will slowly deteriorate the book.
Keep your books in their dust jackets.
Before shelving or storing a book, always remove bookmarks and scraps of paper.
Try to store your books at a consistent temperature. Too much humidity will generate mold in your books; too little humidity will leave your books brittle."

Research the artist's output.,
Find out if there are duplicates.,
Pinpoint when in the artist's career the work was completed.,
Ask yourself if the work epitomizes the artist's style.,
Investigate whether the artist is well-known or has a reputation.,
Know that size matters.,
Find out if the piece of art has ever been owned by someone renowned.,
Investigate market demand.,
Look at liquidity.,
Look at market trends.,
Place the art in a primary or secondary market.,
Look at what other, similar pieces of art have sold for.,
Know that one-of-a-kind artworks are difficult to price, and somewhat more subject to change.,
Look at scale, intensity, and medium.",How to Value Your Art," How many works of art did the artist complete? The output of the artist in general greatly affects price. Prolific artists' pieces of work tend to be less valuable than those of artists who simply produced less, all things being equal.;
, Is the work one-of-a-kind? Because of supply and demand, works that are singular are worth more than replicated works. For this reason, a paintings is usually worth more than a print or a lithograph — there are simply fewer of them out on the market.

, Was the work completed early on or toward the twilight of their career? Interestingly enough, works of art completed early in artists' careers are usually valued higher than those completed later on.Why is this? Although it's not true in all cases, early work tends to be more daring, passionate, and unpredictable, sometimes owing to the artist's desire to establish a reputation for him or herself. Many appraisers believe that as an artist becomes more established in their career, their art loses some of its derring-do and boldness. This artistic predictability is sometimes factored into the valuation.

, Works of art that epitomize an artist's aesthetic are usually appraised higher than works of art that are tangential or not representative of the artist's oeuvre.


Pablo Picasso's art is indelibly linked to an artistic movement called cubism. Currently, Picasso's most expensive painting, Le Rêve, which was sold in early 2013 for $155 million, falls firmly in that aesthetic.It is very emblematic of Picasso's style in general.

, Artists generally fall into three categories of renown: well-known, up-and-coming, and unknown. Artists who are well-known and have a rich history of collection can almost always command more value more than artists who are unknown.


How much buzz is the artist attracting? The more mentions they get in significant publications, the better.
Does the artist have any significant showings in galleries, or did they in the past? Has the artist received acclaim from other art institutions, such an prizes, awards, or achievement recognition?
Do any museums own the artist's work? Artists who find homes for their art in museums can expect a significant uptick in the value of their work.

, Generally, bigger works of art are appraised higher than smaller ones, usually because of the degree of difficulty involved., Barring the artist themselves, works of art that were formerly owned by someone famous or well-known can command much higher prices than those pieces who don't ha or condition issues. An item that is ripped, water-damaged, discolored, or otherwise damaged can return significantly less than an item that is in perfect shape.Note that an item that isn't technically damaged but isn't as vibrant as it was when first completed will qualify as having a ""condition issue.""


Cleaning up an artwork or fixing condition issues can have a significant impact on its value. Cleaning up and fixing condition issues on an artwork can improve its bottom line up to 20%.

, In short, how many people want to buy the piece of art? Art is sold in a market. This means that the value of items offered in the market fluctuates depending on how much buyers want the piece, as well as how much they are willing to pay. Ask yourself if the market is in a peak, where demand is usually high, or a trough, where demand is depressed.


If a glut of pieces enter the market, the market price tends to go down; if pieces are sold off or if a new group of buyers suddenly becomes active, the market price tends to go up. This is often referred to as supply and demand.

, Liquidity, also called marketability, is the reliability with which an asset or security can be sold without affecting its asking price.In the art world, high liquidity means that it's relatively easy to sell an item quickly and thus convert its value into cash. Low liquidity means that it's harder to do this, creating a barrier to converting an asset into cash.

, Related to demand, pricing trends are usually the result of changes in people's perceptions of art or changes in their material circumstances.


In the early 2010s, Chinese billionaires, flush with money, began buying Asian art, sending demand significantly higher and signalling a new trend in the market.As a result of this trend, Indian and Asian art became a hot commodity in the art world.Collectors are willing to pay more of a premium for art in this market.

, Has the work of art been sold before? The primary market is what the work of art is valued at when it is first sold. The secondary market is what the work of art is valued at after it has been sold at least once. The secondary market value has a direct relation to what the item was sold for in the primary market.One of the things you want to look out for is a certificate of sale, especially if your item has been purchased at an auction. Referencing this document will make your ultimate appraisal much less subjective.

, If you've just bough an impressionist painting in the vein of a painting that was just sold for $12,000 — all other things being equal — that should give you a good benchmark for what your painting may be worth.


When looking at comparables, use a price range instead of a single price. Art appraisers generally say, for example, that a sculpture is worth in the $800 - $1,200 range instead of saying it's worth $1,000.

, An artwork that is truly unique and doesn't have any other analogues against which to compare it is difficult to value. The appraisal arrived at is considered to be especially volatile.

, Scale is the size of the artwork and the level of detail. Intensity is the level of effort put into the artwork. Medium is the quality of the materials used. Combine these three aspects together and you should have a better idea of what your artwork is worth."

Make sure the title accompanies your artwork.",How to Title Your Work of Art," Brainstorm a list of ideas that reflect what your artwork is about. It can be simple, such as “trees” or “girl,” but it can also be thematic or subconscious, such as “friendship” or “childhood.” Think about what the meaning of the artwork is, and how the title can convey that meaning.;
, What drove you to create this piece of art? Reflect on your feelings about this artwork and what you’d like to share with your audience. How does the artwork make you feel? Identify the story you want to tell.

, With artwork, there are certain areas of the piece that the artist wants the audience to see first or to pay the most attention to. Think about the focal point of your artwork. What do you want people to focus on when they observe your artwork? Naming your artwork after the focal point can help people understand your artwork better.Johannes Vermeer’s “Girl with a Pearl Earring” draws attention to the small jewel in the ear of the subject., Oftentimes, titles help audiences understand what they’re looking at. Titles can give tools to the audience to know how to interpret the piece. What do you want audiences to know about your artwork?Do you want your title to direct the viewer towards a particular interpretation? For example, a work of art of a dog sitting on a beach can be interpreted in a number of ways. But if you title the picture, “Abandoned,” the viewer will assume that the dog has been abandoned on the beach. If you title the picture, “Best Friend,” people will react differently to the dog’s presence.
Some artists prefer not to tell the meaning of their artwork, deliberately leaving the title ambiguous.

, No matter your reasoning for choosing a particular title, make it meaningful for you. You are, after all, the artist, and the artwork is made primarily for yourself. Some artists like to have titles that convey certain meanings so that they remember certain details about the process of making the artwork, what inspired the artwork, and so on.Frida Kahlo titled one painting, “I Belong to My Owner,” during a tumultuous affair with exiled communist Leo Trotsky. The painting of wild flowers in a vase symbolizes her overwhelming love for Trotsky coupled with her need to remove herself from this affair., Using parts of your favorite poem or quote can be an interesting and suitable title for your artwork. Similarly, you could choose a passage from a book. These should not, however, be too lengthy. Choose something that is a short phrase. Also, choose something that adds to the artwork’s meaning, not something completely random that doesn’t mean anything.There shouldn’t be copyright issues with this approach unless you are using a lengthy quote. If you have just a few words from a poem or book and you are appropriating it in a new way, this would likely be protected by fair use guidelines.Pam Farrell titled her painting, “Seasick Sailor,” which were words that she heard in song by both Beck and Bob Dylan.
David White used titles of books and movies such as “The Man Who Knew Too Much” and “The Man Who Would Be King” and repurposed them into titles for a series of paintings. One of his paintings is, “The Man Who Was Tired of Perpetual War,” naming the action after the character in his painting., Talk with family, friends, or other artists to get suggestions on a good title. They may have some interesting or inspirational ideas that you hadn’t thought of.


Alternately, throw a “titling party” with other artists or friends. Throw a party and display the artwork. Ask everyone to give suggestions for a title. Some titling parties demand that all guests stay until suggestions are made and a title is chosen.Painter Jackson Pollock would often only number his paintings, such as “Number 27, 1950,” but the art critic Clement Greenberg would give the paintings poetic names, such as “Lavender Mist” or “Alchemy,” in order to differentiate among them., If your artwork or artistic style is particularly influenced by a certain piece of art or artist, you could consider naming your work after that. Paying homage to your influences can be a good source for artwork titles.


Andy Warhol created a series of pop culture-infused paintings called, “The Last Supper,” as reinterpretations of Leonardo da Vinci’s “The Last Supper.”, Observe how other artists name their works of art. Read the story behind why a particular artwork was given its name. Read titles for different types of artwork, from classical paintings and modern drawings to sculptures and video art.

, Your title might revolve around a particular theme or topic, but you might not like the word choices. Look up key words in a thesaurus to come up with alternate words that mean the same thing., You might have a few key words that describe the theme you want to convey. Adding descriptive words can give more dimension to your title. Think of adjectives or adverbs that might work to enhance your title.


Georgia O'Keeffe titled one painting, ""Calla Lily Turned Away,"" giving more description to the floral subject of her work.Mary Cassatt named one painting, ""Mrs. Duffee Seated on a Striped Sofa, Reading,"" expanding on the most obvious subject to include more details of the painting.

, Switch around the words that you’ve chosen to see how they flow together. Putting the words in a different order can shift the meaning slightly, or it can make it easier to say.


Say the words out loud to hear how they sound together.

, Instead of delving into a complex naming process, consider giving your artwork a very simple title that describes exactly what is in the artwork. This could be something like “Wooden Table with Fruit Bowl,” “Red Ball,” or “Girl Swinging.”


Emily Carr titled many of her paintings simply, such as “Breton Church” and “Big Raven.”Claude Monet’s ""Still Life: Apples and Grapes” is a still life painting of a table with fruit., Key words that reflect the topic or theme of your artwork might resonate better in another language. Choose a few words and try them in another language.


Make sure you spell the words right in the other language. Double check any accents or other required markings for your words. Missing these markings can potentially mean altering the entire meaning of a given word.
Try to find someone who speaks that language. Run your title by them to make sure it doesn’t carry unwanted connotations.

, The goal with titling your artwork is to make sure it stands apart from other works of art. If it has the same name as another piece of artwork – especially something well-known – that can unintentionally link your art to someone else’s, risking confusion, misinterpretation or just basic lack of originality.


Search online for your title and see what you find.

, Your title might mean one thing to you but something entirely different to another person. Getting first reactions and feedback on your title can be a good way to understand how it will be received.


Consider if your title is ambiguous or if it can be interpreted in different ways.

, Unless it’s deliberate, don’t send your artwork out into the world with any misspelled word in the title. Your error can make you look less professional or serious as an artist. Similarly, double check grammar, especially if your title is longer than a phrase., While you might title a piece of art to give it additional meaning, you may also title a piece of art so that you can promote yourself as an artist. Forgo the “Untitled” title, and instead strive to have a distinguishable work of art.This can potentially even add value to your artwork.For paintings in a series, you might name them sequentially (such as “Blue Fence #1,” “Blue Fence #2,” and so on). They may be hard to keep track of, however. Go for different titles and help yourself keep track of individual works.
Reviewers, critics and collectors can reference your work more accurately with a specific title. If you call all your pieces “Untitled,” it will quickly get confusing as to which piece is being referred to.
Having a unique title will make it easier for people searching online for your work to find you., If you plan to circulate your artwork at all, make sure the title of the piece goes with the artwork. Write it on the back of the actual piece of art.If you post your artwork online, make sure your title appears with the artwork.This can improve your online profile by making your artwork easier to find.

If the search results come up with a list of articles, you'll need to compare your topic idea to the articles there to see if any of them meet the requirements for a duplicate title as the one you are proposing and to ensure your topic you began isn't deemed to be something that will one day need to be merged to prevent duplicate information in two different articles according to our Merge Policy.
, Make sure to use the term ""Visit"" as part of the how-to title as written on this site at the very front of the title followed by the theme park name. If the theme park has more than one branch (such as Six Flags and similar), you'll need to add in it's name after the theme park name. If there are still several notable differences of multiple choices, you'll need to finish this title off with ""in"" and the city name in which this theme park itself is based., You'll need to know whether or not the park has several sections (or lands) throughout the park, the park has lands that are untitled but tend to be split into their own groups, or if the park is spread sporadically around a bunch of ungrouped lands focused around one or two soul footpaths with buildings on either side.

If the park has titled lands, you'll more likely to need to use the wikiHow Advanced Editor or Article Creation tool so you can establish the subsections of steps, so that each land can be portrayed accurately, and so that the reader doesn't lose their focus because it looked confusing to read to them. This will be described more in a few steps from here, so be prepared.
If the park has untitled lands, you'll more than likely need to designate some type of system to explain to the reader the direction of travel when the reader would be walking and how they'd come upon it. If the attraction is at the borderline between two untitled lands, you'll need to mention something along the lines of ""If you've reached (attraction name in second title), you've walked too far or reached into the next land"" upon the last attraction in the lands' section.

If you do not like (or do not understand) wiki-text languages, you can use the Article Creation Tool. However, using this will make the flow seem to go awful slow and you'll end up giving up a whole lot sooner.


If the park doesn't have titled lands or has no visible lands but a few soul footpaths, you can use the Guided Editor to begin your article, but you'll still have some work to do to establish a great article otherwise. Guided Editor will help form some of the wiki-text to form the items you talk about into Steps.

For most of these articles, you won't need to add substeps (of your main Steps) and many sub-tips of Tips which some users find difficult to understand the syntax of.



, Although this will depend on how you want to get into the article and how your settings run, most users will want to click the ""Write an Article"" button from any page of wikiHow which will send you to this page where you'll have to input your proposed title. This is a double-check step to ensure none of the top five (5) articles match what the article calls for as a duplicate. Type your title based on our Title Policy and click ""Get Started"" then click the ""None of these are exactly the same as How to (title)"" and click ""Write My Article""., The Article Creation tool, as was stated earlier can help, but you can also send the article to be written in the Advanced Editor from there, or you can deselect this option in the preferences page and write them from Guided Editor and switch between Advanced and Guided on the fly. For those who know front-end wiki syntax very well, you can (and should) use the Advanced editor and go from there, but each article's information will vary widely., The introduction of the article is the first place that will establish the first form of communication to get your reader psyched into visiting the park. However, it isn't there to spoil the user's vacation to the park or describe just what the article is bound to do. Shoot for three to four sentences for an introduction, as part of a paragraph to psych the reader to get them ready to read the remainder of the article., Although park maps will differ, park maps with all rides and attractions should be enough to formulate a good article that is ready to be researched. Experience in the particular park you are planning to write about is definitely a plus, but giving the reader the ability to see just how much there is to do in the park, makes for one excellent article - even if you feel that the ride was rather lame, let the others know that when they arrive at the step that they might want to either not ride or take things in stride or to skip the ride at all. (Even other shows and attractions should be written as their own step.), Anything that makes this attraction unique is a strong point to write down about the attraction and include in the Step inside the article. Either research the ride on Flickr (for static images) or YouTube (most widely-used researching choice for videos) to see just what each ride is like. With so many users on YouTube filming their on-ride POV videos (and even some with off-ride videos), you'll need to know just what the user should expect to encounter on their ride.

Even if you've been to the park before, make sure you see spots where others might have recorded that show things others were thinking to see where your reader might not understand if given the article inside the park. Try to expand on others' mistakes from their filming and explain their wrongdoings.
(Search using the exact ride name along with the theme park's name as well as a trigger word using ""on-ride"" or ""off-ride"" (or sometimes even the trigger abbreviation ""POV"") as these videos can take either of these two forms when searching. If the search returns no results (or few/unrelated results), omit these trigger words altogether and try again. If this still produces none, you'll need to rely on other sources of information such as from this theme parks website which could list information about their rides.

For show attractions however, neither terms ""on-ride/off-ride"" nor ""POV"" are ever used, so do your research without these triggers behind as your search term.



, (i.e. Scrambler rides can be formed into Scramble, as well as shows being either Watch or Take in.). Try not to use the action verbs ""Go"" or ""Ride"" as they can be considered vague and the reader might not be in an understanding with those steps set that way or need to further question what to expect when they get there and will tend to venture away to find more information that you should have researched already. As you work through the park, focus on gathering an action verb to describe what the ride does, what types of scenery it provides and how the two elements interact to provide for a great ride experience and describe. Even if you have never ridden the ride or watched the attraction before, get to know exactly what all attractions are like., Make sure the reader understands some of the other theme park options of nearby theme parks that could be around or within a comfortable (30-90 minute) driving distance or in case they don't want to go to this park once they arrive), as well as noting the address of the park (which you'll need to cite where you reputably obtained the park address/contact info from).

Google has information, but you'll have to really deep-down delve to really understand where it's getting it's information. Bing has it set up so that once asked, the engine will give you your answers then relay you to the website it found the information from then send you to other possible search results if you still didn't find the information you were looking for.

, But, please read on, as it's not all about those few steps to visit the park.

Discuss the parking situation. Although you don't need to grab directions from a nearby landmark like most websites mention (since everyone is coming from different places), you might want to discuss whether the park's parking options include an open lot or some sort of enclosed parking garage. If you can find the parking spot's exact address located online somewhere, provide an address as close as you can to the parking garage as well as it's price for a general 2-to-4 axle car. If you can't, provide it's nearest cross-streets nearest the entrance to the parking area.

Although this should really be written by typing from a real-life perspective of what you'd find (as if you were the reader looking for these answers yourself), if you do enough research on your topic, this will take you a small amount of time - if you know just where to look for your answers.
If you have enough citable information as to the parking lot section names (few theme parks websites and apps list this information), provide these names and cite your source as to where you found these names. Don't just say that you found the list on (name major website here) and send the reader searching for answers or looking to prove your information to be inaccurate - no! - that doesn't tell the reader exactly where this information can be found and will more than likely send your reader looking elsewhere to gather the information they need on another website or competitors website (if one exists).


Explain the entrance, or if the walkway to the entrance has something memorable that all readers will encounter when entering (that sets this park separate from the others), mention it! Again, best done by real-life instances that people know of, but could be done sometimes via looking at YouTube videos and Flickr images. Explain to your reader what the turnstile entrance entails - but not to the point where you'll be describing how the crank get's turned or the direction your entrance card gets you in (readers can already assume how these items work or can ask for help if needed when they arrive to that point). You can explain some of the signage on top of the entrance gates or even the theming of the paint scheme surrounding the turnstiles or similar ticket booths to let them know what they should be looking for to get them in.

, Go the extra mile to get the reader psyched to know just what to expect when they get to the park. Even if the entrance of one ride and another is on opposite sides, as long as you group them together of nearby attractions, you can easily keep your reader thrilled and want to understand the step well enough.

Establish subsections of where the lands begin and end as the reader would walk through them. Set Steps up by themed land as with each land set as it's own subsection of the Steps top-level section of the article; Even if you can't read it or can't understand the best pattern of where the exits and entrances are - at least the readers can get a general idea of where the attractions are for themselves and can easily look to find the exact entrance pattern as they enter the park (of if they still can't find the item's entrance, can ask a nearby employee for help who should be able to give them better directions).
If you have an article that needs to be written that you have subsections for and don't know wiki-formatting all that well, rather write the article as is and leave out the subsection title headers and go back and add the subsections following these guidelines later using Guided or Advanced Editor formatting.
Parks not divided into individual lands can be set up as if the reader walks from one end of the park on one side to the back end of the park then coming back around and back to the main intersection where the turnstiles are.

, For each remaining step that you set up, make sure they have information for each attraction - ride or show - that the park has. Although you want to avoid spoilers as much as genuinely possible, you can mention that there are certain areas that can't be missed and describe areas nearby the area that these rides show that this information could almost spoilers of, so the people don't miss them. Describe the ride or attraction using an action verb at the front. (Remember, some nouns can become verbs, but you'll want to catch yourself from using the better action verbs (by doing researching on the potential verb alone at first) to ensure the word can become a verb on it's own.)

Just because some attractions aren't too famous, doesn't mean that it shouldn't be included. (Outside of food vendors) all attractions should be explained in some respect inside the article. (i.e. In SeaWorld parks, although roller coasters similar to Manta and the like are very popular, there are also rather minor attractions such as dolphin shows and the famous Shamu show along with Otter shows and tanks where different types of fish can be watched by the visitors that most people who write these types of articles often miss that really make the article informative.)
If you still need help describing the attraction, inside some theme parks, you can sometimes find theme-park fanatics who will go out and record rides and post them on YouTube as front-seat/on-ride POV videos (as was described before).

, If the park has any special fireworks or special daytime or nighttime parades, give them details into some of the parks' parades. Provide the location of the entrance point of the park and exit point and general parade route, if you have that information easily accessible.

If you have watched a recent showing of the parade and noticed a really great spot that was never crowded, provide this viewing spot referencing nearby attractions and from what side of the walking path you were on.
Don't concern yourself on special fireworks or activities that only happen on select days. (i.e. While most readers will want information on the fireworks shows at the Disney parks (but these articles have been covered already), once you get into talking about the slight variations of Christmas and Halloween versions of the shows and their tweaks, you'll have lost your audience.)

, At the very least, some great tips that fly well include well-sourced Tips about the date which this particular park opened (Grand Opening). Some of this information can be found and sourced from Wikipedia's information for the park. Other ideas to include can include these ideas.

Tips

When 4-8 year old kids get antsy in this park and it seems like your day is lagging behind, give these kids some options. Even though this park has a few areas where kids can explore and run out all their excitement, this may sometimes not be enough. If you haul around a double-seat stroller, and warnings just don't work, give them time in the stroller. If they don't fit, you'll need to find some other way to draw out their energy. They will thank you for helping them ""take a load off their feet"". These youngsters tend to draw energy out more quickly, and become cranky quicker.
Keep kids (under age 5) on ""leashes"" (arm straps) at all times. Don't allow your kids to remove them at any time. It's hard to see your kids leashed up like a pet, but with the large amounts of guests in the park at any time, security is of utmost importance, and their leashes will help immensely. Don't even remove them, when your kids are in their stroller, as it can take only a few seconds for the kid to get out and become missing (the leashes only would allow the child to go so far as you'd allow them to go).


Warnings

Always ride the ride with safety in mind. Use all safety devices the ride operator provided for you and your family.
Rides occasionally close and change at this park. Don't fear if your favorite ride has changed or has become defunct. Something will be there to replace it over time. Their replacements might be just as good as the ride you once loved.
Everybody's tastes are different. You can skip some rides if you don't have time or if the kids act up. Some kids might be too churlish to some rides, while other rides might be too intense for the younger crowd, so you may want to skip these rides.



, Although all Disneyland and Disney World (USA)-based park Visit guides here have already been started as well as a few of the other named parks, categorize most of the Visit articles in Category:Carnivals Circuses and Theme Parks via either of these methods (dependant on your wiki-editor you are using). If you are using the Article Creation Tool, you will have to publish without a category and add it using the Guided Editor that is just as easy to use as the Article Creation Tool when editing an article; and which you'll find towards the bottom of the tool., Turn on the ""Sources and Citations"" section (for those who have had to cite their sources) in Guided Editor (check the ""Sources and Citations"" section towards the bottom of the page and publish) or if you are able to use the Advanced Editor, set up the ""Sources and Citations"" section and place the {{reflist}} template on the article in this section. If you are working from the Article Creation Tool, you must skip this and add this step's publication information manually from the Guided or Advanced Editors. Not doing so at any point of citing, will create cite (citation) errors which cause reader confusion.

If you have other research/reference sources that are citable based on wikiHow's External Links policy, provide those in this section as well. Forego any eHow or About.com links as these are competitors websites which have been known to be from farm systems that can sometimes be unsuitable to be referenced on articles here due to those editors being paid to write their articles which can sometimes cause major gaps or inaccuracies
Don't just say that the information is from a ""personal experience""! If there was a webpage that gave you the idea to create it (besides this article) and this link doesn't violate this policy, provide it in this section with the notable words ""ideas from"" provided in the same line along with the website that gave you the ideas. (i.e. ""* ideas from (link URL here) "")

, If you are using the Article Creation tool, you won't have this feature, however, once you publish and use the Guided or Advanced Editor, you can add Step-by-Step pictures in the article.

The Flickr tab in the Guided or Advanced Editor can be a lifesaver for most of people when they are in trouble, it can sometimes run you into trouble if the theme park isn't well-known or well photographed (such as theme parks outside of the United States/Canada and some theme parks in Europe). Flickr tends to see people photographing rides from the outside (and sometimes inside) of famous (or can become famous later) rides. Include photos that have the main entrance (or close to main entrance) as the photo you'll use, but make sure the photo is specific to that specific park's entrance.
Use the Local file tab to use pictures you yourself took of the ride. Click the ""Add Image to Steps"" button in Guided Editor or by clicking the add pictures button (which looks like a portrait of a mountain with a plus sign in the right hand corner of the portrait) on the tiny toolbar of icons at the top of the Advanced Editor (if you've chosen to utilize it for subsections) and utilizing the pictures under the ""Flickr"" tab and add the photo that way.

, Although the Article Creation tool won't give you a place to explain what you are doing (and will automatically populate a field inside of the edits that need to be patrolled with this information), with the Guided and Advanced Editors, you'll need to add in an edit summary such as ""created new article"" or similar. Sometimes there will be another box that will help you populate these fields once you begin typing, but this helper object won't display unless you create them in the Guided Editor., Scroll down the page until you see the line of buttons and click the Publish button. It may take a few extra seconds for the article to compile and ask if you like what you see, but you can easily select Publish if you have all the necessary things this article has described here. If you aren't done with the initial publishing edit during this session, you can click the ""Save draft"" button."

Prepare yourself in advance.,
Pick out the ride you want to go on.,
Get in the line.,
Stand in the line.,
Relax while you wait.",How to Wait in Line for an Amusement Park Ride," If you already know you're going to a theme park that is known to have long lines, or if you're going there during the peak season (school breaks, summer, etc.), then you should prepare yourself by bringing things for the wait such as a book, mp3 player, magazine, cell phone, etc.

, You may see a roller-coaster from a distance that you may think you really want to go on, but you should really get closer to it and take a look at the rules and what it is about. Choose carefully, because you might regret waiting a long time for a ride you found boring.

In outdoor rides, if you are unsure whether you should ride the ride, watch it go a couple times. While the entire ride may not be visible to you, parts of it will most likely be. This will aid you in your decision.






, Before you get in the line, take a look at the wait time sign if they have one, and ask yourself ""Is it really worth the wait?"" If it is, go ahead and go in the line. If not, leave and find other ride that suits your interests.

The amount of time you should wait for a ride really depends on you and anyone else in your group. If you have people with you that you know simply cannot stand waiting, then if the wait seems a bit long, it may be best to skip the ride and come back to it later.






, If the sun is blazing, do your best to cover your head. This is because if you're way to hot, you're more likely to realize if the line is moving slowly or not. Your best bet is to check the weather before you leave. If you see it's going to be 100 degrees, then dress lightly and bring a hat. If it's going to rain, bring an umbrella. Weather may not always be correct, but it is better to be safe than sorry.

, If you're over-excited about the ride and want the line to move faster, slip on your headphones and listen to either a slow song, or one of your favorites. Doing this will likely distract you in a good way, because you'll be hearing music instead of focusing on all the people in the line.

, Try previewing each ride on YouTube, or take a peak at the ride through photos from others. Learn from what others see. Although some of the bigger rides have on-ride footage, there may be a few short snippets of others that exist that may just give you enough of a glimpse of the attraction (more-so plays as the entertainment option than the rides that this happens for). This can help decide which rides and attractions will take priority during your visit.

,, You are usually allowed in through the barriers before opening, however you won't have access to most rides. Getting through the barriers early will give you time to pick up a park map and plan your route to the first ride of the day.

",How to Visit Sesame Place2," With the availability of the whole city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and the historic importance of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania a few hours away (2 to 3 hours away, but still drivable), there are a wealth of other options you can attend.

, The address to the Sesame Place is located at 100 Sesame Road, Langhorne, PA 19047 .The cost to park your car at the Sesame Place resort will run you about $17 for cars and upwards from there (depending on complexity of vehicle)..

, The entry plaza has a big ""Sesame Place"" logo (with Big Bird's face above it)emblazoned on it!

, This park is shaped in the form of a U (containing most of the games and attractions) but also contains a long street down the center that most guests conglomerate on.

, Except for a nice gathering place for characters to meet their fans towards the end of the street furthest inside the park, this has few to no actual attractions that need to be watched/ridden. (Most of the walkway around the U-shaped portion of the park (containing the park attractions) is a one-way so you must be willing to enter one area and walk around while all walking the same direction.)

Ride Vapor Trail, Sesame Place's only roller coaster.,
Take a walk down the center corridor if you haven't before.",How to Visit Sesame Place3," This silly one-person car goes around a guided track using arm-power. Using a row-like motion in front of the child, this fun little ride is definitely something to get the children motivated for the rest of the park. However, some of the cars need a little grease on it's track, as is apparent by the squeakiness of most of the cars when the child powers the car. The child may become confused later on in this ride and the length is quite large and long for it's current theming.

, Although it's got a neat and interesting-looking name, there's nothing real special about this area other than that's it a slide like most found at most elementary school playgrounds nationwide with a yellow theme.

, In 2015, this area started with a Halloween maze (utilizing a story-like read on attraction barricades featuring the Sesame Street characters. Something or someone is missing in the Sesame Street group you read to find what it is they are missing and also where it can be found and where it ended up at the end.

, This is seasonal, and during the summer months include the water attractions. The walking tracks area eventually come back out to the area where you started allowing you to continue walking around the path. In 2015, this area includes the ""Not So Spooky Hayride"" that takes guests around a track on a slow-moving journey into ""The Count's"" world.

,

,,, Although this ride doesn't go very high or very fast, it can give your children their very first drop-ride experience. With a warning that it's about to launch you up, it will seconds before drop you down again and then gradually build you up and drop-you back down again until it doesn't drop you very far. This ride will generally take about 5 minutes, but can be shorter due to other line lengths of waiting riders. Adults are permitted on this ride and actually are encouraged to ride (even if they have no other children in tow.)

, Styled after the Dumbo rides at the Disney parks, this ride will have you flying around in fish-like vehicles. Press the red button in the front seat to move you up and down in the fish for several minutes worth of flying fun. It takes several moments for the fish to get up in the air from the beginning, so keep the button pushed in if you'd like to get raised from the beginning. Depress the button later, if you'd like to decrease your height. All riders will later be decreased to the standing point on the ground for a later debunking.

,, Themed on the Sesame Street characters, this Carousel will have you wishing you could spend every day with the characters.

, Although some children are afraid of a ride that swings as quickly as this one, this one can please some of it's riders on a daily basis and some actually come out liking the ride towards the end.

, Other than having your kids be able to race each other on double-slides, it's got little to no attractable value anymore.

, Most viewers want tea-cup rides in parks, and here's this one in Sesame Place that's fun for all ages alike.

, Much like olden days curve rides on some midways, this ride takes Oscar's best ideas and reaches out to show it's guests his idea of things and pokes fun into every rider.

, This ride is much like The Flying Fish nearby but with theming towards blue, furry Cookie Monster, in yellow ""Ahoy Matey""-like ships.

, This is one of the few places where you can actively let your kids roam free and play, but do keep an eye on them.

, Similar to some ""Scrambler-like"" rides, this ride will give you that same thrill. This ride might not be suitable for all ages, though some ages are more easily enthused into riding it.

, Although styled in the manner of the tea cups ride, when you couple those types of rides with the ride soaring you a few yards above the top of people heads-high, spin your cookie jar vehicle around as fast or as slow as you want and you'll have some fun on this ride.

, Although this roller coaster is short and features no ""flying and high-intensity features most roller coasters do, if you are thinking there's nothing in it for you, you must be kidding yourself. It is pure fun and could potentially be a child's first roller coaster experience (that's more for later elementary school and tweens than for early elementary school and younger children). Like the Elmo says ""Wave to your mommy!"" at the top of the first lift hill.

, Meet with friends near the ""Sesame Neighborhood"".

","How to Visit Rainbow's End in Auckland, New Zealand"," Like many theme parks, Rainbow's End is busy during the school holidays. Christmas Day is the one day the park is closed but you can expect it to be busy throughout the summer months. Located at 2 Clist Crescent, Manukau, Auckland, some of the park's attractions are weather dependent so if you want to visit in July or August, remember some rides may not be running due to snow, rain or high winds. The park is open from 10:00am to 5:00pm daily.;
, The rides and are within the park as a whole or in Kidz Kingdom.

, Events occur frequently, if not regularly. Matariki is recognised, sometimes with celebratory family tickets.

, You'll enjoy your day more if you don't feel like you've missed out. If you're keen to go on rides that don't have lots of seats, like the karts and the log flume, get to those early in the day and work your way toward the rides with more capacity such as Invader or Stratosfear.

, Publicised as the park's scariest ride it is 30 metres high at the highest point, has a 360 degree swing angle and will get the blood rushing to your head as you spin upside down with your fellow 29 riders.

, This ride is a combination of a roundabout, and roller coaster! You'll spin around whilst travelling along a 80 metre track at up to 70 km/h (43.5 mph).

, At 18 stories to the top, you will have plenty of time to think about how there’s only one way down! You may of seen this ride on the popular comedy show Jono and Ben. They often attempt to interview celebrities, with varying success, on this ride.

, 18 metres high with three types of rotation, this will put you in a spin. Pick your partner carefully as you'll be sitting side by side, isolated from the other 22 riders.

, Try the Corkscrew Roller coaster. At a maximum of 45 kilometres per hour you'll drop, loop and go thorough not one but two corkscrews]]

, At Rainbow's End these are:
Log Flume
Gold Rush Roller Coaster Ride
Pirate Ship
Dodgems
Scorpion Cars (Go karts)

,, There's Comfy Land and Tiny Tots for those who like to just play not ride and check out the Dixie Chickens Show if you just want to relax and watch something for a while.

, Factor in transport costs, eating at the park, purchasing souvenirs and accommodation if you don't live nearby or need to travel home more than a few hours.

, Check the website for family and group deals. Often, you can save money not paying for tickets at the gate and you will save buying online.

, Remember branded food, packets of chips for example, are not permitted, unless they are for park guests with special dietary requirements. Make your own sandwiches, pies, sausage rolls etc or take your favourite brands out of the original packaging.

Ride the Loch Ness Monster.",How to Visit Busch Gardens Williamsburg," This will save you time when you arrive at the park - you won't have to wait in any queues at the ticket offices!;
, Try previewing each attraction (ride or show) on YouTube, or take a peek at the ride through photos from others. Learn from what others see. This can help decide which rides and attractions will take priority during your visit or which attractions you'll feel you or your family will want to miss.



Busch Gardens doesn't allow video taping on any ride without prior approval by park staff. Ask them for permission, they potentially will. For most rides on YouTube, you'll need to include a true statement that says that you received permission before riding - as anything that doesn't will get taken down if found by Busch Gardens staff. This is to ward off those who post their journey for others so others don't have to ride if they don't want to; they want these videos to be only a preview of the park's attractions and nothing more.

,, Discuss some of your other options that exist for the other nearby area including Colonial Williamsburg and the Navy base in the nearby city of Newport News(and Hampton Roads), Virginia and the many options in Virginia Beach such as aquariums and other relaxation areas on the beach., The address to Busch Gardens Williamsburg is 1 Busch Gardens Blvd, Williamsburg, VA 23185 The cost to park at this park's parking lot is $15 per day, though there are multi-day options for $25 instead if purchased at once., Walk up the path that leads from the parking lot to the park entrance gate. Busch Gardens Williamsburg only has one gate near the England land in the park. Along the path, you'll see other houses for rental equipment (such as toddler strollers, wheelchairs, and the like) and even a few guest relations counters that can help give you information about the park, along with several service counters that can help steer you in the right direction during the day.


Stop by the sign outside the gate along the path that says ""Welcome to Busch Gardens Williamsburg"". This is a highly-photographed spot by visitors who think this is the best thing in or around the park (is that they actually got to this spot).

, This park is divided into about ten different lands themed onto European-named countries . These lands include England, Italy, Festa Italia, Oktoberfest and nearby Germany, New France, Ireland, Scotland and Jack Hanna's Wild Reserve., These will be discussed in a few moments., The slow-moving bucket-styled skyride will take you to three stations set apart in a triangular path at both France and Germany and then back to England. However, at each leg of the journey you must debunk your bucket and reboard if you are continuing on to each of the other locations on the Skyride route.


Sometimes you'll hear this station's Skyride building referred to as the Aeronaut Skyride station. Don't worry; although it's not marked on the station entrance, some visitors still use it's much older name to designate this Skyride building instead.

, Although this station is called the Tweedside train station in the English portion of the park, it also travels to the Festa train station in Festa Italia, and also towards the Caribou train station in New France.


At times, you'll pass by some of the more famous rides such as the Loch Ness Monster roller coaster and even past Escape from Pompeii, along with many others along the route. At one point, you'll even go by an intersection, where the train waltzes past a route that walkers can take, which is guarded by a railroad/transportation gate/latch bar like that of a gate of a crossing near a automobile-car transportation stop area, and is controlled by a ""traffic light"".

, Although much similar to Universal Studios' Jurassic Park ride and along with SeaWorld's Journey to Atlantis, this extreme log flume is just as extreme and has a surprise at the end that will indeed get you soaked.

, With various options themed to those furry Muppets from Sesame Street, there's something every child can partake in, in this area of the park. This area features a flat flume ride called the Bert and Ernie's Loch Adventure, a rocking pirate ship ride called Oscar's Whirly Worms, a family-friendly drop tower ride called ""Prince Elmo's Spire"" and a kid-friendly roller coaster called Grover's Alpine Express., You may also go overtop of the train tracks with the trestle bridge that leads you to Festa Italia for a few more choices (this will be discussed later in this article).

, This one will have your heart pounding for about three to four minutes.

, However, note that this ride's official ride time is far too short for most, lasting on average all of about less than two minutes long., This ride is actually rather stomach-churning and worth the wait in line to ride.,,, Although this ride isn't as bad as many other rapid rafting rides in the United States, this is one ride that (rather mean for the area on which it is stationed) shouldn't be missed. You can find this ride to the opposite side of Apollo's Chariot way past the Turkish Delight attraction and even past the Festa Train Station in this area (it is next to Rapids Gifts).

, This ride is closer to the entrance of Festa Italia than Apollo's Chariot once was. Watch for the blue-colored track. If you don't visit any other roller coaster and love roller coasters, this is one that can't be missed on any Busch Gardens Williamsburg visit.

, Find the purple-colored track roller coaster in back of Tempesto along a separate path in the Festa Italia area of the park. However, take note that this ride is older than Tempesto, so it's mechanics are based on older-styled mechanics. Apollo's Chariot was one of the major highlights of a Busch Gardens trip in the 1990s, but has become a little less popular now with Tempesto nearby.

,,, With some of the ride being indoors and covered and some of it being in a steep decline outdoors, this one is rather scary but if you are in for extreme thrills, you'll definitely love this one. If you are planning to ride, take a longer look at the interior ride queue - this is one queue that is not to be missed.

, They also have a junior bumper cars ride that is meant for smaller children who can't quite reach the peddles yet, but understand that this ride is fun., Much like the bumper cars, this also has a younger generation ride of the same type that they call ""Wirbelwindchen.
, The building is also air conditioned, so this is the perfect place to go and sit down if it is a hot day outside.


Das Festhaus is the one and only place in Busch Gardens Williamsburg where beer is served, but you don't have to get beer if you don't want it.
Although there is no stop of the train in this area, you can literally see this building from the train ride around the park.
At various times throughout the day, there is a German themed show that is performed here. So if you're hungry, and want to take a break or enjoy a show, check the board outside for show times, and enjoy your meal during that time period.

, Although the ride is slow, it's inside is very dark and intense for those who can't stand the darkness and loud and unappealing sound effects for many who dare enter. And to add to that, this ride features 3D graphics that make this ride rather scary for most who visit. But it does have some great taste to those who can stomach all the previous information.

, However, note that this ride is a carousel ride with some German theming.,, Although slow and steady ""wins the race"", this attraction isn't very handicapped accessible - it has several stairs, that - though wide - have no other way to get down to the boats without wheeling down (bumpety bumpety bump!); they have no elevator down nor are there any escalators either and the only way down is to push the chair or handicap furniture down these stairs stair-by-stair.

, Not only does it have rope bridges to climb across and lots of other neat children's energy play areas, it'll drain your kids of their extra energy that might become built up in the remainder of the park.

This area includes a dragon-egg cart Ferris wheel called the Eggery Deggery, a flying dragon ride called Flutter Splutter, a kid-themed boat ride called Chug-a-Tug, a family-friendly music express ride called Bug-a-Dug, a treehouse, and a water play area called ""Brook""., Although on Alpengeist you don't have a foot plate under your feet when you ride, the few helixes you take in on this ride, make this ride one that is not to be beat if you love roller coasters.

,, Look for the Caribou train station in the back of the New France area.,, This show is only performing until September 4th, so be sure to check it out before then if you're there.

, This very long, dive-roller coaster is rather new but very intense. Most people come out saying this roller coaster is amazing or stunning all in itself.

,, Watch the birds and take a few moments out to cool off from some of the intense rides you've visited today.

, Catch a one-on-one question and answer session at the gate with a trainer.

, Remember that the Bald Eagle is the United States national symbol, and so it's nice to see these birds in a habit close to their own without them wandering too far away from being seen.

, Although it's nothing but a stage play, this is a great theater to rest tired feet after a long day of walking and riding other rides and attractions in this park. You aren't too far from the entrance exit, but you're not can't possibly be quite finished just yet., Styled after the attraction Soarin' at Walt Disney World and Soarin' Over California at Disneyland, this attraction is one not to be missed. However, they do warn that some people may want to miss this attraction who've had certain ailments such as recent pregnancies and surgeries and a few other reasons.,, You have to save the best and oldest remaining ride for last, but be careful if you don't like roller coasters that take you to unknown places in the dark (at one point but for several minutes). The Loch Ness Monster is Busch Garden's oldest steel roller coaster that is still in operation today, and is also the only remaining ride in the Scotland area of the park..

Settle on a time to meet.,
Decide how often to meet.,
Choose the right atmosphere.,
Offer snacks.,
Keep things casual, but maintain a few rules.,
Give your members an idea of how long the meetings should last.,
Consider scheduling in a bit of extra time for socializing.",How to Start a Women's Book Club1," As a general rule, weeknights are better than weekends. Narrowing down the best possible time can be a challenge in itself, though.


A meeting that starts at 7:00 to 7:30 PM gives your members just enough time to eat dinner with their families and may make it possible for them to get back home before bedtime if they have children.
Meetings can start anytime between 6:30 PM and 8:00 PM if your target membership consists of single women or women without children.
If you want members who are stay-at-home moms, you can also meet during the late morning or early afternoon when kids are at school. Think of a meeting that starts sometime between 10:00 AM and 1:00 PM.;
, Most book clubs meet about once per month, since a monthly meeting gives each member ample time to read each book. If you want your book club to be a little closer knit, you can also meet on a weekly or bi-weekly basis to discuss each book as you read it. Setting up checkpoints, such as having the first half of the book read within two weeks, can help keep members at the same pace.


If you do opt to meet on a monthly basis, you can stay in touch in between meetings via e-mail. Staying in touch with one another can be just as effective at building a stronger connection amongst your members as meeting in person each week.

, Many women’s book clubs are meant to be a little personal, so meeting in one another’s homes can work wonderfully. If you or your members feel uncomfortable with this idea, you can opt to meet at a coffee shop or library.


Take turns hosting. If you do meet at one another’s homes, ask each member who feels comfortable or who has the space to hold a few meetings in her home. This prevents the stress from resting squarely on the shoulders of one or two people.

, Whether buying bottled water and commercially packaged cookies or baking a fancy layer cake and brewing homemade iced tea, refreshments are a good way to get people to relax and open up. The snacks can be as elaborate or simple as you’d prefer, and you can also ask other members to contribute once your group gets established.

, A women’s book club is a good way to make new friends, but if you keep the structure too loose, your club may lose its purpose. Make it a rule that each member must read the book before coming to club. You should also have some rule or guideline about how often each member must show up, and you should strongly encourage members to let you or someone else know when they cannot come.

, The modern woman is a busy person, and knowing just how long a meeting will last can go a long way in encouraging her to come in the first place. Many book clubs meet for about 60 minutes, but you can trim that down to 30 minutes if your members are exceptionally busy or if you meet on a weekly or bi-weekly basis.

, As your club members get closer, the temptation to talk about off-topic matters will almost certainly increase. You may want to schedule an extra 15 to 30 minutes before or after official book club business for members to chat and socialize about non-club matters.

Don’t try to reinvent the wheel.,

Start with what you know.,
Offer more to your readers than a book discussion.,
Keep it fresh.,
Market your new online group.,
Make people feel welcome.",How to Start an Online Book Group," Before you even think about the first book you want to offer for discussion, take some time to peruse existing online book clubs and check out what kind of software they are using. You don’t have to be a software engineer in order to create a website.;
, You might want to use a message board system, an email system or a blog. There are advantages and disadvantage to each option, and your choice should reflect the amount of time you have to devote to interaction. Again, look at a variety of online book club websites and think about which type of discussion forum appeals to you.

, Like it or not, first impressions still count. People see the graphics before they start to read the content. Experiment with colors and different fonts. Ask your family and close friends to look at your website, and ask them to navigate through it before it goes live. Listen to the feedback and work on making your online book group site an enticing stop for book lovers.

, Make your first book choice one that you are passionate about. Be prepared to keep the discussion going. If you can’t think of a list of questions, check out some reading group guides on the Internet. Here are some standard discussion questions you might want to use:


What do you think of the book’s title? How deep into the book did you get before you understood the relevance of the title? Did the title reflect the main themes of the book?
What are the key characteristics of the protagonist? How did the personality and life experience of the protagonist shape the direction of the novel?
Did the action in the novel parallel important events in history?
Did reading the book evoke any strong emotion in you? Did you cry? Did you laugh? Why? Was there one event in the novel that resonated with you deeply?

, Do some research on the author or the setting in the book. Add links to book reviews, positive and negative, and ask your members to comment on those reviews.

, It takes time to build up a membership, and your members will grow if you keep the content fresh and interesting. Keep all discussions active. Ideally, you will want to check in with your website multiple times during each day. Always provide new information so that your site doesn’t appear to be stagnant.

, Ask your family and friends to drop in and join in the discussion. Invite all your Facebook friends and all of your email contacts. Print your own business cards with the name of your website; ask the local book stores, coffee shops and libraries if you may leave your cards there.

, You can do this by following up on every comment so that your visitors don’t feel like they are being ignored. It’s up to you to keep the conversation flowing.

Start small.,
Ask friends and relatives.,
Move on to acquaintances.,
Advertise with caution.",How to Start a Women's Book Club2," A group of five to eight members can be cozy and may offer a diverse enough range of ideas to get things going. As your club gains momentum, you can consider picking up a few extra members—as long as your meeting space permits it, of course. You generally do not want to exceed 12 to 15 members, however, since larger numbers make it harder for everyone to speak.

, Start with the women, especially those who you know love to read. If you cannot find enough women to join among your loved ones, you can ask the men in your life to pass word of your book club onto other women they know.

, Women who you have a working relationship with or neighbors who you know but rarely speak to are good places to start. You can also extend the invitation to women you see all the time, like your favorite coffee shop clerk, as long as they are familiar enough with you to know your name and face.

, You can hang flyers up at the local library or post an ad in your city’s newspaper, but you may not want to accept anyone and everyone who contacts you for further information. Make sure that each woman who calls is really serious about attending, and ask a few questions over the phone to get to know her a bit before inviting her over to your house for the first meeting.


If you invite too many women who you do not know, you may want to consider holding the first meeting in a public place.

Allow other members to make suggestions.,
Come with discussion questions.,
Ask the other members to come with questions.,
Nudge the group back on track if the discussion gets derailed.",How to Start a Women's Book Club3," Both historical and contemporary issues are up for grabs. Just remember that not every woman will share the same opinion, especially concerning contemporary, political issues. Keep an open mind and use the experience to learn from each other rather than arguing.

, Women are generally more avid readers than men, so plenty of modern books follow the lives of savvy businesswomen or strong mothers. Fill your book roster with these books to inspire and encourage your members.

, You can choose historically significant writers, like Jane Austen or the Brontë sisters, or contemporary authors like P. D. James or Nora Roberts. You can also mix and match, and spend time comparing the ways that female writers of the past wrote versus female writers of the present.

, While your book club is just starting up, you may need to take the initiative and decide the first few books. If there are any you have in mind that might be a good fit for your women’s book club, add them to the list. Otherwise, you can look up a few bestseller lists to get ideas.

, After your club establishes itself, the other member will probably appreciate having the chance to offer their own input about the book selection. You can have each woman take turns choosing a book.


Alternatively, you could also have each member bring up a possible title whenever she thinks of one and have the book voted on as a group before adding it to the roster.

, As the founder of the group, you may need to kick off each meeting by getting the discussion going. Ask questions that invite the other members to analyze themes, characters, or implications. Stay away from questions that can be answered by sharing one’s unfounded opinion or by stating a simple “yes” or “no.”

, If each member comes to the meeting with a question or unique insight, a broader range of perspectives can be covered. The conversation will last longer and be twice as thought-provoking.

, If your members stray too far away from discussing the book and start talking about other matters, politely step in and ask a question to get the conversation back to the book.

Figure out where to meet.,
Set a meeting time.,
Determine how often to gather.,
Set a few ground rules to get running.,
Be prepared to lead.",How to Start an African American Book Club1," The meeting place you choose will determine the tone and size of your group. If you plan on keeping it in your home, or among the homes of your members, you should try to keep it a more intimate group consisting of no more than eight people. If you decide to use public space, like a library or a restaurant with a meeting room, you can open membership up to 12 or more members., The meeting time may need to be altered depending on what is most convenient for your members, but having a meeting time pre-determined can give prospective members an idea of whether or not they can fit the club into their schedules. Meeting at night will open up club membership to working parents. Weekends are generally out, though, since most people prefer to have weekends to themselves. If you do choose a weekend day, opt for Sunday over Saturday.

, Giving your members a month to read a book makes it easier for busy members to finish the reading, but if you do not mind meeting to talk about the book as you read it, you could try meeting every week or every other week. Just realize that busier members may not be able to make a weekly meeting.


Make sure to meet at roughly the same time each week or month. For instance, if you only meet once a month, you could hold your meetings on the second Thursday of every month. If you meet twice a month, you could choose the first and third Tuesday of every month. This consistency makes it easier for members to plan around the meeting.

, You do not need anything too elaborate or strict. You should consider setting rules about how many meetings members can miss or how often members can show up to meetings without doing the reading first. Exceptions can always be made, of course, but having ground rules will help your members treat the club seriously.

, As the founder of the book club, it will likely fall to you to moderate discussions. Make sure that the members stay on track and that conversation does not stray too far from topic. Also be prepared to ask insightful questions to spur discussion.

Ask the people you know.,
Post messages around town.,
Put in a request with the venue.,
Talk to other book clubs.",How to Sustain Book Club Membership1," Many friends gravitate toward one another due to shared interests, making your circle of friends an ideal place to start. Friends, family, and acquaintances are all up for grabs, though. You should only ask people who you think might be interested in joining for the sake of being part of a book club, rather than those who may agree to join just to please you. Otherwise, the likelihood of you being able to keep them committed will not be as high.


You can also ask the people you know to spread the word. Your Great Aunt Sally may not be interested in joining, but her best friend’s niece might be. Mentioning your book club to non-interested parties and asking them to pass the word along is a simple way to advertise to people you do not know.;
, Look for community bulletin boards located in churches, libraries, or gyms. Similarly, if your office has a bulletin board, feel free to post an advertisement for your book club there—as long as doing so does not violate office policy, of course.


You could also try posting an invite to boards online, but you will need to find a website that tailors to your local community. A message board for your community will work, as will a free online classifieds service.

, If your book club meets a library or book store, ask the venue for help recruiting new members. A librarian or book store manager is likely to know many people who love books. If the person in charge has already allowed your book club to meet there, that person may also be willing to help you find interested members.

, Book clubs are not necessarily competitive about membership. A book club that has grown too large for itself might be willing to give you the contact information for anyone who they needed to turn away due to size constraints. Additionally, another book club may have a few members that might be interested in joining your club in addition to their original club if the focus is different.

Determine how exclusive membership should be.,
Ask yourself if you want to limit membership on gender.,
Figure out how many members you want.,
Alert your family, friends, and acquaintances.Even if no one you know wants to join your book club, someone may know someone who would.,
Advertise your new book club.",How to Start an African American Book Club2," As an African American book club, you have the option of limiting membership to African Americans or opening it to anyone who is interested in studying African American literature. Limiting membership may make everyone feel more comfortable and open about their remarks, but opening membership can ultimately provide a greater number of different perspectives.

, Having a mixed-sex book club can lead to more interesting discussions, but limiting the membership by male or female can make your members feel more comfortable and may make it easier to choose books that appeal to the entire group.


Even if you do not put a limit on the gender, book clubs tend to be predominantly composed of females, so you may find yourself being part of an all-female book club without intending to be.

, A group that is too small will not be very lively, but a group that is too large may make it impossible for everyone who wants to speak to get a chance to do so. Typically, book clubs have between 5 and 15 members. Smaller groups have a more personal feeling to them, but larger groups invite a greater diversity in opinion.

, The more people you talk to about your book club, the greater your odds of spreading the word around your community are.

, Ask your library, church, or local community center if you can post a flyer on their bulletin board. You can also post an ad on a free online classifieds for your city or community. In your advertisements, specify that you are starting an African American book club and provide an email address or phone number for interested parties to contact you at.

Contact online African American book clubs for suggestions.There are several notable online African American book clubs.",How to Start an African American Book Club3," African American literature is a broad category. Determine if you are want to cover fiction books, non-fiction books, or both. For fiction books, ask yourself if there are certain genres you want to cover or if any genre is fine. Similarly, for non-fiction books, ask yourself if there are specific categories or topics that you want to include on your book list.

, If you want to start an African American book club that promotes books written by African Americans, you can have a light-hearted tone and compile a list of contemporary novels. On the other hand, if you want to use the club to take a serious look at issues affecting African Americans of both the past and present, the books you choose should be more literary, inspiration, or serious in tone.


If opting for a book club that focuses on African American issues, you may also want to consider whether or not your club should only read books written by African Americans. Authors of other races have also written books dealing with African American issues, and these can be especially useful if you are interested in gauging perspectives of the past.

,, You might be able to contact the person running one of these clubs and ask him or her for book recommendations. If you explain that you are setting up an African American book club in your community, the online club might be more accommodating and helpful.

Keep the discussions lively.,
Maintain a comfortable atmosphere.,
Let everyone have their say.Within any group of people, you will find talkers and listeners.,
Make sure to read books that people want.,
Set some rules about attendance.,
Bribe members with food.Simple refreshments, like coffee and cookies, can work for nearly any meeting.,
Meet for a related event.,
Keep everyone in the loop.",How to Sustain Book Club Membership2," One of the fastest ways to lose interest is to have meeting after meeting of awkward silence. People come to a book club to talk about books, and if the talking stops, so does the coming. Come to each meeting with a list of open-ended questions to ask about each book.


If you are the facilitator of the group, it is your responsibility to keep things on track when people start to get quiet or begin talking about too many off-topic matters. If you are only an ordinary member, you hold just as much responsibility as anyone else to speak up. Anyone interested in generating further interest among the members of a book club must first go the extra length to show his or her own intense interest.

, A book club is nothing more than a social group that meets for a specific purpose. A good book club needs structure, but if you have too much structure, members may start to feel uncomfortable. A simple way to nurture a comfortable environment is to show interest in the other members. A simple greeting of ""It's good to see you"" can go a long way in making someone feel welcome.

, That does not mean that the listeners have nothing of their own to add, though. Pay close attention to the group’s dynamics. If one or two people seem to control the entire conversation while someone else keeps getting interrupted, politely stop the talkers and casually ask for the oppressed listener’s thoughts.


Another important thing to remember is that everyone’s opinion should be treated with respect. You may not agree with an interpretation that one of your club’s members brings up, but that is no reason for you or any other club member to be offensive. Club members should discuss their different opinions civilly and be stopped once the conversation starts turning nasty.

, Instead of letting one person have complete control over the reading list, your club's membership will thrive longer if more people have a say. You can either take turns picking books or have the members vote on options brought up by everyone. Whatever you choose to do, make sure that all the members feel as though their likes and dislikes are being addressed.

, Book clubs only work if the members are willing to show up. Everyone will inevitably miss a meeting here or there, but if someone consistently demonstrates a lack of interest by never showing up, it can be discouraging to the other members. It is better to cut that person loose and find a new member.


Forbidding members from attending if they are not up-to-date in their reading may turn some people away. On the other hand, being too lax about the reading requirement can lead to a room of people who have yet to make it past chapter five in the same book for the last three months. Have a reading requirement, but enforce it loosely enough to keep people comfortable.

, You could also try enhancing the reading by making a related food selection. For instance, if a character talks about a certain dish in the book, try preparing that dish to bring to the club. Similarly, if your club is reading an 18th century British classic, consider a snack that calls that era to mind.

, Field trips and other fun events help the members bond as a group and may increase each member's sense of attachment or belonging.


If the book your club is reading was ever made into a film adaptation, meet separately one night for a showing of the movie.
Invite an expert to talk to your group. You can talk to a literature professor or local writer for generic books. If you are reading a book about a specific topic, you could also have an expert from that field come to your group and talk.
Read something local and visit the places mentioned in the book. Oftentimes, you can find a book that centers around your hometown or a nearby area. Read that book and take a field trip to the places mentioned in it.

, Have a contact list with addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses. Whenever there is a change, make sure to personally speak with each member to inform him or her of the change. If possible, you may even want to set up an email group or online community to make communication between members easier.

Stick with space-oriented sub-genres.,
Make time for time.,
Think of the future.,
Escape to an alternate reality.,
Be a punk.,
Focus on technology.,
Determine whether you want hard sci-fi or soft sci-fi.,
Mix and match sub-genres.,
Branch into other speculative fiction.,
Compile a list of classics.,
Pull books off the bestseller list.",How to Start a Science Fiction Book Club1," Space is one of the most commonly explored themes in science fiction, but within the broad category of “space,” there are a number of different sub-genres for you to build your book list from. These sub-genres include alien invasions, the colonization of different worlds, first contact, galactic empires, space exploration, and space operas.;
, Time travel is nearly as popular as space travel. It may be a little more difficult to find a plethora of time travel books, but you can weave one into your book list on occasion to mix things up.

, The majority of science fiction books take place at some point in the future, even those books that are oriented with space or technology. For some sci-fi sub-genres, however, thinking about the future is the main point rather than merely a setting detail. Books that fall within the dystopian, human development, and pos-apocalyptic sub-genres are especially future-oriented.

, Books are a sort of escape in and of themselves, but you can offer the members of your book group an even greater sense of escape by filling your book roster with alternate reality sub-genres. Alternate realities include alternate histories and timelines, parallel dimensions, and virtual reality.

, The ""punk"" sub-genres are fairly recent, but growing in popularity. Steampunk is the most notable ""punk"" sub-genre, but others, like cyberpunk, have since come into creation as well. Steampunk takes place in Victorian-esque settings but weaves fantastical steam and gear powered inventions into the story. Cyberpunk pairs cybernetic technology with a breakdown of social order.

, Technological feats are probably just as popular a theme in science fiction as space exploration. A book club focused on technology-based science fiction has a wide range of sub-genres to choose from, including artificial intelligence, nano-technology, mind uploading, and singularity—the idea of a major but short-live technological boom.

, Hard sci-fi focuses on scientific accuracy, and most hard sci-fi deals with technology. Soft sci-fi relies more heavily on sciences that are less precise, such as psychology and anthropology.

, If you only have an interest in certain types of science fiction, then you should build your club and its book roster around that interest. If, however, you have an interest in science fiction no matter what the genre is, you can spice things up by planning a book club that will cover a range of topics.

, Sometimes the boundaries between science fiction, fantasy, and horror get blurred. For instance, some science fiction takes place in a future that has, for whatever reason, reverted back into fantasy-like sword-and-sorcery state. Similarly, some post-apocalyptic books portray a world filled with the grotesque mutants and violence common to the horror genre. You can really push the envelop by including a few books that could be classified within these other genres.

, If you do not know where to start, consider paying homage to the classics that helped build the science fiction genre into what it is today. The list of science fiction classics includes, but is certainly not limited to, H.G. Wells's The Time Machine and War of the Worlds, Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, Isaac Asimov's I, Robot, Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game, George Orwell's 1984, and Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451.

, When all else fails, pull titles off bestselling science fiction lists. Science fiction bestsellers usually consist of both recent titles and classics being turned into movies.

Settle on a number.,
Contact friends and family.,
Advertise.",How to Start a Science Fiction Book Club2," A group that is too small may not have much to say, but a group that is too large may prevent some people from participating. Usually, groups that range between 5 and 15 people are a good size. Smaller groups will create a more personal atmosphere, but slightly larger groups will allow for a greater exchange of ideas and may be ideal for science fiction book clubs.

, Ask anyone you know who likes science fiction to join your group. You can also bring it up to people who do not like sci-fi and ask them to pass word along to anyone they know who might be interested.

, Put posters up in your local library or create ads on free online classifieds. You can also advertise in science fiction forums online. Even though these forums already offer members the chance to discuss their favorite stories, some members may also be interested in participating in an actual book club, especially if they want to meet with local sci-fi fanatics in person.

Find a good meeting place.,
Settle on a convenient meeting time.,
Figure out how often to meet.,
Make use of technology.,
Cover the ground rules.,
Learn how to lead.",How to Start a Science Fiction Book Club3," The size of your group will likely impact the space you need in a meeting place. Homes tend to work well for smaller groups, but library conference rooms and restaurants with secluded sections tend to work better for larger groups.


Alternatively, you can also meet online. If your members are scattered across a broad distance or simply prefer to interact via the computer, you can set up your own blog, e-mail list, or forum to facilitate discussion.







, In order to set up a time, you need to balance your members' schedules. After dinner tends to be a popular choice, since most people work during the morning and afternoon, and participants with young children can put their kids down for the night before attending. Meeting well after dinner also means that you do not need to provide a meal.

, If you want to discuss your books as you read them, then you may consider meeting every one or two weeks. If you prefer to discuss the books only after you finish them, however, you may opt for meeting on a monthly basis, especially since many science fiction books are fairly long and may take that long to finish if your members have busy schedules.

, This is a science fiction book club, after all, so the odds or running into a member with a technology phobia is rare. Even if you meet offline and in person, you can still set up a blog or online forum to facilitate discussion in between meetings. You should also keep contact with your group via e-mail to inform them of any changes or other pertinent information.

, Stress the importance of reading the books and making the meetings. Without these two elements, your book club will completely fall apart. You should also make sure that each member knows when your club meets, how long meetings will last, and any rules surrounding the discussion of books in your club.

, You will need to decide whether you will moderate each session or if you will take turns with other members. You should also determine whether to follow a formal set of discussion questions or if you would rather have a loose, casual conversation about the books.

Find your celebrities fanmail address.,
Write an autograph request letter to your celebrity.,
Slip your piece of cardboard, letter, and photo into your small envelope.,
Seal your smaller envelope and slip it inside your larger envelope.,
Take your envelopes to the post office and have them weigh and stamp the smaller sealed envelop by itself.,
Send your autograph request envelope.

",How to Send an Autograph Request," A good database for fanmail addresses is Fanmail.biz. If their address isn't on Fanmail, try Googling the celebrity's address. Or check their Twitter. A lot of celebrities give out their fanmail address via Twitter.;
, Make sure you say why you are writing and politely request an autograph from them. As a general guideline, handwritten is best, your letter should be no more than a page long, and its best to keep it semi professional. Some celebrities are a little put off by letters that are overly 'fan girly.' Make sure you sign the letter with your name, some celebrities will look at how you sign it to personalize their autograph to you.

, Make sure everything lays flat. If you are sending the request from another country, to the US, put in several IRC's (International Reply Coupons), which will allow the celebrity to get the correct postage to return your photo after they have signed it. You can only get IRC's at your post office/FedEx/etc.

, Do not seal the larger envelope.

, Then put the already stamped smaller envelope inside the larger one. Seal the larger envelope with the smaller inside it. Have them weigh and stamp the larger envelope now.

Follow your idol on social media sites.,
Post thoughtful comments.,
Respond to your idol's social media messages.,
Share your idol's social media messages.,
Contact your idol directly through social media sites.",How to Meet Your Idol1," Social media has made the world a smaller place, making people like celebrities who were previously inaccessible to us much more so. It also benefits celebrities to have followers because the more fans they have, the more endorsements they get and products they sell. It also influences their pay scale and opportunities for more work. The two primary sites for connecting with your idol are Facebook and Twitter.With Facebook, you can follow someone even if you are not “friends,” as long as the person has made his or her profile available to the public. For many high-profile public figures, Facebook verifies the person is who he or she claims to be, placing a blue badge, or check mark, next to the person's name.With Twitter, you can follow whomever you want. However, you cannot directly message someone who does not also follow you, nor will your tweets appear in the other person’s feed.Finally, while you cannot “follow” your idol on LinkedIn, you can “connect” with other LinkedIn members by sending them requests.;
, If you’re able to post comments, based upon how the person has set up his or her account, comment upon what you like about his or her work, how it inspires you, ways in which you may have used it for charitable purposes and the like. Avoid overdoing it. You should not post multiple times per day, let alone multiple times per week. That begins to look like stalking and will not get you what you want – contact with your idol. You could also find yourself blocked.If your posting(s) goes unnoticed or if it takes a long time to get a response, don’t get upset. Celebrities are inundated with requests for their time, along with messages and a steady stream of social media chatter.
And never leave a snarky remark in response to feeling rejected or for any other reason. Doing so will drastically decrease your chances of meeting your idol.
Additionally, keep in mind that while some celebrities work on all aspects of their social media sites themselves, others do not. Instead, they hire agencies to do this for them., This is another way to get on your idol’s radar. Again, you want to be thoughtful in your replies. Demonstrate that you’re not only articulate but that you also know about what you’re writing. Opinions are great, but opinions backed by facts, including references to things demonstrating to your idol you’ve been a longtime fan, are better. Also consider sharing something you’ve created that relates to what your idol is discussing.On Facebook, you simply comment on the person’s post if public comments are allowed. On Twitter, you can reply to your idol’s tweet; however, replies will not show up on his or her home timeline if your idol doesn’t follow you., One way to get your idol to notice you, and hopefully to respond, is by sharing their messages and content, particularly those they ask fans to share. For example, if your idol asks followers to repost or retweet information pertaining to his or her favorite charity, an upcoming performance or event, a personal statement contradicting tabloid rumors or a statement supporting another in the industry, do so., Send your idol a message a) explaining who you are and b) either asking him or her a question or explaining why you’d like to talk or meet. Be polite and professional. Don’t start off by telling your idol how you’re his or her biggest fan ever or that you’ve listened to every album ever recorded. A lot of people have. You need to stand out, and to do that you should do the opposite of what most fans do when writing letters and messaging their idols. In other words, don’t gush, blabber, use too many exclamation points, include hearts or other emoticons, express your undying devotion and love, etc.


Write to your idol politely, in a clear and concise manner and using a standard letter format. Quickly get to the point, which is to either ask a question or explain why you want to talk or meet. Next give your idol a compelling reason to want to respond.Except under certain circumstances (he’s your professor or there are serious time constraints, for example), it could be in your best interests to start a dialog before diving right in and asking to meet your idol first.
You might consider creating a video or slideshow instead of a letter, as long as it is short, professional and to the point. Skip the singing and dancing.
Don’t be afraid to contact your idol again in a few weeks. Remember, he or she is likely a very busy person. When doing so, begin by referring back to your previous message and include it below the second.

Go to book signings.,
Buy VIP tickets.,
Pay for fan clubs or upgraded fan-club levels.,
Attend movie premieres, awards programs, film festivals and other ticketed events.,
Do what your idol does.",How to Meet Your Idol2," Your idol may be a relatively unknown but up-and-coming author who’s set to sign books at Barnes & Nobles next month in your city. Here’s your change to meet her! Book signings are also a great way to meet both world figures and celebrities. Increasingly, celebrities are writing memoirs and actresses and actors are appearing at signings that coincide with the openings of the movies they starred in from that particular book series.In almost all cases, you are required to buy the book from the bookstore hosting the signing, so make sure you bring along enough money to buy one.
Consider buying more than one book, so you have extra time with your idol.
To find out if your idol is having a book signing for a recently published book, look for a social media announcement from your idol; go to the publisher's website and its social media sites; look on major retailers' websites like Barnes & Noble; and talk with local bookstores, particularly if you live in a major metropolitan area., In case you’ve always wondered but never thought to ask, VIP means “very important person.” You can be one, too, for the right price. Usually, that price is high. Yet purchasing VIP tickets to concerts, plays, comedy shows, the ballet and sporting events come with a variety of perks. One of those perks is often a “meet and greet pass.” Depending upon the event, this could mean you meet your idol or that you meet someone or several people that are part of, for example, a ballet troupe or a baseball team. This could include your idol.You also often get a photograph as a part of VIP packages, and, in some cases, much more, such as invites to pre- or post-event parties. Make sure that you read the details carefully.
You can get VIP tickets in a number of ways – from ticketing services like VIPNation.com, Ticketmaster.com, VIPTickets.com, Premiumseatsusa.com and from the venues and organizations themselves.
Not all events will have VIP tickets, and you’ll want to buy them either through pre-sales offers or within minutes of tickets going on sale for many events.

, Often, joining an official fan club is free, and with some you can get one of the most coveted perks of belonging to a fan club – being included in a lottery or drawing to win a meet and greet pass after you buy a ticket to a show or event. Frequently, however, this opportunity is only available when you upgrade your membership, or pay for a higher level. Plenty of fan clubs, however, are not free for even basic membership. Many of these, such as certain major league sports team fan clubs, will go beyond basic meet and greets and include invitations to dinners and other events.Some of the other benefits of upgrading and paying for fan clubs include access to dress rehearsals and practices where you might get more than a handshake and a photo, online chats and conference calls and dibs on pre-sales tickets (which can help get VIP tickets)., While major movie awards programs like the Golden Globes and the Oscars are virtually impossible to get tickets to, even for those in the industry, others such as the BET Music Awards are possible. These, along with movie premieres and film festivals, give you an opportunity to potentially meet countless celebrities.If your idol is less well known, see if he or she has a website that lists upcoming speaking events or performances nearby or in your area. Some may even be free.
Here’s a good site for finding tickets for movie premieres, film festivals and awards shows: thevipconcierge.com.

, This might be leaning to the stalker side, but if you know that your idol works out a particular gym, for instance, you might consider joining the same gym. If you know that your idol always attends Lakers games and sits in a specific spot, you might try to get seats nearby. If, for example, your idol is your town’s former mayor, and she eats at the same diner every Wednesday for lunch, you might eat there as well. Strike up a conversation and offer to pay for her lunch!"
"
Get a press pass.,
Attend free speeches, lectures, demonstrations and gallery openings.,
Use your connections and network.,
Obtain tickets to talk shows.,
Wait by theater stage doors.,
Go to filmings.,
Be a seat filler at awards shows.,
Enter and hopefully win a contest.,
Get a job where your idol goes.,
Find a way backstage.,
Determine where your idol is staying.",How to Meet Your Idol3," Optimally, you would already be a legitimate member of the media and, therefore, have an opportunity to get a press pass allowing you backstage for a variety of events. Press passes aren’t, however, given to all media outlets for all events as they’re limited in number. If you’re not a working member of the media, consider joining your student newspaper; getting an internship at a local newspaper, radio or TV station; or offering to cover the event for free for a local publication.


However you go about it, the rewards could be substantial – time spent interviewing your idol, hanging around after the event and even perhaps striking up a friendship.If you’re an indie blogger or journalist, email the event organizer or press contact person several weeks before the event, explain who you are and what you do, provide links to work samples and request a press pass for the event. Call in one week if you didn't receive a reply to your email.Additionally, it might be helpful to become a member of the International Association of Freelance Journalists, which can help bloggers and freelancers get press credentials.

, For many, their idols aren’t seemingly untouchable multi-millionaires that appear to exist in an alternate universe. They are emerging or just really good local artists and musicians, retired academics or NASA engineers, activists from the 1960s civil rights movement or small-city gardening experts. Going to these types of events provide excellent opportunities to meet your idol and likely walk away with more than an autograph or photo.


To find out about these events, read your local newspapers and magazines; look for fliers posted at public libraries and in other public places; visit college, university and local tourist websites and the like.

, You know someone who knows someone whose cousin went to school with your idol. Sometimes all it takes to hit pay dirt is to look through your all your contacts and start making calls to people you think might know someone to get you to the person with direct access to your idol. As they say, there’s only six degrees of separation between any two people. Also, social networking sites can be very useful tools in this endeavor, so don’t overlook them!If it doesn’t happen immediately, create new relationships and cultivate the old to get you closer. You never know when someone you might have scratched off your list is suddenly back in touch with a missing link.

, Celebrities and public figures frequently appear on talk shows, in large part to promote their latest ventures or agendas – new movies, TV shows, clothing lines, albums, books, causes, charities and so forth. Most daytime and evening talk shows are free, though you often have to wait a long time to get tickets, if you ever do. Nonetheless, if you do manage to get a ticket, you might just meet your idol either during the show, if you’re very lucky, or before if you play your cards right. Here’s how it works and what you need to do.


Often celebrity guests will arrive about an hour before the taping through a side door. In many cases, like with major stars or public figures, some type of barrier is erected.You’ll a) need to know if and when your idol is appearing on a talk show, b) where the stage door is located prior to the day of taping and c) ensure you're there about 2 hours early.
Bring whatever you want signed, something easy to write with (like a felt-tip pen), your camera fully charged and ready, a smile and good manners.Taping schedules and guest lists are on each show’s website, or you can look here, too: onlocationvacations.com/talk-show-guest-schedule.

, Waiting outside theater stage doors is a bit different from talk shows in that theatre productions have both matinee and evening shows, sometimes require actors spending a long time in make-up and often travel from one city to another. It’s often best to avoid the matinee shows as actors may not leave before the evening performance. Friday and Saturday nights aren’t the best times either because you’ll be one amongst so many fighting for your idol’s attention. Finally, don’t go to the last night of the show because the crew will often be packing up to leave. Here are some more tips.


Try to stand near the theater wall just to the left or to the right of the stage door to, essentially, block your idol’s way before he or she can get too far.
If there's a large crowd, stand back, directly opposite from the door and wait until the crowd breaks before approaching. You may even have more time with your idol this way.
Always be polite, congratulate your idol on a great performance, have your paper or playbill, pen and camera ready and say thank you., Television shows and movies film in cities around the world, though many are filmed in Los Angeles and New York City. If you happen to live where a show or movie is being filmed, you might randomly stumble upon a filming. But if you’re focusing on meeting your idol, you need to know where to look. Research what your idol is next starring in and then find out where the show or movie will be shot. Here’s a site to help determine this: onlocationvacations.com. Once there, find your idol’s trailer and navigate around security so you can wait outside of it.It’s certainly not subtle, but if you are polite and don’t behave in a way to frighten your idol, you might get a quick chat and a photo.

, Because producers don’t want viewers to see empty seats when the cameras are directed at the audience, they hire people to wait in the proverbial wings to slide into these seats when people go to the stage or take inevitable bathroom breaks. Being a seat filler won’t be glamorous, and you likely won’t be paid. You may not fill your idol’s seat, but you might. Or, perhaps, your idol could be sitting nearby and whomever left the seat never returns! You may even get lucky while you’re standing in the periphery before, during or after the show., Oftentimes radio stations put on contests for tickets, backstage passes and meet and greets for upcoming concerts. It often goes like this, “Be the 6th lucky caller, and you’ll win two VIP tickets and backstage passes to see AC/DC Friday night at Alltel Arena!” Other times the DJs will ask the caller to answer an odd quiz and, increasingly, you simply fill out a form on the station’s website to enter a drawing.A variety of other companies and organizations participate in contests for free tickets and sometimes amazing winnings, not only to concerts but also to sporting, cultural and theatrical events., This might take some semi-stalking, but if you can find out where your idol regularly eats or shops, try to get a job there. This might provide more interaction with your idol than most of the other means discussed. After all, if you’re helping your idol find the perfect book for his mother’s birthday, you’ll likely end up talking a good bit. Or, if you’re doing a good job as a waitress or waiter, you won’t only list the specials, take his or her order and deliver your idol’s drink and food., Unless you have a press pass, are a crew member, special to a member of the band or other group performing, affiliated with the band or group or bought a special VIP package, it’ll be tough getting a backstage pass. With that said, it can be done in one of three primary ways. The first relates to bands and involves joining or creating a ""street team,"" or a group of people who promote a band, both on the streets and now online. The second is by getting a job working at the venue where the event will be held. And the third requires a lot of schmoozing. Here’s how it works.First, if you didn’t get a job working at the venue, go to the venue and start chatting up the venue workers prior to the event. Be very friendly and offer to help.
If this doesn’t work, try to make friends with the opening acts when they arrive and see if you can get a pass that way. Express a sincere interest in their music and in your desire to meet more people involved in the tour.
If this fails, move on to the concert crew (they’ll typically be the ones dressed in black). Offer to help move things and set up equipment, talk about the tour, throw out hints and see if anyone bites.And if all of this fails, and you’re still dying to meet your idol, the tour bus will be in the parking lot near the back entrance or by the loading dock. But be warned, roadies may be around with hopes of their own., And for the final, and perhaps most creepy, means of meeting your idol, find out the hotel in which he or she is staying and then wait outside. The best way to do this is to check out paparazzi photos online to determine his or her location.Or, spend a couple of evenings in the hotel bar in hopes of meeting your idol. Another option is nefarious, and not particularly wise, but possibly successful. Follow the band (or other group of which your idol belongs) and its entourage to the hotel, walk in with them as if obviously a guest, grab a drink and mingle ... but not with the band or security, at least not at first."

Wait for an official “meet and greet.” Selena Gomez will have occasional meet-and-greet events.,
Monitor her other tours and events.,
Listen to the radio.Checking her website for public events will only provide you with the same chance of meeting her that any other fan has.,
Watch the Disney Channel.",How to Meet Selena Gomez1," These events are specifically planned out for the purpose of bringing her together with her fans. If you want to meet her in a setting that will allow you to talk to her for a few minutes, this might be your best option.


You can check on currently scheduled events by visiting the “Events” or “Tour” section of her official website.
While these events are often listed on her website, other sources (Disney, various radio stations, etc.) may sponsor such events as well.;
, The most common way to see Selena Gomez in person is to go to one of her concerts when her tour stops in a nearby city. While there is no guarantee that you will be able to meet her face-to-face, there might be a brief period after the concert ends during which she can meet a few fans from the audience.


The odds are against you when you attempt this method. If you go to one of her concerts, do so with the primary objective of attending the concert and watching her perform. Meeting her can be a secondary goal but you should not count on it.
A list of her current tour dates can be found under the “Events” page of her website.

, Radio stations that play her music may occasionally sponsor contests that would allow the winner to meet her. Make sure that you're listening to radio stations that play her music. Stations that play a different genre of music will not offer such contests because they would not appeal to their general audience.


Listen to the contest rules before you call in. Some contests require contestants to be 18 years of age or older. If you are not 18 years old you may need an adult to enter on your behalf.

, Every so often the Disney Channel will announce a contest through which you can meet one of your favorite affiliated stars. Given the rarity and unpredictability of these contests, it could take a long time before there is a contest that would allow you to meet Selena Gomez.


You can also monitor current Disney Channel events by following its social media accounts.

However, If your circumstances are peculiar enough there is some chance that you might be invited to one of her events free of charge. The easiest way to send Selena Gomez a written note is through one of her social media pages.

, Selena Gomez is involved with many well-known charities, including UNICEF.If you get involved with some of the causes and charities that she’s involved in your paths may cross during a charity event. Your contribution or involvement will usually need to be somewhat significant if you hope to get invited to the same events.


For example, you could join her cause by volunteering with UNICEF or starting a UNICEF club at your high school. If you do other charity work, you may also be nominated as a UNICEF ""do-gooder,"" which would draw attention to you and your efforts.

, If you are a terminally ill child and your biggest wish is to meet with Selena Gomez, you can make a request through the Make-a-Wish Foundation. This organization is dedicated to granting the wishes of children who face serious illnesses and this sort of request is not especially unusual. In fact, Selena Gomez has even been known to respond to wishes made through the Make-a-Wish-Foundation in the past.To have your wish granted by the foundation, you must have a referral. The referral can come from yourself, a parent, or a medical professional. You must be between the ages of 2-1/2 and 18 at the time of referral, and you must have a life-threatening medical condition., She may show up to some events that involve a variety of stars without focusing specifically on her. The crowds at these events tend to be large so meeting her there might be difficult. However, it isn’t impossible! If you want to have a chance at meeting her, make sure you show up to these events early so you can get in.


For example, Selena Gomez may attend events put on by the Disney Channel even if that event is not described as a meet-and-greet contest.
If she has been nominated for something, she may even show up at the Nick Choice Awards. You can check on whether or not she is a nominee by visiting the official award show website: http://www.nick.com/kids-choice-awards/

Dress to impress.,
Express your excitement.,
Ask for an autograph or photograph.,
Be polite.",How to Meet Selena Gomez3," Meeting Selena Gomez could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. You do not need to wear anything formal but try to put your best foot forward regarding your clothes and appearance. Doing so could make you stand out from the rest of the crowd and improve your chances of being noticed.


Consider wearing a fan shirt. You can buy an official concert tour shirt or you could make your own shirt that has text or images expressing how big of a fan you are.
Consider putting together an outfit together with garments from her clothing line, ""Dream Out Loud.""

, Show excitement when you see her to make yourself stand out in the crowd. If you actually get to meet her one-on-one, express your enthusiasm in your words, tone of voice, and body language to leave the strongest impression possible and to make the occasion memorable for everyone.


Most celebrities will enjoy hearing how much you love their work. Consider saying something along the lines of, ""I love your new album. ‘Revival’ is my favorite song!”
Avoid touching her without permission. If you’d like a hug be sure to ask her first. Never grab her arms or reach for her – that’s the quickest way to lose her attention.

, Don't be pushy. These mementos are great ways to remember meeting her and depending on the circumstances she might oblige. However, there could be some situations in which such actions are not feasible. If your request is denied, accept that fact and move on.


For example, if you ask her for her autograph while she’s trying to get to an event she may not have time to stop for you.

, Courtesy is always important no matter what but you should be especially courteous during a moment like this. After all, being remembered as someone who caused a disruption or created a problem could have serious long-lasting consequences. Besides, who would want their idol to remember them as a rude person?


Be courteous when approaching her. If you spot her by chance while she is clearly in the middle of a date, meal, or casual evening out, it would be polite to leave her alone.

Act and dress the part: As with a job interview, a date, or any other important event you need to dress and act appropriately.,
Be cool.

,
Dress gangster, but not too gangster.

,
Wear biker style sunglasses.

,
Relate culturally: People are naturally attracted and feel comfortable around others with similar interests, life styles, language, etc.,
Date a stripper.,
Get Tattoos like Jesse James.,
Drive a cool car with lots of power and individualism.,
Be in the right place at the right time: Jesse James often attends or participates in motor sports events in the Los Angeles area.,
Attend low key events in the Los Angeles area, such as the OCTO VW bus show.",How to Meet Jesse James," This is true for meeting Jesse James as well:;
,,,, While it would be difficult to duplicate Jesse's success and fame, there are some things you do that may help you relate:

, Jesse James' last wife was an exotic dancer, aka stripper. By dating a stripper you will have something in common.

, Jesse has many Tattoos including one on the palm of his hand that says; ""Pay up sucker"". You probably don't want to duplicate his ink, but Tattoos will give you something to talk about.

, Jesse has a fleet of vehicles and shows interest in all types of modified and powerful cars, trucks and motorcycles.

, Pick events where there are not likely to be huge crowds to increase your chances of making contact with him:

, Jesse and other celebrities have been seen at VW and Porsche events in LA, chatting with vehicle owners. The photo above shows Jesse and an average guy hanging out. Jesse doesn't seem to mind that he has a dirty shirt and dirty hands.

Consider your location.,
Get involved in something that brings you close to celebrities.,
Attend a meet n' greet.,
Send your celebrity mail.,
Meet a celebrity through a mutual acquaintance.,
Maintain your composure.,
Treat the celebrity as you would anyone else.Although it depends on their level of fame, famous people tend to be used to people sucking up to them or going nuts at their mere presence.,
Remember to be polite.,
Add your two cents to the conversation.Most people approach meeting a celebrity as a one-sided ordeal.,
Know when to say goodbye.",How to Meet a Famous Person," Location is everything. If you want to maximize your chances of running into celebrities, it's important to consider where you live and how likely famous people are to frequent your neighbourhood. Cultural hubs like Los Angeles, New York and London are far better-suited to meeting celebrities than any small town.


Check online to see if there are any places in your city where celebrities are known to hang out.Even if you're already living in a right city to meet somebody famous, you should consider the spots you frequent. Different environments will attract different kinds of famous people, but ritzy environments like nightclubs and fancy restaurants are the most likely place to run into celebrities.;
, Think of the kinds of people that brush shoulders with famous people on a regular basis. Media and field-specific professionals (like film set crew etc.) are used to dealing with celebrities because it's part of their job to do so. If you're interested in meeting a famous person, you might try getting involved in something that will put you on the front lines. Start a webzine, and try to get press passes into media events. Send requests to press agents to interview celebrities. Depending on the level of fame the person has, your chances of getting a response may be low.


Doing something like this will make your interaction with a celebrity much more fluid and natural than if you were approaching them purely as a fan.
Many celebrities use their fame to advance pet causes they are personally passionate about. For instance, you might show an interest in the VIP's charity of choice and volunteer time into it. This will immediately offer common ground between the two of you with which to build a mutually respectful relationship.

, Meet n' greets are specifically there for fans to meet their idols, and vice-versa. Although you won't likely have a lot of time to talk to the celebrity in question, its still a controlled and relatively certain way of meeting a famous person you respect. If you do end up chatting, make sure it's convenient for the celebrity.Check online for scheduled appearances. Most celebrities have a webpage that will catalogue or list all of their public appearances. If your availability permits, you might try going to one of them.
Touring bands often have meet n' greets prior to going on stage. n the case of bands, you can sometimes purchase VIP ticket packages to meet the musicians before the performance as well. VIP packages tend to be significantly more expensive than regular tickets, so weigh the benefits and whether or not the cost is worth it to you.

, Even if meeting the celebrity in person is out of the question at the moment, you can still send an email letting him know you respect his work and achievements. Given that the schedules of famous people don't allow much time for dawdling, it's important to keep your email relatively brief.State briefly who you are and what you do, followed by a short body of the message where you'll speak your piece.


Don't get bogged down in detail. An excessively long email will probably be deleted before it's ever read.
If your email leaves room for the possibility of a response, don't hold your breath. Even if the person gets around to responding, it may be weeks or even months before a proper response gets through.

, Just like anyone else, the best way to meet a famous person is via a mutual friend. If you're meeting the VIP through someone they already respect, it will bode well for the way they react towards you. More importantly, you'll be meeting the celebrity on relatively equal grounds compared to the imbalanced fan interaction he is probably used to., Most famous people will react in a fairly predictable manner if someone is going nuts over them. Unless the celebrity in question is a total diva, chances are she isn't going to want to have a fuss made over her. If you are talking to a famous person, your best bet is to interact with them much as you would with a regular person you have respect for

.

If you don't think you can meet this person without bursting into hysterics, it's probably best to hold off on meeting the person altogether.

, If you stay calm and act towards them like you would anyone else, they will feel soothed by your presence. Act as you regularly would. If you're not focused so much on the fact that you're in the presence of a celebrity, the interaction will turn out much more fluidly.

, If the famous person you are talking to has been featured in tabloids lately, it's probably not a good idea to bring that up.In fact, it is best that you try to steer clear of anything of a potentially inflammatory nature. Although it may be celebrity gossip to everyone else, this person has a life, and he may not want to talk about it, especially with someone he's just met.


On the topic of politeness, you should ask before taking pictures. While it might feel very important for you to get a souvenir of the occasion, snapping a photograph is really inconsiderate.
Politeness includes not interrupting a conversation between the celebrity and someone else. While you may be desperate to get an inch in, it's not gong to do anything to get you in the VIP's good graces., While it indeed may be more special to meet someone you've only seen before in newspapers or films, that doesn't mean the conversation should be all about the celebrity. Don't be afraid to give your opinions. Comment on things that have nothing to do with the fact that the person you're talking to happens to be famous. Not only will you feel empowered by sharing your opinions with a celebrity; the celebrity himself is also bound to get a lot more out of the conversation.


If you want to have some kind of lasting relationship with this person, there needs to be mutual respect. That means you have to take your interactions to a higher level than simple fandom., Keeping celebrities' tight schedules in mind, the last thing you want to do is hog up their time. In some cases, a celebrity may be too polite than to tell you he needs to get out of there. You should bear their time in mind, and don't keep them occupied more than would seem appropriate.


When it comes time to say goodbye, extend your hand and give them a warm greeting as you would with anyone else. Treating someone with warmth and compassion will leave a big impression. That rings true regardless whether someone is famous or not.

Support their work in the porn industry.",How to Meet a Porn Star in Your Area," Porn conventions usually take place in large facilities like convention halls. Some porn star conventions travel around, while others are stationary annually. Check newspapers, magazines, or online to find out when and where shows are. They will list them in ""events"" or ""news."" Make sure to write down the location and time on a piece of paper so you do not forget., This is critical because porn conventions are usually packed. People reserve their tickets months ahead of time. Therefore, the conventions will be almost impossible to get into the day of. Use the online site of the porn convention, or use the phone number you find in the newspaper/magazine to preorder tickets., Each picture and/or signature of a porn star costs money, as does the initial entry fee. There are also plenty of sex toys, novelties, and food to purchase. Carry some extra money in your wallet/purse. Make sure that you carry cash, in case some booths do not accept credit cards., While you are seeking a porn star nearby, the convention hall is likely not to be next door to your house. That means you will need to schedule ahead how long you need to drive, how much gas you will need, a hotel to stay in(if overnight), and bus tickets to get to the hall itself. Use an online hotel website to find the perfect place to stay. Use sites like Google Maps to find nearby busing/public transportation near the convention center., A trip to a porn convention is not for everyone. Choose friends who are open minded. Ask them what they think about porn. Whether they have any favorite porn actresses/actors. A group of close girls/guys almost always works best. If you are an open-minded couple, this might be something you are interested in as well., Your porn stars only appear at certain times, at certain locations within the convention hall. Print out a copy of the event schedule, usually found on their online website. Map out when and where you need to be, and estimate how long it will take you to walk to each location. You can also pick up a schedule when you enter the convention hall, but you won't be able to plan ahead., Outside porn conventions are usually a set of protestors, of a religious/moral nature. These are to be expected. There are also those who ""flash"" throughout the convention hall. This is also to be expected. Porn conventions are a mixed bag, full of surprises, so go into it with an open mind.

, People start camping out to these events, sometimes days in advance. While it is not necessary to get there that early, you should try to get there when it opens. This will alleviate some of the more heavy traffic you might experience in the convention hall during primetime hours. You can also get some of your desired visits out of the way, and just relax the rest of the time there.

, Find the location of your favorite porn star to get your movies, posters, and pictures signed. You will also want to bring a camera so that you can get your picture taken with him or her. Spend time chatting, whether it be small talk, or how much you appreciate their work. This is your chance to meet and interact, so take advantage of your time., While nudity is prohibited at these conventions, there are usually porn stars or strippers dancing. They might be doing this on a pole or on stage. Feel free to watch and have a good time., While you can certainly ask porn stars questions at their individual booths, there tend to be lines. This means you have to get in and out in an timely manner. However, often times porn stars conduct forums at these conventions. These are times where porn stars open up on stage about their personal and professional life. Feel free to ask them questions you have about them, or the industry as a whole., While meeting a porn star in the flesh can be difficult, you can always find them online. Plenty of sites showcase professional and amateur porn stars who ""cam."" This is where they interact through text/chat while they strip. Because a lot of these stars are amateurs, you might even be able to meet up with one of them for one-on-one time. The first major step is to search for ""cam girls/guys"" online, and find some that you are interested in., Whether you are in a public chatroom, or in private one-on-one time, it is important that you are serious in your dialogue. Do not use slang, or be rude to the model. Be respectful, and have a decent conversation, whether it be small talk or sexual in nature. Ask them questions about their life, what they like to do in bed, or fun hobbies they have. These are not objects, but human beings with real emotions., Even if you are just joining a cam site to say hi and talk, it is important that you pay the star tips. Tips are usually a small dollar amount that you give them to show you appreciate them. This is often times how many of these stars make a living. It is rude to simply take advantage of them and not pay., You will need a credit card in order to pay the girls/guys tips. These sites are protected by security and privacy measures. However, if you do not feel comfortable giving out your credit number, these sites are probably not for you. Make sure that when you are charged, it is written down discretely on your credit card bill if you do not want to raise suspicion.

, Sometimes you might meet someone on a camming website and really hit it off. You might even want to meet the person in real life. In that case, it is important to set up the parameters beforehand. What time you are meeting, where you are meeting, and what you plan to do on that date. Is it purely sexual, a date, or simply a chance to have fun with another person? It is probably best to bring a friend along to bail you out, just in case you meet someone a little sketchy., There are plenty of people on the internet looking to make a fool out of someone. Whether it be standing them up on a date, or stealing their identity. It is always best to double and triple check information. Never meet someone outside of your home that you have not seen at least on a cam before. Never give out personal identity information online, or to someone you barely know.

, If you decide to go out on a date with the cam star it is best to treat it as a real date. Do not view the person as a sexual object. Ask them normal questions, like how your day is going, or what do you like to do. Focusing on his/her cam work can be nauseating and a turn-off. Instead, relax, and spend time getting familiar with the cam star., Unless you live in Los Angeles, it is very unlikely you will simply run into a porn star. However, you may meet someone online, like a cam star, whom you wish to meet up with. You may have also been introduced to a porn/cam star through a friend/acquaintance. In that case, it is best to treat the situation/meet-up professionally. Shake the person's hand, and tell them your name. Let them know what you do for a living. Share some background about your family, and origin., After you have introduced yourself, ask the person where he/she would like to go on a date. If you have ideas in mind for a restaurant, or movie this is even better. Be confident when you ask the person for the date, otherwise they might view you as being intimidated., Whether it be his/her eyes, hair, demeanor, dimples, laugh, sense of humor, or clothing style. Especially in the first couple of dates, it is best to stay away from talking porn too much. Obviously a little is necessary in order to understand their professional work, but don't overdo it. Focus on what makes the person an individual., While the person might have a higher sex drive, it is not up to you to judge simply because of the person's work. A date with a porn star is just like any other date. It is not a free chance at easy sex. Porn stars are people with feelings, and real human experiences. Focus on emotions, common goals in life, and passions. Look at the person as a soon wife/husband to be. Ask yourself, what good and bad qualities do you see in them? Do they reflect your own?, If you plan on dating a porn star, you are going to need to be accepting of their work. Each person chooses their own destiny in life. A few dates in, talk about some parameters. Maybe when and where they will be filming the pornographic movies. Discuss with them how their work conflicts and/or agrees with your own goals and beliefs."

Find out which celeb you want to meet!,
Use the web.,
Be careful.,
Find the 'Contact Me' button.,
Contact Them!,
If it doesn't work, go to YouTube!,
Find Them on YouTube.,
Their YouTube Channel.,
Start the Message.,
Write a Message!",How to Meet a Disney Star," Choose wisely because you may only get the chance to meet or contact one.;
, The celebrity you have chosen will probably have their own website or the fan website, most have both. Try typing in the celebrities name, for example, if you chose Hannah Montana, (not saying she is real) type in HannahMontana.com. Try this with your celebrity's name. No matter if there is a site or not, go to the regular Google search bar. Type in the celebrity's name then ""fan website."" Their fan website will most likely be in the first few search results. Visit both of those websites if they both come up.

, There is a pretty good chance that this website will not be their official website. Look for the title or the URL of the website. There will be names that include the word official in them. Check out lots of the website to be sure it is the real stars. They may say things about them, their schedule for tours and more, or have videos, pictures, and say things about their friends and family.

, Here is the part you need to read... just like the other parts. Anyway, there will (or definitely should) be something on their site that says ""Contact Me."" If they do not have that, keep searching. Once you have searched the whole entire website as much as possible and as thoroughly as possible, give up... on that certain website URL. If they had a fan website, go to that one and you should see that same ""Contact Me"" button.


Contact Me Button. If you have finally gotten to that magical button, it will most likely give you an address for you to send any letter to. They will probably also tell you how long it may take for a returning letter.

, Write the letter! This is your exciting moment so write everything you want to! Writing this may take weeks or even months, but don't forget anything. Remember not to talk too much about yourself, ask them questions, tell them why you chose them, and what you love about them. Also tell them a little bit about you, your life, and your personality. Do not give too much information for someone else may look over this letter.

, Go on YouTube! There is a huge chance they have a YouTube channel. To start out, in the YouTube search bar, try typing in the celebrity's first and last name (unless they go by one name only) and type in an apostrophe then the letter S. For example, if you are searching for Jennifer Lawrence, you should type in Jennifer Lawrence's channel in the YouTube search bar. If they go by one name, such as Zendaya, type in Zendaya's channel. Most stars with a channel have more than one, so if you think you have more than one that is really them, don't be totally shocked, but be sure it is them, because some people have almost identical usernames to them but one little number or letter different. You know this is a fake channel that is posing to be them.

, It could take hours to find them. This is very rare because most likely, unless they just created one, their channel is very well known.

, Once you have finally reached their YouTube channel, well... good job! Now. You must be a YouTube member to do the next steps. If you are not, create an account. You will see how to do this in the right top hand corner of the YouTube home page. If you don't want to create an account, your parents don't have to know because you don't need personal information and you don't even need videos on YouTube!

, Congrats. You are able to write a message once you know their YouTube channel and have a YouTube account. Once you are logged into your account, go to the YouTube home page. You will see somewhere if you click on something like your username or my channel, it will say Inbox. It may take a while, but you need to find the word Inbox. It will be in the right, top hand corner.

, Click on inbox. Click something like Create New Message or Compose New Message. Write what you want! Tell about how you got to writing a message, how you found them, a little bit about your personality, some stuff about you that is not personal, and ask them questions! Ask them stuff and don't leave out anything.

Plug your Kindle into a computer.,
Install DRM-removal software to your computer.As a way to prevent excess distribution, Kindle-bought books carry copyright protection that limits file copying and physical printing.,
Decrypt and copy your Kindle files.,
Convert the format.,
Select the files you want from a print-friendly program.,
Print and check your files.",How to Print from Kindle1," Unlike the tablet-based Kindle Fire HD, a regular Kindle lacks advanced utility beyond displaying ebooks. You can still print materials from it, but it requires you first hook it up to a computer as you normally would. Connect the Kindle to your computer via a USB cable. Within a few seconds, your computer should register the Kindle has linked up.;
, This is annoying, but it can be bypassed with the help of third-party software. Luckily, DRM-removal software is easy to download. Download a DRM-removal program specific to Kindles and install it to your computer.Make sure you're downloading from a reputable source. If there's an excess amount of marketing or 'special offers' attached to the download, it may be risky and worth taking time to seek out an alternative.

, DRM-removal programs will make a duplicate of the chosen ebook file without copyright protection, leaving the original intact. The file should otherwise be identical to the original.Once your removal software is installed, access the program and select the file(s) you'd like to have printed. The program will copy the files, stripping them of their DRM.

, Using a PC program like Kindle for PC, you can convert the cracked files (Kindle uses a unique .azw format) to a universal format, like .epub or .pdf.Though you won't be able to print a .azw file via Kindle for PC alone, converting it will allow you to access the file from a program that does offer printing utility, like Adobe Reader.


The Mac OS has similar programs available for it as well. Before you download a program, check the OS compatibility.

, Converting files via Kindle for PC should be a quick and easy process, as ereader files tend to be quite small by design. From there, you should access a third-party reader program like Adobe Reader or Calibre.Once a universal reader program is up, access the file you're looking to print off. A print button should be apparent from there.

, When you click the print button, you'll be prompted to input specific information for your print, including the number of copies you'd like made, and whether you would like the pages one or two-sided. Fill in the proper information and finalize the printing process.Provided the printer's connectivity is stable and it's properly filled with ink, the print should go through as planned. Once the pages are all printed, give them a check to make sure they have printed successfully. Count the number of pages, and ensure all of the pages have been adequately inked.


You may need extra cartridges if you're planning on printing off a larger file. If you're printing off a full book, it is recommended to make your pages two-sided, as it will make it easier to bind the pages together.

Select and prep the file you want to print.,
Print and check your physical copy.",How to Print from Kindle2," The Kindle Fire HD is distinct from a regular Kindle in the sense that acts like a tablet rather than solely as an eReader. You can connect to a Wi-Fi network as you normally would or any device. Join the network your printer is connected to. From there, your Kindle Fire will be able to transmit data directly to the printer. Once your device is given the proper info to connect with, it will connect automatically to the network in the future.


Going online with a Kindle Fire should be a painless process, though you will most likely be asked to input the Wi-Fi password. If you are having trouble hooking up, try making sure the device's Airplane Mode is turned off., As a tablet, you'll be able to access webpages and a variety of files with your Kindle Fire. The only files that may require tampering to print with are Kindle-bought .azw files. You will be able to print other files as you would a regular tablet. If you're trying to print Kindle-specific ebooks however, you'll need to download DRM-removal software. DRM removal software for Kindle publications is quite easy to find, and can be downloaded directly onto your Kindle Fire HD.Ensure the download is safe. You can usually get a good idea as to a file's worth based on the site ratings, number of times downloaded, and any comments that may be posted on the downloads page.

, In their original .azw form, you can't open Kindle files with a program that will allow you to transfer them to a more universal PDF form. With a Kindle Fire HD, you have the choice of downloading this software directly onto the tablet, or downloading the software onto a regular computer and converting the files there before transferring them to your Kindle. Kindle conversion software is very easy to use, and it shouldn't take more than a couple of minutes to get the whole process sorted through.Applicable programs are available for both Mac and PC.

, Unlike a regular Kindle eReader, you can download full programs onto your Kindle Fire HD. This comes in handy when it comes to printing, as you'll be able to use a program to print directly from the tablet, provided you're hooked up to a Wi-Fi network with a local printer. Although a generic office program like OfficeSuite will suit your purposes, there are actually specific printing apps for tablets like Android and Kindle you can download and use for this purpose., Using the print-friendly app, select the file you want to have printed. Although particulars will vary depending on the specific kind of program you're using, a print button should be easy to spot. Press it once you have the chosen file up, and fill out the applicable information for your print.You will be asked how many copies you would like, as well as whether your paper will be printed one or two-sided.


As with any printing, whether you decide to print one or two-sided should depend based on how long your text file is. Printing one-sided will conceivably result in having to harness twice as much paper, which may cause difficulties to bind if the file is large enough.
You will have to choose the printer you want to print to as well. This may be confusing if multiple printers are hooked up to the same local network. Check the printer for signs of a specific ID, and look for that in the list you're choosing from.

, Provided you have a stable Wi-Fi connection and the printer has been fed enough ink, your printing should go through without trouble. As with any printing operations, you should end things by taking a look at the printed copy. Make sure all of the pages have printed, and ensure all of the pages have been sufficiently inked. From there, bind the pages together (with a stapler or in a binder, depending on the number of pages) and title the beginning page so readers will know what they're holding.

You can highlight onscreen up and down or side to side based on which buttons you're pressing.
There are two next page buttons, one on either side to allow for different styles of holding the Kindle, but they both take you to the next page in whatever you're reading.
The previous page button takes to the page you were just on.
The home button, located above the next page button on the right side, takes you back to your library, also known as the content that is stored both in your Kindle and on Amazon.
The menu button is used to shows the application and navigation choices of whatever screen you're looking at. It's located above the the 5-way controller.
The back button is located below the 5-way controller and is used to retrace your steps. So, for instance, if you follow a link in a book, pressing back will take you back to the page in the book you were reading.
Your keyboard is used to enter search terms, notes or URLs. You will also find the symbol key, which shows a menu of different punctuation, and the text key, which manipulates text size and the number of words per page for easier reading.

, This will allow you to connect with Amazon and will be how you purchase and download items. You'll also need it to register your Kindle so that you can move items onto the device. The button is located in the back next to the On button.


Some Amazon Kindles come without a physical button to turn Whispernet on, but you can easily access the ""power"" for turning Whispernet on from directly on the device.
Press the Menu button from the Home screen.
Press the 5-way controller up once, until the cursor stops on ""Turn Wireless On"" or ""Turn Wireless Off"" and press enter.

, You have to register your Kindle to purchase and download items, so that is one of the first things you will want to do. You'll need to make sure that you have access to and have turned on Whispernet.


Go to the Menu button and, using the 5-way controller, select Settings. Still using the 5-way controller select the Register option under Settings. Enter your Amazon username and password (your email address and password for your Amazon account, if you have an account).
If you don't already have an Amazon account, you'll need to create one on the website before you can register your Kindle.

, The home screen is basically your Kindle bookshelf. It shows all of your purchases that are synced with your Kindle account. You can even store items on iCloud and access them using your kindle, as long as you have access to Whispernet.The home screen shows the following things: show options (what you want shown on the home screen), sort options (how you want your items sorted), title and author of your items, progress indicator (how far you are through an item), archived items (these are the things that are stored on Amazon, but aren't downloaded onto the Kindle).

, Amazon has lots of options, like newspapers, books, magazines, audiobooks. As long as you have Whispernet coverage, the items that you purchase can be immediately downloaded onto your Kindle.Press the Menu button when you are at your Home screen, then press Enter. When you arrive at the drop-down menu of options, it will default to Shopping in the Kindle Store.
Perform a search for your specific item. There are also different lists for items, like bestseller books, popular newspapers, and the like. You can peruse these titles if you aren't looking for something specific.
You will have to use 1-click for purchasing Kindle ebooks and other Kindle items, but there are ways to change your settings to make sure that you're using the correct credit or debit card account. You have to go into your online Amazon account. Go to Manage Your Kindle and then to Kindle Payment Settings.

, Even though you have to use the 1-click purchasing function for the Kindle, you can still make sure that you use gift certificates if you have them. It's simply a matter of updating your Kindle payment settings and then you can use the gift certificate up until it's finished.


Go to your account page on the Amazon website. Go to the payment section and clock ""Apply a Gift Certificate/Card to Your Account."" Put in your gift certificate number and click ""Apply to your Account.""

, You'll press the Enter key in the center of the 5-way controller to open your new selection and begin reading.

, Most non-touch screen Kindle's have full blown buttons on both of the sides, near the display. They can flip the page back and forward. The key labeled ""<"" moves the page back one page, while the "">"" moves it ahead.


On most books, you can use the 5-way controller's left and right arrow sides/buttons to flip around from chapter or unit to the next chapter (again, either backward or frontward ).
On most touchscreen enabled devices(with the exception of the Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD), you can just touch the side of the screen, or make a flipping motion while swiping the page in the direction (as if you're trying to turn a real book's pages). Meanwhile, this device has no way to jump from chapter to chapter except for going through the table of contents (if the book has one).

, Use the 5-way controller to select the passage, starting at the beginning of the passage you want highlighted. Press the Select button to finish highlighting.


You can also turn off the ""popular"" highlights that come with the book. Starting at your homepage, press Menu and then go to settings. In settings you'll find popular highlights. Click this to turn them off.

You can also get some game apps for your Kindle in the Kindle app store. There are free versions of Candy Crush Saga, Words with Friends, or a variety of action games.

Find ""Allow Installation of Applications"" or ""Apps from Unknown Sources"" and select On. Once you've done that you'll need to download a third-party android app like the 1Mobile Market app that lets you download their apps to your kindle. On your Kindle go to Web, and go to the website where you'll download the app. Select ""download"" and hit ""okay"" when the message box asks you whether you want to download or not. Go to the Amazon app store and download ES File Explorer (which will help you find your third-party app). Open up ES File Explorer, when it's done downloading, and go to the ""Downloads"" folder. In there, you'll find the third-party app you want to install. Select it, agree to the permissions, and select ""Install."" When it has finished installing, select ""Open.""

, Because Kindle tends to look at PDF files as they would a Kindle file (ie. each page in the PDF page shows up as 1 page) means that the text can get really small and hard to navigate. All you have to do is email the PDF file to your Kindle with ""convert"" in the subject line and the Kindle should convert the PDF to Kindle format.This is, however, an experimental program so it doesn't always work properly and tables can get a little messed up, but overall it's easier than trying to navigate the PDF file.
You can also have your device download regular PDF documents either converted to Kindle format or not (so you may read them instead of a book).

, There are times when you'll get into trouble with your Kindle for a variety of reasons. You may need to get it fixed by an expert, but before you panic you can try to few different ways to get it working. However, if your Kindle is constantly overheating the hardware itself is probably broken and you'll need to get a replacement.If your screen is frozen or slow (or won't turn on) try holding down the power button for 20 seconds. Set the timer to count down and then, after 20 more seconds, press the power button again. Your start-up screen should turn on. There are lots of reasons your screen might be frozen: your software isn't up-to-date, you're downloading something and it has overloaded the system, outside temperature has affected the Kindle, too many apps are running, or the battery is low.
Email won't work. Sometimes the email will work for a short period of time and then stop working, or it won't work at all. Either way, it's really annoying. The best way to deal with this is to work through a free third-party app like K-9 mail or Kaiten mail, or buying an app like Enhanced Mail.Internet connection issues with your Kindle can be immensely irritating since it limits your ability to download books. Check your connection by looking at the top right-hand corner of your screen. Try re-starting your Kindle if your connection is low, as that can help boost the signal. Check your battery as well. Sometimes that can affect your Kindle's internet connection."

Certain files can easily be converted to PDFs depending on what the original file is, such as a .jpg pf .png. However, word documents require a bit more work.


Open the document you wish to convert to a PDF. On a Mac go to the ‘’’File’’’ menu and click on ‘’’Save As’’’ in the drop down menu. You should see a ‘’’Format’’’ section with a drop down menu. Click PDF, then ‘’’Save’’’. If PDF is not an available format, you may need to install a PDF conversion software or use an online converter service.
On a PC, in your word document, click ‘’’File’’’, then ‘’’Save As’’’. Under the “File Types” section you will see a “Create PDF/XPS Document” option. You will then have the option to save the file type as a PDF.
You can also try going to the ‘’’Print’’’ menu in a document or on a webpage to convert or save your file as a PDF. Go to the ‘’’File’’’ menu, click ‘’’Print’’’. Then, in the print menu, you should have the option to save the document as a PDF instead of printing it. Other applications, like photo viewers or editors will give you the option to export your document as a PDF under File, Export as PDF.

On a PC, if you don’t find your Kindle drive on your desktop, you can find it in the ‘’’Computer’’’, ‘’’My Computer folder’’’.

, Right now your Kindle is acting like an external hard drive storing information such as your books, music, and any other files you may have.


Depending on which model you have, you will see a number of different folders and files. You want to locate your ‘’’Documents’’’ folder.

, This will bring you to where all your e-reading material is stored. You may see several folders within this folder and a couple different file types. You don’t need to click on anything once inside your document folder.


The standard file type for a Kindle e-book is either .mobi or .azw, but your Kindle will accept a variety of file types, like PDF.

, Your PDF should be stored on your desktop if you moved it, or in whichever folder you sent it to when you converted the file to PDF, like your ‘’’Documents’’’ folder. Click on the PDF file to select it. Now drag the file into your Kindle Documents folder. The PDF will now automatically sync with your Kindle. Close the ‘’’Documents’’’ folder.


You can also choose to right click on the PDF file and click ‘’’Make a Copy’’’. Then go back to your Kindle’s documents folder, right click inside the folder, and click ‘’’Paste’’’.

, If using a Mac, simply click the Kindle icon and drag it to the trash. If using a PC, click on the ‘’’Safely Remove Hardware’’’ icon, and select ‘’’Eject Amazon Kindle’’’. You may now disconnect the device from your computer.

, Each Kindle unlocks a little differently, so follow the unlocking instructions to get to your home screen. Your recently converted PDF will appear in your documents or books list.

, As you scroll down the page, you will see a list of clans with the board titled ""The Main Game."" Join one of these boards, or select ""Fan Clans, Tribes, and Loner Lands."" Find a thread that has an appealing story and set of characters to you.

, Often, it contains important facts about the plot, as well as additional rules for the roleplay. The owner may require you to sign up for the roleplay on a separate thread, or he may allow you to jump into the story. You will also be expected to create a character in order to participate. Be sure that you meet all the necessary requirements for the roleplay.

, Be sure that you follow the appropriate roleplaying rules. Learn to get along with the other players.

, When you first begin roleplaying, your posts may not be as complex as those who have had more experience. Your sentences may be short and to the point. Although some people may ridicule you for your simple style, never be ashamed of it. As you roleplay more frequently, you will learn to adapt to the different writing styles. The harder you work on writing, the more you will improve until you too can write complicated posts.


As a person new to roleplaying, your writing may sound like this:

Burnshadow awoke and went out of his den to find his leader. His leader told him he needed to make a hunting patrol. Burnshadow went out with Riversky and Bluepaw and hunted in his territory. He came back with a lot of prey and went back to his den to sleep.



, Rather than repeating the same word in your post, use a thesaurus to find descriptive synonyms that add flavor to your writing. Although you should avoid using too many big words, insert semi-advanced vocabulary words into your sentences for a colorful post.

, Rather than simply stating them as they are, add more style and uniqueness to them by including detail. Detail is the key to capturing attention of readers, as it helps draw people into your writing. Although you should refrain from including too much, don't be afraid to lengthen simple actions. For example, if your character woke up and walked out of the den, you could say:


The sunlight pierced through the den. Burnshadow jerked awake with a meow, squinting into the searing rays. He slowly stretched his paws out and winced at the ache from his stiff sleep. Yawning, he rolled his neck before shooting out of his nest in search of his leader.

, Instead of constantly using his name or pronouns, replace it with a short description of him. For example, replace ""Burnshadow"" with ""the rowan-colored tom."" This adds an interesting mix into your post, and it gives your readers an idea of your character's appearance. For example:


The rowan-colored tom padded into the Warrior's den. His eyes darted from nest to nest before focusing on his den-mate Riversky. The black cat was stretched out on his belly, a white paw tucked against his nose. With a soft sigh, Burnshadow padded over to the tom and nudged his head until his eyes blearily opened.

, Showing rather than telling the scenes unfolds a new world for your readers. They will be able to see your characters come to life in front of them. You will also be able to weave your characters' personalities into their words using different tones and speaking habits (ex: A shy cat might speak more hesitantly while a bold cat may have more to say). Although descriptive sentences can be helpful when telling a story, you may need to break up your paragraphs with some dialogue to keep your readers' interest going.


For example, ""Riversky, wake up!"" could be an appropriate substitute for ""Burnshadow asked Riversky to awaken.""
Beware of too much dialogue. Use enough to keep the story flowing, but avoid dumping too much information into conversations. Keep them short and to the point, writing them as naturally as a normal person would speak.

, An emotional character provides the opportunity for readers to bond with him. Without feelings, a story would become uninteresting since people won't be able to empathize with its characters. Describe your character's emotional reaction to major events, but beware of revealing too much at a time. Learn to convey his feelings through his actions as well so that your story continues flowing.


For example, ""A terrible scream shook the den. Fear gripped Burnshadow's heart. He froze in his nest, claws sliding out as his heart leaped into his throat.""

, Delete unnecessary descriptions that distract readers from your story. Learn to be moderate in what you type. Remove extraneous details, and include additional descriptions where it is necessary. Keep your grammar at a top-notch level by using spellcheck or running a careful eye over your posts. Although it may take more time and effort, don't hesitate to stray from simple sentences and lengthen your posts.


Accept criticism. Rather than allowing it to discourage you, take the opportunity to extract as many lessons from it as possible. Learn to improve your posts as time goes on. The more constructive advice you accept, the better your writing will be.

, Read the responses to your character's actions, and reply to them with an additional post. As time continues on, gather as much advice as you can in order to improve your writing. Perhaps one day you'll be able to start your own roleplay.

",How to Roleplay as a Warrior Cat," Currently, there are six different parts to the Warriors Saga. They are Warriors, The New Prophecy, The Power of Three, Omen of the Stars, Dawn of the Clans and A Vision of Shadows. Also, there are Warriors Mangas, and books like ""Firestar's Quest"", ""Cats of the Clans"", ""Bluestar's Prophecy"" and ""Warriors Field guide"". Only the first 6 books (The new prophecy: Into the wild, Fire and ice, Forest of secrets, Rising storm, A dangerous path and The darkest hour.) are essential to start your own role play though, so at least read those to get a basic understanding of the Warriors life.;
, There should be at least four clans in the forest. Choose names for your clans like MistClan, ForestClan, DarkClan, RippleClan, SpeedClan or LightClan. Don't choose names like EgyptianClan or BookClan.

, Think of your roleplay name first, and then think of your leader's, deputy's, and others.

, Include things like Fourtrees, Twolegplace, or Treecutplace. You could also make specific landmarks such as Sunningrocks, Moonpool, Highrocks, and other things the cats would call something.

, Enlist a friend, tell them to read the books, give them a name, age, and status, and explain to them their territory, landmarks, and any other important things.

, It is good to start off as a kit or apprentice so you can have experience through playing the game. If you are an apprentice, pick your mentor, and then go on training missions.

,, You should go outside and ""hunt"" then coming back in and drop something on your honorary ""fresh-kill pile"" and eat something, referring to it as fresh-kill.

, You can roleplay outside if it's warm, or roleplay inside if it's cold. Get a box or a large pile of rocks and declare it as your highrocks. Set up tents, or some other form of make-shift shelter and declare those as your dens. Lastly, make a fresh-kill pile (This can be a large plate or aluminum foil) and set food on it.

, Make people think you're just crazy as you go through these.

Many role plays construct their characters differently, but your Warrior Cat's profile should include the following:


Name
Age
Gender
Appearance
Personality
Clan;
,
When constructing your cat's profile, refrain from using one of the names from the Warrior Cats series.,
Avoid Mary Sues.",How to Roleplay a Warrior Cat Online1,", The fun grows when you create your own name! This rule also applies to your cat's personality and appearance. Avoid building your cat off one of the original Warrior Cats and from other people's characters. Be creative and original!

, A Mary Sue is a character that is completely perfect. They are super strong, nice, smart, skilled, and beautiful. They never lose or get angry, and they usually have bad pasts. To avoid Mary Sues, think about your cat. If it is small, they can be fast and smart, but they will most likely be weak. Make your characters a little dumb, or maybe a little mean. But remember that every cat has to have some flaws.

"
"
Ask your friends if they are interested in making a clan.,
If someone is new to the world of Warriors, tell them the key things about the books.,

Decide on the ranks.,

Name your characters.,
Tell all your friends about your character.,
Choose a habitat for your clan.,
Begin roleplay!",How to Make a Warrior Cats Clan with Your Friends," If one of your friends says no, ask if they want to be a rogue, loner, kittypet or even another animal (like a badger or a fox). This can be fun since not every cat is a warrior, but if they still refuse, don't force them to play.;
, Make sure they know about the clans, the Warrior Code, ranks, and traditions. When assigning a rank for that person, suggest them starting off as a kit or apprentice since they don't know much.

,

Every clan needs a leader - this must be an experienced reader (whoever has read the most books or gained the most knowledge) and somebody that will be a good roleplayer.
Next, the leader needs to choose a deputy. The deputy should have read at least a series of books. The leader should test a few willing people and then choose somebody reliable. If your clan is evil, the leader should make sure the deputy is evil unless the leader isn't actually evil and they want their clan to to be good.
The medicine cat should be a sympathetic, kind and sweet person that doesn't fight much and is quite clever. They don't actually need to know about herbs, but suggest them searching up different plants and how they can be used.
Warriors are very important so you should have at least three of them.
Apprentices need good mentors, preferably ones that have been warriors/medicine cat for a while.
Kits should be people that are quite cute, cheeky or don't know much about warriors. If you have kits, make sure you have queens.
It is also fun to have elders. Storytellers made wonderful elders.
However, in the case that you don't have many members, suggest each person having more than one character. Playing the same role in a small group becomes boring fast. Also, make sure an apprentice receives their warrior name - don't stick with the same rank.

, Names are very important. Your members must have warrior names unless they were formerly a loner/rogue/kittypet. Names for kits must end in -kit. Apprentice names end in -paw. If your cat has a certain interesting feature, like a disfigurement, you can add that into the name. Medicine cat names/warrior names usually end in body parts, but it is more creative to think of suffixes other than -pelt, -fur, -leg, etc. Be aware that medicine cat names don't usually end in claw, because medicine cats rarely fight. Deputies keep their warrior names unless they become leader, in which they take -star as their leader name ending. Elders keep their warrior names unless something has changed about them. For example, if a cat named Maplefoot had twisted her paw, she may change her name to Twistedleg. These names can be interesting, and describe your character well, but normal names are nice too.

Make sure all names are natural. Unless they are kittypets (house cats), you would hardly find a cat named Mustangpaw, or a silly name like Awesomepaw, Cocopaw, or Phonepaw! That is why it is vital to have a nature-related names. For ideas, imagine things you would see out in nature - TVs and cars aren't one of them. Instead, think of plants, animals, clouds and water, among others. Do not create mean names, or somebody can get hurt, refuse to join, or tell on you as bullies, which you don't want to be.

, They don't have to know everything, but make sure they know their personality, their aims in life, etc. Make sure they also know what your cat looks like. Pretend that they are blind and describe your cat to the best of your ability. (For example, you don't want your friends to think that a cat named Blackpelt has white fur.)

, No matter where you're roleplaying, know that you can choose anywhere for your clan to live. You may be playing in your school playground, but your clan may whisk you away to a beautiful tropical island. Territories usually have landmarks, and they always have a place for apprentices to train and a camp. There is often a dangerous area in one place in the territory, such as Snakerocks in Thunderclan's forest territory. If you want, help draw a map of the territory with your friends, showing where everywhere is. This can help you be descriptive during your roleplay.

, Always accept new members."
"
Don't spotlight.,
Avoid power playing other people's characters; in other words, don't control them!,
Read the Warrior Cats series to get a basic understanding of how their world works.,
Your cat should act according to how the Warrior Cats normally act in the books.",How to Roleplay a Warrior Cat Online2," This means to make your character the center of attention. Try to include yourself, but don't make your character annoyingly involved. Try making more than one character, and have them take turns being involved in important events. Give others a chance to shine!

, People dislike it, and it removes all the fun and freedom from the roleplay. Only powerplay someone else's character(s) if they ask you to.

, If you go into a roleplay and have no idea what you're doing, chances are that people will grow annoyed.

, Perhaps you can be a little imaginative and tweak it a little, but don't go as far as to adding portals or non-existent monsters that cannot be found in the original Warrior Cats books.

"
"
First, decide on your cat's personality.,
What is your cat's physical appearance?,
Think about your cat's abilities and habits.,
Look at your cat's history.,
Look at a few different warrior books, and find two parts of a warrior name that haven't been used yet.,
Remember that the first part of your cat's name usually stays the same throughout its life.

,
Know that the first part of a warrior name almost always starts out with something in nature.,
Have the last part of a warrior name fit with the first part.,
Take your cat's appearance into account when naming him/her.,
Consider your cat's personal details.,
Realize that your name doesn't have to be a combination of those names.,
Remember that when naming, they won't know the full character right away.,
Do not use certain words in your warrior's name.",How to Make a Warrior Cat Name," If your cat is silly and playful, you may want a name like Squirrelleaf. But if your cat is a noble warrior, you'd probably look for something more epic, like Lionheart, or Fireheart. Please note that prefixes (the Lion- in Lionheart) don't usually determine a personality, suffixes (the -heart in Lionheart) show traits like that.;
, If they have unusual patterns or striking colors, go ahead and name them something like Flameclaw or Leopardpelt.

, If your cat loves to swim, for example, you could name them Graysplash.

, If they were always lovestruck, you could name them Larksong or Goldenheart.

, If you like them, combine them! Examples:


Ambertail. She-cat. Warrior. ThunderClan. Dappled tortie with white paws and dark amber eyes. Bright and sweet, a good hunter and kind. Wants kits of her own. Adores her leader.
Bluefang . She-cat. Warrior. RiverClan. Bluish she-cat with amber eyes. A stern and uptight warrior, is hard to find kindness in her.
Aspenfur. Tom. Warrior. ThunderClan. Gray tom with green eyes, was trained under Sandstorm. A quick and fast warrior, the fastest since Runningwind.
Shadetail. Deputy. Tom. Windclan. A black cat, has pale green eyes. Was once a maltreated kit during the regime of Brokenstar, was left to die in the woods during leaf-bare when he couldn't keep up with a raiding party, but found his way to WindClan when they were driven out by ShadowClan. Has never trusted the cruel, hostile Clan of RiverClan. Is a natural leader though, but does his best to be modest. Is good friends with Dustpelt and Longtail, who are like him.

,, Colors, types of trees or flowers or nature, animals, types of weather, etc. The name must never include ""Star,"" ""Spirit,"" or ""Moon.""


Moonflower was a mistake on Erin Hunter's part, and she has admitted to it. ""Star"" is the end of the leader, and it wouldn't be good if there was a ""Starstar,"" now would it? ""Moon"" cannot be used as it is religious, and a large part of the Clan's lives.
Moonstone, Moonhigh, Fullmoon, there are many uses. ""Spirit"" is also religious and therefore forbidden. It is also forbidden to use the clan names for other Warriors; Thunder, Wind, Shadow and River. Erin Hunter has stated these themselves.
(Examples: Lily, Flower, Pine, Oak, Willow, Rose, Flame, Stone, Fox, Mouse, Dove, Hawk, Lark)

, For instance, if his/her first name is Leopard, you may use Leopardfur or Leopardclaw. If it was Hawk, maybe Hawkflight or Hawktail (Ex: claw, fur, pelt, storm, tail) If your cat has a color, plant, or other thing as the first part, things can be more flexible.

, You wouldn't want to name a sweet golden she-cat Darkpelt or Shadeclaw. You're better off naming her Goldfur or Dawnpelt.

, If your cat is black or a dark color, don't give it a name like Cloudfur. Stormcloud or Ravenfeather would probably be better. Give your cat a name that describes him/her in the best way possible.

, Does your cat have something characteristic about him/herself? For instance Runningnose, from Erin Hunter's books, was named for his 'running nose' because he always seemed to have a cold.

, You should not name it based on the personality, eye color, or even the full coloring of that cat when it is named. However, you could have the queen wait a few days before naming the kits. ""Eye"" is a very uncommon name, and most people refrain from using it (Blue eye is an example, but some use it for an elder as Blue-Eye. It is usually not used because of the ""e"" in the beginning and also there is usually a vowel in the last two letters of the prefix (usually ""e"", but it can be an ""a""). If you do insist on having the ""eye"" suffix, Swan eye (A beautiful white she-cat with a black patch on her head that covers her baby blue eyes), Fox eye (A ginger tom with scars over his jade-green eyes, but does not harm his sight. He has black paws and a white underbelly), and Brown eye (Extremely matted grey tom with white paws, black underbelly and brown eyes) are a couple of suggestions.


Most cats don't have an obvious personality right away. The eye color for cats is always hidden for a while as their eyes are closed, and even when their eyes are open, they are blue and then fade into the final color.
Also many cats, like tabby cats, don't show their markings right away. Don't name a nice golden she-cat sweet; you might not know they are nice until after naming them. Even the Warriors books have made this mistake.

, For instance, Dragon, Drake, Super, Power, Vampire, God/Goddess names. Anything mystical or make-believe should not be in a Warrior's name, as it doesn't exist in the Warrior cat world and therefore doesn't make sense.

Get a blank notebook.,
Write ""Warrior Cat Notebook"" or ""Warrior Cat Journal"" neatly on the front cover.,
Come up with three to five Clans.,
Name your Clans.,
Try to come up with some territory that matches the Clan name.,
Draw out what the Clan camp looks like - where's the entrance, where is the nursery?,
Write the title of the Clan you just created on the next page.,
Create a map for where all the Clans live.,
Make some ""outsiders"".,
Skip a couple pages and start writing a ""diary"" for the Clans.,
Make a list of all the cures of diseases, if you have any.",How to Make a Warrior Cat Journal," If you have a used one, remove the pages already written on. Try to make the book unique so that you can identify it if you don't label it.;
, However, if you are shy and don't want others to see, just don't label the book.


Write the warrior code inside the front cover if you want.

, Make as many Clans as you want - just don't make it too confusing!

, Come up with some names from nature - FireClan, SwiftClan, TreeClan, MarshClan, and WaterClan, or whatever you want.

, For example, AdderClan for a Clan that frequents a sandy, dusty area with lots of snakes. But you don't always have to, because these Clans are what you are making, and they will be your unique one.

, Make sure to set up the Clan camp strategically. If you don't, the Clan could easily be taken over. For example, if the nursery and elder's den was right beside the entrance to the camp, the kits could be taken away and the elders would be injured first. These two positions of the Clan are to be treated with respect, and making them bait is not honorable.

, Write down its history. How was it created? Who was it made by? Make a summary of this Clan. What does their territory look like? How do they hunt? What color are their pelts normally? You might also want to write down the current leaders and cats in the Clan, like the deputy, warriors, apprentices, queens, kits, leaders, and medicine cat. If you want, make a Clan symbol for the Clans, too!

, Where are the Clans located? Are they near the ocean, or in the deep jungle? Where are the boundaries? Question yourself on these matters, and you will probably make a good section of the biome good Clan territory!


Try to make a Gathering place, preferably in the center of all the Clan territories. Make a special mark to mark that specific spot, and a place for the leaders and deputies to sit.
Make a place where the medicine cats can communicate with StarClan every half moon- they need the guidance for their Clans. Try to make it mysterious, like when the medicine cats pick a plant, the fragrance makes them fall asleep.

, You can have loners, rogues, kittypets, Twolegs, and more. Make a Twoleg place - the Clans can have some adventures with them and their kittypets.

, To do this, you might want to make a group of your own at your school or social media. Talk about the Clans, and write this down for the diary. You don't have to do it for all the Clans - just one would be good enough. For the dates, write the following or make your own style:


For an ordinary day: If it were January 2, 2015, the date in the diary would be: First moon, leaf-bare (2015) Second day.
For a special occasion: If it were half moon and it was time for the medicine cats to go communicate with StarClan, the actual date would look somewhat like this: February 14, 2015. For the Clan style, it would be: Half moon, second moon. (medicine cats' name/s) went to (StarClan meeting place), leaf-bare (2015).
If you are doing this for all the Clans, put: First moon, leaf-bare (2015) Second day for WhiteClan.

Here's an example of an entry: Tenth moon, leaf-fall (2015). Tenth day. (Put your Clan name here) (next line) Today hunting was well. The leaves are beginning to fall. Snowpaw had a thorn in her paw-at least she's patient!



, If you are going to make up some medicines and diseases, make sure to pair them up properly so that you don't end up with a cough that can't be cured!

Try not to choose an unrealistic name, or a man-made name. For example, CookieClan, SteelClan, TVClan, anything like that. KitClan, WarriorClan, DeputyClan, CatClan or anything like that is considered bad and are highly discouraged.
, These could be your friends, the kids in the corner, the ones with their noses in the books that you think need some active time or some friends... Practically anyone! Ask them to join your Clan, and if they say yes, you're all set once you get enough!, Choose the most responsible person to be leader or have an election for leader. The Deputy is chosen before or at Moonhigh(So, before nightfall) and is responsible for patrols and such. Somebody could volunteer to be Medicine Cat, or, if multiple apply, there could be an election, or have the Leader choose. The rest will decide to be either Warriors, Apprentices, Queens, Kits, or Elders., If you're feeling up for the challenge, write a list of prefixes(Rock-, Shadow-, Willow-) and a list of suffixes(-pelt, -claw, -fur). Say, we have a kit that just joined, and they are named Jaykit. -Kit's their suffix because they are a kit. Then, when Jaykit is apprenticed, she becomes Jaypaw, suffixed -paw for being an apprentice. When she becomes a warrior, the whole Clan shouts out ""JayFROST!"" Because her new suffix is now, -frost. When she becomes leader, she earns the name JaySTAR for being chosen by StarClan., This includes landmarks, special training areas, hunting spots, etc. You can also create some other Clans, for others to join and lead(maybe, StormClan and FrostClan are neighbors.), The world of Warriors has never been peaceful and it will never be. You could declare wars on either another Clan that another group made or an imaginary Clan. You could either do it as play-fighting or talk-fighting.

Play-fighting would be just gently wrestling and pretend scratching.
Talk fighting is simply saying what you're doing, like ""Rocktail backed against the tree and got ready to spring on Nightstrike. He charged towards the black tom and pounced onto him."" ""Nightstrike rolled to the side, thus dodging Rocktail's attack. He pounced onto Rocktail, attempting to pin him.""
Look out for powerplaying, which is controlling the other's character and is considered cheating by many. An example is ""Falconshade saw Whitestar give the signal. He charged down the slope with the sun behind him and pounced onto Sleekfoot. He raked Sleekfoot with his claws and killed him."" Here Sleekfoot's player doesn't have any say about if he could've dodged or not.
Use stuffed toys if you don't have another Clan near you. As an alternative you could allow people to double as enemy cats.

"
Ask yourself these questions: What is the basic territory?,
Now that you have the most basic of territory, get specific.,
Now describe why all of these places are dangerous, filled with prey, apprentices are trained there.,
Now that you have the basic territory filled out, draw a picture of it, and DON'T include the camp in your drawing.,
Now that you have placed your camp, it is time to place the dens, the fresh-kill pile, the high rock, and anything else you want to add in your camp.",How to Make a Descriptive Warrior Cats Territory," What do the Clan cats look like? What is the Clan called? What do they hunt? You want to make sure that they all fit together.;
, You should have all of these questions answered:


Where do your cats hunt?
Where do apprentices train?
Where are all the herbs found?
Where have battles been fought?
Are there any dangerous areas?
Where is bedding found?
Where do they hunt? (include great hunting spots, lesser hunting spots, and places where prey is slightly scarce)

, This isn't difficult. Prey usually stays near food. You can say prey is there because there are fruits, nuts, berries, herbs, etc. You can say badgers are attracted to the nice dens, that snakes stay in the rocks, that there is quicksand, or that the rocks are slippery and a cat could fall.

, Once you have the drawing, look at it. Figure out where you might decide to make your camp if you lived there.


Pick somewhere that isn't too near a river, a dangerous area, or somewhere prey is abundant. If they stayed near water, there would be floods. If they stayed near a dangerous area, kits would sneak out and get hurt less than a fox-length out of camp. If they were too close to prey, the prey would be scared away.

, You should add a leader's den, a medicine den, a warriors' den, an apprentices' den, and elders' den, and a nursery.

"
"
Develop the cat's appearance.,
Break down the description components.,
Make up a name for your cat based on what you know about the cat.,
Find or draw a picture of your cat.",How to Create a Warrior Cats OC (Original Character)1," Describe it in as much detail as possible. Avoid being too brief with the description. For example, saying ""large pure black tom with amber eyes"" is too simplistic. Instead, describe your warrior cat as: ""Pure black tom with dark amber eyes, the exact shade of fire. His glossy fur is long, and he sheds frequently. His tail is shorter than average and seems twice as thick due to his long, flowing fur. He is stocky and thick compared to his height, though he is taller than the average tom.""


Choose only natural fur and eye colors, no purple, pink, green, yellow, or straight orange, red and blues on cats. If you want to have a 'blue' cat, make sure they are a dark silver or pale gray, maybe even a blue-gray like Bluestar, and red cats should be either orange, ginger, red-brown, or even a mixture of browns and ginger. Orange fur is usually a lighter ginger colors. The cat's eyes should either be blue, gray, yellow, amber, green, you could also look up natural eye colors for cats to see what possibilities there are.;
, When describing your cat you need to include the name (see next step), fur color, gender, eye color, clan, personality, and any kits or mates. For example:


Rosestar: Cream colored she-cat with blue-green eyes. Very stubborn but loyal. No kits or mate.
Silverthorn: Silver gray she-cat with amber eyes. Mysterious and loyal. Has a kit called Yewkit. Nobody knows her mate.
Lightningtail: golden-yellow tom with a white stripe across its body, a zig-zagged tail, and gold eyes. Brave and very kind. Mate is Icepool. No kits.
Owlpaw: brown and white tom with green eyes. Clever and brave. No kits or mate.

, Think through the cat's likely life story when coming up with a name. Imagine your (male) cat as a kit, his eyes still closed. You are his mother and you must name him. For example, ""Nightkit. He is large and dark, like the night sky, and the moon is occasionally orange, and its eyes would look like moons in the night sky."" Then, zoom to his warrior ceremony. He is a young cat, Nightpaw. Take into consideration his pelt color, length, his eye color, his personality, size, and everything about him. Nightnose wouldn't make sense because there is nothing special about his nose or sense of smell. But Nighttail, Nightfur, Nightheart, and Nightshadow are good ideas. Nighttail because of his bushy tail. Nightfur because of his fuzzy pelt. Nightshadow because he is very dark black. And Nightheart because he is brave and tough, but kind-hearted.


Warrior cat names must be based on nature and must be things that cats know about or come into contact with. Thus, names like 'Dragonfang' and 'Princesspaw' or 'Marshmallow Nose' are not allowed because these aren't things cats are familiar with. Common pet names are not allowed unless the cat is a former kittypet.
Warrior cat names come in two parts. The first part stays constant throughout life, and the second part changes based on rank. Cats younger than six moons (months) have the suffix 'kit'. Cats older than that are apprentices and have 'paw'. After they become warriors, they get a warrior name. If they happen to become leader after that, the suffix changes to 'star'. For example: Amberkit, Amberpaw, Amber gaze, Amberstar.

, It doesn't have to be too detailed if you draw it. Just get your point across!

Develop your warrior cat's personality.,
Consider your cat's other personality traits, likes, and dislikes, etc.,

Give your cat a special talent, or lack of talent.,

Write a short story using your cat to get the feel of playing or writing in this cat's character.,
Add the cat's family.",How to Create a Warrior Cats OC (Original Character)2," Take into consideration the cat's size; large cats will be tough, but somewhat clumsy, while long-legged cats will be swift, big-eared cats will be able to hear well. Also, include some skills of theirs. For example, you might not want ""tough but kind"", but instead want, ""He is tough in battle, and wary of enemy clans, but he is kind to his clan-mates. He is gentle with kits and is protective over his mate. He is brave, but not the smartest cat. He would take on a fox or even a badger before thinking if it's really a good idea or not."" See the difference?

, The following list details some things to consider here:


What is your cat's favorite food (plump squirrel)?
What is your cat's favorite time of day (dawn, because it is cool)?
What is your cat's biggest fear (having his mate get an incurable disease). Think of ""what if their biggest fear came true?"".
What is your cat's biggest dream? Answer the question ""what if their greatest dream came true?"".
How would your cat react if lost and in enemy territory?
What would your cat do it if met a kittypet in your own cat's territory?(scare off the kittypet)
What if your warrior cat became a medicine cat? Or, vice versa?
A good method is to keep asking yourself ""Why?"" to every question you think of. Keep doing this until you get back down to their backstory. Tie it in.


Make your choices for this cat realistic. Remember the cat's personality, size, and looks. Most of all, avoid making a Mary-Sue cat (an all too perfect cat). Don't use the same descriptive words too often––be adventurous in describing your warrior cat.







, Use the cat's personality as a basis for this aspect. For example: Is your cat mean and ruthless or kind and gentle? Motherly? Cold and cruel or honest and loyal?

, Readers are usually more interested in a story with a struggle, so special talents could hold you back, but try to make it work. Something along the lines of a great fighter, super smart medicine cat, or amazing hunter are usually popular and easy to work with but can be way overused.


If you want to add disability, be careful. It's important to consider that people who read your story may have that disability or know someone who does, so be considerate. Think about how the community supports the cat, and what strengths the cat has (so that they don't exist purely as a burden).
It is not a good idea to give cats powers. It works sometimes, but most of the time it makes things seem very unlikely.

, Your history should be detailed and a bit lengthy. Include past clans, past battles, and any important events.

,


Example: Silverthorn yawned as the first signs of dawn stretched across the sky. It was another day, and Silverthorn had to do the dawn patrol. She was tired and didn't want to, but she had to do what was best for her Clan.

, Add how their family changes their personality, looks, or anything else about the cat. Make each family member, clan-mate, rogue, or whoever, using the same method as above.

, So draw a cat or design one online, then figure out what type of cat you want like a tabby or maybe a calico something like that. Then figure out if you want to be elder, leader, warrior, medicine cat, queen, apprentice, or kit. Try being a leader if you want.

If you're a kit, it should be something like: BlackKit, MintKit, or FireKit. Say those three became Apprentices they would go from kit to paw like this: BlackPaw, MintPaw, and FirePaw. Then they became warriors from paw to something else like the first part of their name then what there first part of they're represents like: BlackClaw, MintLeaf, and FirePelt. Then say they became leader, it would change from they're last part of they're name to star like this: BlackStar, MintStar, and FireStar.

Figure out how the cat learned about the prophecy.,
Determine the cat or cats to whom the prophecy relates.,
Determine the underlying meaning.,
Word the prophecy.,
Note that prophecies in Warriors do not rhyme and do not sound like a poem.,
Determine how the prophecy can be fulfilled.,
Figure out how the prophecy will be shown to the cat you've figured out must receive it.",How to Create a Warrior Cat Prophecy," How did your cat find out about about the prophecy? Did he/she see it in a dream, go to the Moonstone/Moonpool and share tongues with StarClan, receive an omen, or (if they are a leader) see it at their nine lives ceremony?
, Who are the cats mentioned in the prophecy? Which cat or cats must receive the prophecy? Also determine the cat or cats who give the prophecy. This will usually be a StarClan cat, one whom was important to the cat(s) in question., Every prophecy needs a main message or meaning. For example, in the books, the prophecy ""Fire alone will save the Clan."" (Erin Hunter), serves a great purpose. Say there's a cat named Rosethorn, and she is destined to save the forest. This is a useful example to follow through with., Just saying that Rosethorn will save the forest is dull and lacks emphasis. Make is seem more mysterious and cryptic. Maybe you could try something like: ""The flower will bloom, and become the light that shines from the stars and break through the darkness of shade"".

Do not make the prophecy obvious. Include twists that are not immediately apparent to the reader or the cat.

, They will include hints about their meaning but will be vague and open to interpretation. They are also usually highly symbolic. For example, if the characters are Icetalon and Whitefire, don't say ""The ice will beat the white"", instead, say something like: ""Frozen talons may be strong enough to rip apart the white destruction."", How will the cat fulfill the prophecy? Do they need to find, rescue or kill another cat? Locate the Clans safely across unknown paths? Do they need to die themselves? Maybe go against the forces of nature? Or maybe even go against the warrior code and abandon their clans?, Say that Rosethorn gets this prophecy. She could be told by her mother who died and went to StarClan."

Keep the name neutral however - don't use words that cat's don't know, like ""plastic"". Something that is related to where they live would be good (such as Pinefur). Or you can use a name based on an animal, (Crowcall) their appearance, (Palepelt) or their personality (Flameheart).;
, Name it something natural - names like MetalClan are not natural. Try something like TreeClan or BreezeClan, or you can use one of the original clan names: ThunderClan, RiverClan, ShadowClan, WindClan, or SkyClan. Make sure the clan name makes sense too, and that it matches the warriors in the clan personality.

, Make sure you name your clan so that the other clans know which clan you are. Just put a name then the suffix -clan (Example: FireClan). Also make sure that when you name your clan you name it based off of your territory or clan specialty.

, Find a few apprentices, warriors, kits, a medicine cat, deputy, and leader if you aren't. You can talk about your new clan when your friends are around. They may want to join your clan if it seems fun enough. Have some friends be apprentices, some warriors, one the deputy, and one the medicine cat. Elders and queens aren't really necessary since they don't do much in a clan often.


If they don't know about warriors that much, make them apprentices. If you have too many apprentices, make young ones kits, and the ones who know more about the warrior cat series Warriors, deputy, or medicine cat.

, If you don't have enough players, substitute with plush cats. They'll work, as long as you have 2-3 warriors and apprentices, a deputy, medicine cat. Make sure to have a fresh-kill pile for them! Use other items for pretend fresh kill.

, The kitchen can have the fresh kill pile, the bathroom can be the dirtplace, etc.

, Your house is the territory. Make a pile of things and cover it with a large blanket. Try using blue construction paper and put it near your door to make it look like water. A nice cardboard tree will help, too. You can use stickers on your walls to make your room seem more natural.

, The Highrock is where the leader stands, and in the inside is the leader's den. Make it out of soft, comfortable things such as pillows. Stack a few pillows then put a blanket straight and put something strong then a pillow or two then another blanket on top of the pillows.

, Make sure to hide it so if your camp gets attacked the kits and queens are safe and, make it out of strong pillows so if anyone aged six and under is inside if it falls, it won't fall and hurt them.

, Make it with strong pillows, and make your own herbs with food you can eat.

, Make it out of strong pillows, and put folded blankets as the nests.

Join a fanfiction site.",How to Become a Warrior Cats Fan," This is important, if you want to become a true Warrior Cats fan. There are seven series, each with six books-with the exception of the newest series, A Vision of Shadows, which only has three books because it is incomplete. You can buy the books of each series altogether in boxed sets, or buy them all together. A list of each of the seven main series follows below. You can look on the official Warriors website for a list of all of the books within the series, but the very first book in the series is Into the Wild. It will take a while if you want to read them all, so be patient. There are a lot of books.

The series:

The Prophecies Begin
The New Prophecy
Power of Three
Omen of the Stars
A Vision of Shadows
Dawn of the Clans (Prequel)

;
, These books are biographies about some of the cat's lives, uncovering details about their past. After you have read all of the main books, you don't necessarily have to read these, but they are still interesting. Here are all of them:

Yellowfang's Secret
Tallstar's Revenge
Bluestar's Prophecy
Crookedstar's Promise
Firestar's Quest
SkyClan's Destiny
Moth Flight's Vision
Bramblestar's Storm
Hawkwing's Journey

, These can help give you a better understanding of the Warriors world. They're also good to have around as reference, in case you forgot little details. These are all the books:

Secrets of the Clans
Battles of the Clans
Cats of the Clans
Enter the Clans
Code of the Clans
The Ultimate Field Guide

, Reading these are totally optional, but you may still want to, so that you can brag about how you've read every single book. There are mangas, ebooks, and novellas. The mangas are just books written in a comic book-like style, telling extra stories like Scourge's childhood, and about Tigerstar meeting a kittypet. The novellas are shorter stories about Warriors, and ebooks are books that can be downloaded to your tablet or E reader., Do you want to join a site to create your own cat, and roleplay with others? Maybe you want to write your own stories, and read other's? Before you spread the fandom online, you need to first decide what you want from a website., There are many to choose from online, so be sure to do some browsing for the perfect one.

When you join an RP, you need to create a Warrior Cats OC, or original character. We have many articles on that topic on wikiHow, as well as how to roleplay as a Warrior.

, The most popular one by far is Fanfiction.net, but there are others.

You can do more than just read other's stories. Don't be afraid to write your own fanfic, you might find that you love the hobby, and that other people love your writing.
Remember to always give credit to Erin Hunter for writing the original stories.
You can also use your roleplay OC for your stories and ideas. Just don't use anyone else's cats without their permission.

Create your clan.,
Maintain your clan in the early stages.,
Add another clan.,
Defend the borders.,
Do the hunting.,
Choose the medicine cat.,
Stop your clan from deteriorating.",How to Create and Maintain a Warrior Cats Clan at School," A good time to start a clan, is when you are bored. Then people will be more open to the idea.


Start with just a few friends at first. Give yourselves warrior names, before you start adding ""kit"" or ""star"" to the end of them.
Choose who will be leader, deputy first. The leader should be the person who knows the series best. Add star to the end of their warrior name. Then they must chose a deputy.
Don't bother with a medicine cat yet. Next, you need to choose a name for your clan. You can use a clan from the books, or invent you own. At school, the first thing you need to do, is decide on where the camp will be. It does not need individual dens, just a place for a medicine cat to mix herbs, and a place for the leader to address your clan.
Place the borders. It is not a good idea to include the entire school field in your borders, as you will want to add another clan later.;
, At first your clan will be small. Don't worry though. As you continue to play, interest will grow. when someone first joins, make them an apprentice the first break they play.


Give them a mentor. In that break, their mentor should tell them where the borders are, teach them to hunt and fight, (covered below) and tell them the basic rules of the warrior code. Then, you should make them a warrior.

, When your clan is of substantial size, ask your clan if anyone would like to be leader of another clan. If so, see if any people would like to be part of that other clan. If at least five people want to, then set up another clan, and choose the starting borders.

, To fight, you want to come up with a rock paper scissors type system


Consider these simple examples:

Bellyrake beats frontal paw blow
Frontal paw blow beats roll-and-kick
Roll-and-kick beats bellyrake


If someone loses the ""rock paper scissors"" they have sustained a battle wound. If someone sustains three battle wounds, they must stop fighting. The fight goes on until all of one clan have stopped fighting.
Do not defend your borders from teachers or pupils who are not part of a clan. Only defend them from people in the other clan.

,


Have one person in your clan pretend to be prey. They should run, and when the hunting patrol catch them, they have caught they prey. Make sure people take fair turns at being the prey or arguments could happen.

, If you know someone who likes mushing up berries they find in the school grounds, ask them if they would like to be the medicine cat. If a person sustains a battle wound, the medicine cat can heal them, by naming the right herb, and pretending to mix a poultice.

, There are many ways for a clan to deteriorate, and sometimes it is impossible to stop.


Maybe there has been an argument and clan mates do not want to be near each other. One way of sorting this could be for one person to join the other clan. (Be careful if you suggest this, or you could cause offence and start another argument.
Another reason for the clan breaking up, could be simply because you have been away on summer holiday, and people have forgotten about it. One way of preventing this, is to now and again, remind them of it during the holiday. For example, on a postcard you could put: Loving it here, but I am looking forward to hunting with the clan again.

Although hunting is typically a warrior duty, you are allowed to hunt once in a while to take a break from your medicine duties.

",How to Act Like a Medicine Cat from Warrior Cats," To be a medicine cat you will need knowledge on herbs and how they work. You will also need a pretty strong connection with Starclan.;
, Stick to the warrior code, and make up prophecies to tell to friends and have people fulfill.

, You have to know ALL of them, even the poisons that can kill you and the ones not used for cats or not generally used frequently. The main herbs are feverfew, for fever; marigold, for infection; poppy seeds for pain; catmint, for greencough; tansy, for coughs; and cobwebs, for bleeding.

,,, Be sure you don't lose them. Stow them in a box outside. When you are out in the yard and it's not raining, open it to let the air come in.

, You can still hang out with friends though, because even medicine cats have fun once in a while.

, Be as busy as you can, and rush around the house often searching for a ""certain herb that looks like parsley.""

, You have to do lots of things being a medicine cat, and those are supposed to take up the bored time you have and make your life busier.

, Being a medicine cat, you will have to set a time each month, if possible at night, to go to a certain pond, maybe lake, or a puddle, and if you aren't able to do that, a set place. Another idea is to make a Moonstone, which would be easier to find.

, Find someone interested in herbs, and let them be trained by you.

,,, You can use catspeak, but don't fight or seem a bit too close to it, because medicine cats never fight unless they have to (which means only if they are fighting a badger or fox).

If you assigned apprentices, eventually, they will become warriors.,
Attend gatherings.,
Do what your cat does.,
Spend a lot of time outdoors.",How to Act Like a Warrior Cat," Your cat can be blue (like Bluestar), Tortoiseshell (like Spottedleaf), or even just white with black paws (like Blackstar). Your coat can look like anything! Remember your cat's pelt color, eye color, any markings (such as tabby or calico), and his or her battle scars. Examples are:


Dapplefur- dappled tortie with a white muzzle and amber eyes.
Blueflower- blue-gray with a nick in her ear and green eyes.
Snowstorm- white with yellow eyes and feathered ears.;
, Your eyes can be blue, green, orange, amber, yellow or even violet! But also make reasons why this particular cat has 'unique' pelt colors or weird eye colors. Try to be realistic!

, Shy? Rude? Bossy? Remember, try to avoid a Mary-Sue! (That means don't make your cat perfect. It will impact the story negatively.)

, For example, Nightflower was born to Jayfrost and Willowtail in a bitter leaf-bare. Jayfrost died soon after her birth. As an apprentice, she excelled at hunting and was an ace in speed and agility. She became a warrior at an unusually young age, and so forth.

, You can be WindClan, RiverClan, ShadowClan, ThunderClan, SkyClan, BloodClan, or even StarClan. Or you can try to make a clan like SunClan, BoneClan, FrostClan, etc. But you may choose whatever you like!

, You can be a kit, apprentice, warrior, elder, queen, medicine cat, deputy, or leader. Maybe even a rogue, loner, or kittypet!

, You can make your name based on your rank, or you can make a random warrior name like Back scratch or something like that. You can go on warriorcats.com and type in your name and hometown to get an individual name, or you can try The Erin Hunter way, by having one list of the first part of a name (Jay, Bark, Spotted,etc.), and one with the second half (paw, claw, feather, etc.). Don't make unrealistic names; like Electricbook or simply strange ones like Fireflame. Keep it realistic, that's what makes a good clan cat!

, Stick to nature, but don't call your Clan NatureClan. Also, names like CookieClan, NetflixClan and WiiClan aren't good, because cats don't know what Netflix is. Names like DawnClan, IceClan, FireClan, and SunClan are just a few ideal ones.

, It can be anything, although it should relate to your clan's name and/or abilities. The territory for DustClan, for example, can be dusty and desert-like with dust storms. OakClan territory can be dense forest and undergrowth.

, Make up a leader first, followed by a medicine cat and five to ten warriors. When you start to get comfortable, make apprentices and elders. Queens and kits are a good idea, but they're optional. Finally, choose a loyal and dedicated warrior to be the deputy.


If playing with friends, let them develop their own characters as wished. If there is a struggle over who is leader, etc., throw a coin for it, or take turns at different stages of your games.

, You must have a full clan to have things like meetings, patrols, training, etc. But you could also gather friends from different clans, so you can battle and have gatherings. This is probably the most important part of being a warrior, because the warrior code is for all four of the clans, which you must follow.


To make it even more fun, ask a couple of friends to join your clan and assign apprentices to any warriors. You could show them hunting or battle skills!

, Have a warrior ceremony for them to make it even more realistic!


If there is more than one clan you are dealing with, have a battle sometimes. It would show, if you taught an apprentice battle moves, how well they are coming along with their training!

, You will be able to feed information to another cat or get information from leaders. Remember, don't spill too much.

, This doesn't mean you have to walk around on all fours but behave a bit catlike. Climb trees, eat lots of meat, ""hunt"", and, if you want, have a signature scent with your perfume or cologne.

, Warriors live in the forest, so your backyard is a decent substitute. Shallow out a small nest in the bushes. Place specific flowers and plants in a medicine cat den. Doing this may show that you are really dedicated to your clan yard.

Purchase tickets to autograph signings.,
Attend a book signing.,
Take advantage of speaking engagements where celebrities are keynote speakers.,
Capitalize on live music events.,
Get autographs from your favorite athletes.",How to Get Autographs1," Autograph signings often require you pay a fee to attend. On a positive note, paying a fee guarantees you a high quality autograph for the celebrity you’re trying to get an autograph from.Keep tabs on autograph signings happening near you by signing up for the DeLuxe membership offered at SigningsHotline.com.
Be prepared to wait in a long line for a lengthy amount of time. Bring your smartphone to help you pass the time.;
, It’s the less expensive alternative to autograph signings. Just purchase a book to earn your spot in line and get an autograph.It’s a more controlled environment and allows you to connect with famous authors (actors, online influencers, politicians, television personalities) about something personal that touches on the subject matter of their book project.
You will usually have a much more authentic and engaged encounter than you would if the famous person in question was promoting a film.
Get more from your autograph encounter at the signing by asking the famous person for advice based on the subject matter of the book they wrote.

, Famous people sometimes go on press circuits, especially at popular public universities. Check your area for upcoming conferences and learn about their keynote speakers.Stand at the entrance or exit of the venue and ask for the speaker’s autograph in passing.
Ask questions and appear genuinely interested during discussions to stand out in the crowd of people while the famous person is making their speech. You will be a familiar face to them if you choose to approach them after the speech.

, Concerts tend to be the best opportunities to get autographs from musicians. Sometimes artists offer paid opportunities to receive an autograph. Other times, you just have to catch them at the right moment.


Consider purchasing a VIP package to get some one on one time with musicians backstage, often times with the accompaniment of an autograph signing.
Stand outside the concert venue near the artist’s tour bus and wait an hour or two to greet the celebrity as they walk to their bus after the show. They are typically kind enough to sign things for fans as they make their way to their bus to head to the next location.

, Stake out the ballpark or stadium during the season before and after games to see what athletes you might encounter. During the off-season, look into special sporting events like baseball card shows to meet players and get cards signed in person.


Try your luck at catching a baseball during a game. You might be able to get that ball signed after the game by a player.
Keep your eyes peeled for retired players who might be in the crowd with you during games and try going up to them to ask for an autograph. They are often very humbled by requests so don’t be shy.

Craft your letter with a personal touch.,
Show your knowledge of the celebrity you’re writing to.,
Prepare your letter to be sent.",How to Get Autographs2," When writing letters to celebrities, you have to make sure that your letter stands out and shows them that it is worth replying to. Skip the formality of typing your letters and sit down to handwrite one instead., Flesh your letter out by sharing ways you appreciate the celebrity and how their career influences you personally. Choose two or three different moments in their career that you admire and make sure you’re genuine in your praise and enthusiasm.Format your letter, starting it off with: Dear . Structure your letter into three paragraphs.In the first paragraph, you will compliment their talent and achievements. Celebrities can tell when you’re being insincere so make sure it’s a celebrity whose career you follow and admire so that you have a lot to talk about.
In the second paragraph, you will list your favorite work of theirs or something that really strikes you about their career. Showing them how much you know about their films and that you’ve followed the characters they’ve played will speak volumes of how much of a fan you are.
In the third, you will request to be sent an autograph or to have an item autographed. Tell them how appreciative you would be if they were to give you your autograph and make sure you thank them. Give them best wishes and close with your signature.

, Place your signed letter into a 9x12 envelope so that the celebrity can send an 8x10 signed photo if they choose to do so. Also include a self addressed 9x12 envelope in the packaging with your letter.Take things a step further by making things even more convenient for the celeb in question. Include the photo or item you want them to sign in the package.
If you are looking to collect autographs, include another item (a photo, a paper, a book, a card) in your package for the celebrity to sign. This will make authenticating the signature easier because you will have a reference to compare the signature to."

Search for celebrity addresses by finding their agents online.,
Locate celebrity addresses on other parts of the web.,
Send autograph requests directly to home stadiums.,
Wait for a reply.",How to Get Autographs3," An online alternative to magazine searches is the use of IMDB and their subscription service IMDBpro which lists the agents of many actors, providing you with information to help you direct your letters to the right agent., Although sending autograph requests to agents and firms come at a 50-60% response rate, sending your letter to those places prove no good if the celebrity is no longer with the agent or agency. There are a handful of other websites that help you keep your celebrity addresses current.As previously mentioned, The Internet Movie Database is a great credible resource for information on people working in television and film. Find your celebrity by searching their name in the search engine provided.
Other sites like FanMail.biz and Celebrity Fans are other free online resources that offer some success with locating celebrity address information. On FanMail.biz, read the forums to check out the success and failure rates other fans have had with writing to celebrities for autographs.

, Athletes can be reached by contacting them directly through the team they play for. Send the letter at the player’s attention, c/o the team they play for underneath, and include the name of the stadium, and the address on the recipient portion of the envelope.Look at the official websites for the leagues to get a rundown of the teams and the official venues they call home. For example, for a roundup of baseball teams in the league, find it here: http://mlb.mlb.com/team/

Spring training facilities, TV studios, and minor league affiliates might be an effective way to get a reply to sent autograph requests as well.

, Celebrities are very busy people with hectic and demanding schedules. Have patience for the length of time it takes to hear back from an autograph request you’ve sent. Sometimes it takes weeks, sometimes it takes months. It can even take up to a year to hear back from a celebrity, so be patient."

Go to your library.,
Tap and hold the book you would like to archive.,
Tap on ""Archive.” The ""Archive"" option should be at the bottom of the menu.,
Repeat as needed.,
If you experience problems, check your wi-fi connection.",How to Archive Books on Nook1," The process of archiving a book on your Nook is basically the same no matter whether you're using a Nook tablet or you're using the Nook app on your mobile device. To start, open your Nook library — the menu where your books and other documents are displayed.


On a Nook tablet, you can press the button that looks like an upside down ""U"" at any time to access the navigation bar. Once you do this, click ""Library"" to access your library.
On smartphones, the quickest way to get to your library can vary. For instance, on iOS, if you're reading a book, you can tap the middle of the screen to display the tools menu, then tap the option in the top left to get to your library.On Android, you can use the same approach or simply hit the back button.;
, Next, scroll through the list of books and find the first book in your library that you'd like to archive. Tap on it and hold down. A menu of options should appear. You may release your hold when this list shows up.

, Clicking this will remove the selected book from your device, freeing up space for different books.


To be clear, you will still own the book after archiving it — archiving the book stores it in the cloud, rather than deleting it entirely. You can easily get your books back after archiving them (see below for more information.)

, Repeat the sequence above for every book that you'd like to archive. When you've archived your last book, congratulations — you're done! If you'd like, you can now fill the space you've just freed up with new books.

, The archival process requires a valid wi-fi connection to work. Since the archived books are stored in a remote server until you want to access them again, the Nook needs access to the internet to be able to transmit these books to the server. Thus, if you're unable to archive your books, the most likely culprit is your wi-fi connection. Double-check your device's wi-fi settings and, if you're at home, consider resetting your router.

Let him know how you are or hope to build it.Tell Mark Cuban what you are presently doing to build your business and what successes you have already had with it.,
Show some value.Wrap up the pitch by offering a glimpse of your revenue projections.,
Be creative and confident.,
Keep it brief.,
Give it a day or two.",How to Contact Mark Cuban1," Cuban's personal email addresses are kept fairly private, so it can be difficult to track these down unless you have an inside source. Thankfully, he does have a couple of email addresses that are known publicly, and you can still use one of these to contact him with your ideas and questions.


The first email address you should try is: mcuban@outlook.com (note 1/11/2015 - this email no longer exists)
Cuban is also the chairman, CEO, and president of AXS TV. You can use his company email address to get in touch with him: mcuban@axs.tvAs owner of the Dallas Mavericks, Cuban has an email address associated with the team, as well: mark.cuban@dallasmavs.comSupposedly, Cuban's investment email address is an open secret within the tech community, but that email address is difficult to find for those outside of the community. If you have a tech product and contacts within that community, though, you might be able to ask around and eventually stumble across it.;
, Before you get to work on the body of the email, you need to make sure that your message has an informative subject line that will let Mark Cuban know what your email is about before he even opens it.


Try to keep your subject to 20 characters or less. This character count makes it easy to see the full subject if the email is checked via a smart phone.
An option worth considering would be to quickly summarize the type of business you are trying to promote. For example, ""Social App Start-Up.""

, The tone and structure of your email should be polite, respectful, and professional.


Address him as “Mr. Cuban.”
Use proper English. Stay away from Internet abbreviations: “u” instead of “you,” “r” instead of “are,” and so on.
Your email should have a greeting, followed by a well-structured body, a business-appropriate closing, and your name and contact information.

,


Your company should have a name and a product. Having nothing more than an idea probably won't get you very far. Instead, you should wait until you have made as much progress as you can with it on your own before sending an email to Cuban.

,


Describe products that you have already put out, promotions you have already engaged in, awards you may have won, prominent people in the industry you have hired or contracted, and other similar information. The more impressive you can make your current progress sound, the more promising your odds of success will seem to him.

, The idea is to show Cuban what value your business could bring to him, as well as what value you, as an entrepreneur, also have to offer.


Explain how your business or product fits the profile of the type of company Cuban usually invests in. Also describe what your company can offer that others are unable to offer.

, As you pitch your business, you need to be creative enough to catch Cuban's attention and confident enough to make him believe in you. If you show a lack of confidence in yourself, he will likely lack confidence in you, as well.

, Cuban is a busy individual who receives a large quantity of emails per day. If you send him a long email right from the start, he might skip over it. Giving him a short email packed with only vital information is far better option.


If he likes your idea, he will reply asking for additional detail. Provide that detail after he asks for it, not before.

, People who have successfully heard back from Cuban typically say that the investor replies within 24 hours, so if he will respond to your email, you will probably get that response within a day or two.

, He also has a regularly updated Twitter account, so if you want to send him a quick note, you can do so by directing your tweet to @mcuban.


Visit his Twitter page at: https://twitter.com/mcuban

Find his Pinterest page at: https://www.pinterest.com/markcuban/

Cuban's pins generally relate to his current companies.
In addition to commenting on one of his pins, you can also make a pin advertising your own company and send that pin to Cuban through the website. Include a quick description of it in your comments as you send it so that it will have a better chance of grabbing his attention.

, If only have a question to ask JK Rowling, and you don't want to send a whole fan letter, you can try asking your question through twitter. Write your question and add @jk_rowling to the beginning of your tweet.

, Because JK Rowling gets so much fan mail, anything that stands out is going to be more likely to get a response.

Just make sure you write very clearly and legibly if you choose to handwrite.

Write about what Harry Potter means to you.Mention a few specific parts or details in Harry Potter that you liked in particular and explain why.

, You're much more likely to get a response if you give Rowling a question or two to answer. At this point she's likely heard pretty much every question imaginable about Harry Potter. But regardless, try to think of something somewhat original to ask. Something vague and unoriginal like ""What inspired you to write Harry Potter?"" isn't going to pique much interest. , If you have any creative interests, like writing or drawing, put them to use to make your letter to JK Rowling unique. Add a drawing or a poem along with your letter. It can be inspired by Harry Potter but it doesn't have to be., Don't go on and on in your letter. Keep in mind how many of these Rowling has to read on a regular basis. It might be wise to go back through your letter after writing it and edit it, cutting it down until it's concise."

Introduce yourself.,
Be specific.,
Ask questions.,
Include your contact information.,
Proofread.,
Contact the Carter Center.,
Contact the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library & Museum.,
Contact Emory University.,
Contact the Rosalynn Carter Butterfly Trail.,
Contact the Carter House.",How to Contact Jimmy Carter," This is your opportunity to introduce yourself and explain why you wanted to reach out to President Carter. This doesn’t have to be an extensive introduction. Your name, where you’re from, and whether you’re a student or a professional should all be included.


In an email, you have less space for introductions so you can keep it short.
If you are a student who is contacting President Carter because of a school project you could say something like, ""Hello President Carter, My name is Sarah and I am a 6th grade student at Monroe Elementary. We learned about you during class and I was really interested in the work that you have done to receive the Nobel Peace Prize."";
, Once you’ve introduced yourself, you can get to the main point of your message. This section should describe why you’re reaching out to President Carter and for what reason. This makes your letter more personal and gives you an opportunity to connect with your reader. It can also help to increase your chances of receiving a response.


Some reasons you might reach out would be to congratulate him on a recent achievement, to thank him for his work, to share how his work has impacted your life, or to request an interview or meeting.If you’ve ever attended any event where President Carter spoke, or you’ve met him before, include that information. For example, you could say ""I attended a lecture at Emory University on July 16th where you spoke about your work with the Carter Center. I wasn't able to attend the meet and greet session after the lecture so I wanted to reach out to you via letter.""
Making your letter personal also helps to reduce the possibility that a staffer thinks it is spam. Since President Carter receives fan mail frequently, his staff have to filter out spam messages and you don't want that to happen to your thoughtful letter.

, Asking a specific question that you would like President Carter to answer is one way that you could receive a personalized response in return. Your questions should be relevant to the rest of your letter.


For example, if you are writing to thank him for his work with the Carter Center in establishing health care delivery systems in Africa you could ask him about how the Center plans to expand the program in the next year., Whether you reach out through email or in a letter, you should include your address and contact information. Since President Carter does not respond by email, he will need your postal address to be able to respond to you.


You can include either your home or business address, as long as you’re able to receive mail there.
Include a return envelope that has your address on it along with the appropriate postage. This will help to increase your chances of receiving a reply and is a courteous gesture.

, Once you have written your letter, you should take some time to read through it again to check for any grammatical errors and to make sure your message is clear. Even though your letter is personal, you should treat it as a piece of professional communication. You don't want to have any spelling or grammatical errors that would distract from your message to the President.


Double check that you have correctly written the address on the envelope and that your contact information is accurate.

, The Carter Center is a global foundation that President Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, operate with Emory University. Contacting President Carter through the Carter Center is your best option to receive a response.Their address is “The Carter Center, 432 Freedom Parkway, Atlanta, GA 30307”
Their email address is info@cartercenter.org.
President and Mrs. Carter do not respond by email. If you would like to receive a response from the Carters, please include your full postal address. If you have scheduling or interview requests you can mail a formal request to the Center’s address.

, The Presidential Library is adjacent to the Carter Center and is part of the Presidential Library system. Staffers at the library may be able to direct your communication to President Carter personally.Their address is “441 Freedom Parkway Northeast, Atlanta, GA 30307”
You can send a message through their website. You will receive a response from a staffer who can then help direct you to President Carter., President Carter has been teaching at Emory University since 1982, after he finished his term as President.He currently hosts an annual town hall meeting with first year students at Emory. If you attend Emory, this is a great opportunity to meet President Carter.


President Carter’s Emory email is carterweb@emory.edu. It is unclear how frequently this email is checked by President Carter himself but it is likely checked by staffers., This is a good address to use if you are looking for educational resources from the Carter family. If you are a teacher or student who wants to reach out to former Presidents as part of a class project, this is the address you should contact first.You can send mail to “Rosalynn Carter Butterfly Trail, PO Box 17, Plains, Georgia 31780”.
Email can be sent to plainsed@jimmycarter.info.

, The Carter House is the first and only home the Carters have ever owned and has been the family’s permanent residence since 1961.The mailing address is “209 Woodland Drive, Plains, Sumter County GA 31780.""

Reach out to celebrities through their agent or publicist.,
Craft a suitable message.,
Send your message.",How to Contact Famous Celebrities3," Typically, agents are used for booking celebrities for an appearance, concert, endorsement, movie, or similar activities. Publicists deal with anything related to the public, like magazines articles, blogs, and interviews.

Agents, managers, and publicists each have their own parts that they represent for a celebrity. They handle the business and image aspects of the celebrity. There are a few different ways of getting in touch with these representatives.
The best way is through email, and it is how most business deals are done with celebrities. Email allows for a paper trail, and it is the preferred method of contact for representatives.
Phone is another route to take, but it is not the preferred route. Also its important to keep in mind that many representatives have assistants and gatekeepers, so you will likely be unable to reach the representative by phone.
By snail mail isn't a feasible option unless you are sending free product to someone. Even doing this, you want to have spoken through the representative through email or by phone.
Please note that representatives are only to be reached out to for business and publicity inquiries, not for fan mail.
Celebrities change representatives frequently. You can monitor these changes through booking agent info databases.
A celebrity’s manager is involved in all aspects of their career. Less known celebrities may only have a manager. These people are generally very busy, but can help you contact your celebrity.
You may be able to find manager, agent, or publicist information through your celebrity’s Facebook page.
Look on your celebrity’s Internet Movie Database (IMDB) or Wikipedia page. You can often find publicist or management company information in these places. Then look up the publicist or management company contact information. , Depending on the contact information you’ve found, this could be a written letter or email. You might want to break the letter into two parts, one for the publicist and one for the celebrity. Be clear and to the point. Be straightforward in your request for a return message to prove your contact.


When addressing a publicist, manager, etc., you might want to say something like, “Thank you for helping us fans get in touch with so-and-so.”
Include a request with your message when appropriate. It would be natural to ask a concert promoter, for example, for a ticket to a concert and a chance to meet the celebrity.
Some celebrities have a considerable number of staff managing their public relations. If you have the contact information for a few of these, try them all. It’s unlikely these people will discuss amongst themselves fan mail they’ve read., It may take some time before you receive a response to your message. In some cases, you may get a “canned” response, where you receive a pre-made message that says something to the effect of, “The celebrity is too busy to respond to your message now.”


After a reasonable period of time has passed, like a few weeks to a month, try another means of contact. Aim to make yourself noticeable among other fans, but not overbearing."

Send Clarkson a personal message on LinkedIn.,
Tweet to Jeremy Clarkson.,
Send Jeremy Clarkson a Facebook message.,
Follow the terms and services of all social media you use.",How to Contact Jeremy Clarkson2," Although Jeremy Clarkson is a celebrity, he does maintain a LinkedIn page. LinkedIn is a social media site that functions like a virtual resume. You include details of your work-related experience on your portfolio. If you want to contact Clarkson more directly, consider sending him a private message on LinkedIn.


If you don't have a LinkedIn profile, you can easily create one. You just need a relevant e-mail address.
Remember, LinkedIn is a professional tool. Prospective employers may look you up on LinkedIn. If you choose to create a profile, keep your profile professional. Include all your work experience in your profile and avoid using profanity, slang, or negative language about past employers.
Keep in mind Clarkson likely gets many messages on LinkedIn each day. You may not hear back from Clarkson if you do message him.

, Twitter is a fun social media site in which you can post messages of 140 characters. You can use Twitter to Tweet a short message to a celebrity. Jeremy Clarkson is on Twitter, using the handle @JeremyClarkson.If you don't have a Twitter account, you can create one using your e-mail address.
To contact Jeremy Clarkson on Twitter, simply search for his Twitter in the search bar on the top righthand corner of the page. Then, type in ""@JeremyClarkson."" When you reach Clarkson's page, there should be a button that says ""Tweet to Jeremy Clarkson"" under his picture. Click this button and compose your message.
Twitter messages are usually short and celebrities get thousands of messages on Twitter each day. Do not attempt to contact Clarkson for a professional speaking engagement through Twitter, as it's unlikely he'll respond. You also will not be able to fit in all the necessary details when contacting Clarkson through Twitter alone.

, Jeremy Clarkson does have a Facebook account. Even if you are not friends with him, you can still send him a message. Keep in mind Twitter and LinkedIn may be better options. Facebook usually filters messages that come from unknown users. Clarkson may easily miss a Facebook message.

, All social media comes with certain terms and services. When using social media to contact Jeremy Clarkson, make sure to follow the rules to avoid getting banned.


Do not create a fake LinkedIn profile to contact Jeremy Clarkson. LinkedIn bans the creation of fake profiles. If your profile is for a fake person, or if you create a fake profile for a celebrity, LinkedIn will remove your profile quickly.Facebook also bans fake profiles. Facebook users are encouraged to report profiles they believe are fake.Posting threatening or abusive messages on Twitter or Facebook is against the rules. If you post any contact that could be deemed threatening or hateful, this may result in your account getting suspended. You should also avoid sending threatening or hostile private messages on these sites.Spam is also not allowed on Twitter, Facebook, or LinkedIn. Posting links to websites that contain malware, information about pyramid schemes, or using multiple accounts to post spam will result in your account getting terminated."

Include all the key details about an event.,
Have enthusiasm.,
Use social media for less important messages.,
Expect it will take awhile to hear back.",How to Contact Jeremy Clarkson3," When contacting Jeremy Clarkson for an event, make sure to include all the important details. Clarkson and his team get many messages each day about speaking events. Messages that leave out details may be ignored.


Include the date and location of the event. Double-check to make sure these details are accurate.
If you usually pay speakers, include information about pay rates for your company or organization. You should also include information about where Clarkson will stay for the event. For example, maybe your company usually puts speakers up in a specific hotel.
Add some details about your event. Clarkson and his team will want to know a little about your organization and its mission. You should also include a link to your company website so Clarkson can learn more about your organization if he's interested.

, You're more likely to hear back from Clarkson if you have enthusiasm in your messages. If you're trying to book Clarkson for a charity event, enthusiasm about your cause is particularly important. Remember, Clarkson gets many requests each day. You have to sell your company if you want Clarkson to agree to speak.


Include an interesting opening line. For example, if you're booking Clarkson for a charity event, you can start with a fact or a quote relevant to your cause. Something like, ""Did you know over 20% of Chicago elementary school students are illiterate?""
Convey why your speaking event is important. What does Clarkson have to gain by coming to your company or organization? Talk about your culture. Is it particularly welcoming? Are your employees a lot of fun?
However, try to keep it brief. Try to condense enthusiasm to a short paragraph. Clarkson and his officials get a lot of requests each day and may not read an e-mail if it's too long.

, Social media is usually not meant for professional contact. If you want to mention to Clarkson that you loved his appearance on a talk show last night, this would be appropriate to post on Twitter. However, if you want to ask Clarkson to appear at your charity event, contact him through a professional organization like Speakers Corner.

, Clarkson is very busy. If you want to book him for an event, it may take awhile to hear back. You should aim to book Clarkson months before the event if you expect him to attend. On social media, it may be unlikely that you hear back. Clarkson may not respond to all Tweets and LinkedIn messages as he simply does not have the time.

Contact his manager for an interview.The majority of artists are open to interviews with media outlets.,
Be realistic.",How to Contact Lenny Kravitz1," Aligning yourself with or even supporting one of these causes may get you your foot in the door. If you're just a fan, volunteering for a cause like this will give you and Kravitz some common ground beyond the regular fan dynamic.


Lenny Kravitz is also devoutly Christian. Although being Christian isn't necessary in order to contact Lenny, you should at least have a respect for his beliefs if you want things to go over well.;
, Although chances are slim that you'll get a word in alone with him, you can try hanging out by his tour bus or limo by the venue after the show is over. Keep in mind, however, that you may have to compete with other fans for his attention. Even if your reasons for contacting him are legitimate, it will almost certainly be difficult to make yourself heard.


There may be VIP ticket options for an upcoming show in which you can ""meet and greet"" with Kravitz beforehand.

, If your prospective business with Kravitz is related to a show, you can make things happen via his booking agent. Although they won't respond unless you have the proper down payment available, getting a hold of a celebrity via one of their proxies is easily the most professional way you can go about it.

Address it to “Agency for the Performing Arts, 405 South Beverly Drive, Beverly Hills, CA 90212.”, Interviews are a mutually beneficial arrangement, as it attracts mutual buzz to both the outlet and artist.

, As with any celebrity, getting in contact with someone as famous and busy as Lenny Kravitz is a slim chance at best if you're starting from scratch. Unless you're already well-established in the music business, you shouldn't keep your fingers crossed that you'll be able to reach him. You are best off contacting his manager or agents rather than trying to contact Lenny right off the bat.

Determine how many members you hope to have.,
Keep gender in mind.,
Bear in mind age and circumstance.,
Contact your friends.,
Post an ad.,
Comb through online communities devoted to romance fiction.,
Post on related forums, as well.",How to Start a Romance Book Club1," Too few members may mean that the conversation will run dry too soon, while too many members could make some uncomfortable and may make it impossible for everyone to get a turn to talk.


Consider the atmosphere you want to create. Generally, romance book clubs tend to be a little more personal and close-knit, so you may want to shoot for a limit of four to eight members.;
, Women are generally more likely to join a book club, and this is especially true for romance book clubs. While you probably won’t have many men asking for admittance, you should still decide whether or not to even allow them to join. Romance novels tend to be fairly intimate, and some women may feel uncomfortable talking about them in when men are around.

, A 16 year old single girl is likely to have different ideas about romance than a 32 year old married mother of three. You do not need to put a strict limit on who can join, but setting an age range may help your group to focus its interests.

, The easiest way to find new members is to ask friends and family with a passion for reading to join you. You can also spread the word to friends who would not be interested in joining, just in case they know someone who might be.

, Put a flyer up at your local library, take out an ad in the paper, or post about your new club on a free classifieds website with a section for your region. Describe the purpose of your group, the types of romance books you plan on reading, and any restrictions on membership.

, Message boards and blogs dedicated to the discussion of romance books are a good place to start. Even though these websites already offer book discussions, a few of the members may be interested in breaking off into a smaller group to discuss a specific book. Similarly, if enough members are from the same geographic location, they may want to meet in person to discuss their favorite romances.

, Message boards tailored to women or those that discuss love and relationships are likely to have a few members who enjoy a good romance novel and have an interest in joining your club.

Meet in private.,
Meet in public.,
Meet online.,
Decide how often to meet.,
Set a few basic rules.,
Figure out the format.,
Make time for gossip.",How to Start a Romance Book Club2," If your group is small enough and your members are comfortable enough with each other, you can meet in your homes. As the group’s leader, you can either hold each meeting in your own home or ask if anyone else would be willing to take turns hosting. No one should feel pressured into hosting, however.

, Choose a public place that offers some level of privacy; otherwise, the shyest of your members may not feel comfortable voicing her ideas and opinions on the intimate details. Think library conference rooms, restaurants with secluded seating, and sparsely populated parks.

, You can set up a small forum, chat room, blog, social media group, or e-mail group. This may make it difficult for any members who are not technologically adept, but this option also allows you to meet with members from virtually any geographic location. Plus, you never need to worry about needing to cancel a meeting due to bad weather or construction.

, If you only want to meet whenever you finish a book, you may want to schedule your meetings on a monthly basis. If you want to meet periodically to discuss the book in the midst of reading it, schedule meetings on a weekly or bi-weekly basis.

, The biggest, most obvious rules are to show up and to read the book. You may not need to set up any official rules outside of that unless problems arise between members later on.

, Will you consistently lead discussions, or should each member take a turn? Should you come up with a list of discussion questions to cover, or would members be better off saying whatever is on their mind? It may take you a few meetings before you can figure out what discussion format works best for your group.

, Reading about romance may make the members of your group want to talk about their own love lives, but doing so in the midst of book club takes away from valuable discussion time. Instruct members who want to socialize to meet a little beforehand, or invite them to stay past your scheduled book club time.

Set the ""heat level."",
Stick with one sub-genre.,
Pick books from multiple sub-genres.,
Venture into nonfiction.,
Read a classic romance.,
Select a current bestseller.,
Ask for suggestions.,
Read different books and compare.",How to Start a Romance Book Club3," Romance books range from sugary sweet and innocent to saucy and erotic, and not every reader will enjoy both degrees. Talk with your members to determine what level of heat everyone feels comfortable with. Alternatively, you can start by selecting the heat level you would be most interested in reading and aim to find members with the same tastes.

, Romance books generally fall under a specific sub-genre. If you want to keep things focused and simple, select one sub-genre and stick to books that fall into that category. Generally, when most people think of a straight-forward romance novel, they think of contemporary romance. These books take place after World War II and involved realistic characters and scenarios.

, To make things a little more interesting, mix up your sub-genres every now and then. You could start with a contemporary romance before switching to a historical romance. After that, you could branch into paranormal romance, romantic suspense, inspirational romance, or any other sub-genre.

, The goal of your club is to read romance books, but not every romance book is completely fictitious. Give your members a refreshing look at reality by occasionally selecting a book based on a true romance.

, Think of Jane Austen or the Brontë sisters. The books these authors wrote describe romances that have resonated with readers throughout the ages. Reading a classic here or there pays homage to these early pioneers of the romance genre.

, Plenty of romance books make the bestseller list. If all else fails, simply choose a romance book that everybody’s talking about. The outside interest in the book may spark even more interest inside your group.

, Your members may appreciate your willingness to take their opinions into consideration. You can either take turns choosing, or you can each offer up a suggestion and take a vote.

, Even though you should usually read the same book in order to facilitate more discussion, you can occasionally change things up by each selecting a cheap paperback romance of comparable lengths and compare notes. Compare the characters, setting, and plot points to determine what works best out of each book.

Start collecting materials.,
Establish members.,
Work out the details.,
Advertise!,
Plan out the meetings.,
Make it fun for all members.,
Inspire others.,
Compete in the fan club too.",How to Start a Harry Potter Fan Club," There are some things you will certainly want:


The entire series of books 1-7
The entire series of movies 1-8
Textbooks, etc (Quidditch Through the Ages, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, etc)
A CD of your favorite Wizard Rock songs (or just put them on your iPod)
Merchandise, like the Marauders' Map or the Time Turner
A wand
Posters
Bonus feature disks;
, You can't have a club with only you and your friend! Ask around and see if people are interested. Contact people in your school, the library and bookstores. Once you see that people would want to come to your club, then proceed with the rest of the steps.

, Here are some things to think about:


Where will it be? Find an empty room you can use and make it Harry Potter-ish. Cover the walls in posters, display the merchandise, play Wrock at all times, have a movie playing on some sort of screen, and make everything blue, green, red, or yellow. Try to make it look like a common room, but with all four houses. Find wall stickers of things like the Hogwarts Crest, the Deathly Hallows, etc and put them on the walls.

Think of a special time when you can hold a club meeting. For example, maybe every Monday for an hour after school? And you would also need a place to meet! Some suggestions for places would be a local park, a coffee house or the library. Also, maybe you can alternate places with friends. Like one day you could have it at your friend's house, the next meeting at yours, etc.

, Make posters and hang them up around town and on the local bulletin board. Send emails to all of your friends, informing them about the club! Post on several sources of social media including Facebook and Twitter (along with any other blogs you might have accounts with).

, You can read extracts from the Harry Potter Series, play Harry Potter video games, do Harry Potter trivia and it's better have many members. You're fans; you know what to do, right?

, You want to make sure all members of the group continue to be enthused right from the beginning till the very last meeting, so no group member ever misses any meeting.

, With so many Harry Potter fans out there, there are some people who aren't. Perhaps get them to join the club too.

, You club members shouldn't be the only ones to give feedback and perform duties and stuff.

Figure out what your book club will read, for both your first novel and in general.,
Find a core group of people with a passion for reading.,
Decide where to meet.,
Set meeting time length.,
Poll members of your club.,
Announce your first meeting.,
Start thinking of a cabinet.,
Make a list of about five books and bring it to the meeting.,
Be open to suggestions and constructive criticisms.,
Ask members to enroll new members.",How to Start a Book Club," Will you be a general adult book club reading anything? A teen mystery book club? Deciding on a theme (or no theme, in the case of the first example) will help you keep you group motivated and supplied with reading ideas.;
, They could be friends, family, or acquaintances you know through various activities, but they should all love to read. Also, make sure that this core group of members can commit to meetings on a regular basis. You don't want your entire group flaking out on you!

, When you first begin, especially if the members are friends or you plan to serve alcohol, meeting your own home is a great idea. Later, different members could ""host"" different meetings. If there are members that you are not quite as familiar with, or don't want to meet at your house, ask your local library about using some of their space for a book club.

, An hour is a good start. Eventually, two hours or an hour and a half may work better if you add more members to your group. Don't exceed two hours, because when meetings get too long people get bored. When people get bored, they quit coming to meetings. Your club could end before it even begins if it gets a reputation of being boring.

, Ask what books they have been reading and what times and dates work best for them to meet.

, Set the date at least two weeks in advance, to allow for people to have time to read the book. Three weeks is even better. Send out e-mails a week before the meeting to give people a written reminder.

, For instance, vote for president, vice president, secretary, and get a few people for a club newsletter. This step is optional for smaller groups, but is very handy for very large groups of over ten or fifteen people.

, Get ideas for books from the internet or library recommendations. Let everyone discuss and vote upon what book to read for the next meeting. After deciding, let everyone get to know each other and discuss their reading tastes.


Serve snacks and refreshments. This can help start conversation and will keep people much more content. Your refreshments don't need to be fancy or expensive; cookies, breads, nuts, and popcorn are all good ideas. Be mindful of vegetarian members or members watching their weight.

, Actively invite suggestions from members at every meeting on how to improve the functioning of the club.

, Request every member to bring in their book loving friends to the club. Leave scope for prospective members to participate in meetings so that they can get a feel before actually joining.

Find a nearby library with a conference room.,
Ask the library if a book club already meets there.,
Fill out the necessary paperwork.,
Ask if the library allows refreshments.,
Figure out the type of books you plan on reading.,
Decide how often to meet.,
Figure out when to meet.",How to Start a Library Book Club1," Many public libraries have conference rooms that are open for public use, but private libraries or public libraries in smaller towns may not have a conference room within the facility. If your city or county does not have an available room, look for a nearby library that will allow you to set up a club even if you are outside of its district.;
, Some libraries may not want more than one library book club to meet on the premises. Others may not mind, but remember that many people who want to be part of a library book club may already be members of the other club or clubs.

, Most libraries do not require extensive paperwork to start a new club, but almost all libraries will have some. At the very least, the library will probably ask you to read a list of rules about hosting a club and to sign your name to a sheet of paper, documenting that you read those rules.

, Most public libraries are fine with light refreshments, such as punch as cookies, as long as they are kept within the conference room. Not all libraries are fine with it, however, so you should check before deciding whether or not to provide any at your meetings.

, Ask yourself if you want a book group that is limited to literary books or to a certain genre, or if you want a group that is open to any genre.

, Most book clubs meet about once a month. Meeting on a monthly basis gives most members ample time to read each book. Moreover, a monthly meeting does not overtax library resources.

, As a general rule, weekdays work better for more people than weekends. If you want to attract a crowd of retirees or stay-at-home moms, meeting in the late morning or early afternoon works best. If you want to attract teens, you should shoot for the early evening. If you want to attract college students or working adults, the late evening may work even better.


Stick with one set day out of each month, such as the third Tuesday or the fourth Thursday. Go with a day of the week instead of a date, since dates can fall out on the weekend just as easily as they can fall out during the week.

Choose a number.,
Write the perfect advertisement.,
Advertise at the library.,
Ask people you know.,
Ask people you see.,
Attend other library events and search for potential members.,
Place an advertisement in the local paper.",How to Start a Library Book Club2," You need a minimum of three or five members to have an active conversation at each meeting, but you should not exceed a group of 12 or 15. If you have more members than that, the odds of hearing from everyone who wants to speak are greatly reduced.

, Include the basic information, such as the date and time you plan on meeting as well as the types of books you plan on covering. Also include an e-mail address or phone number that interested parties can use to contact you for further information or to RSVP to the first meeting.

, Ask if you can place flyers at the check-out counter or near the computers. If not, find out if there is a bulletin board or anywhere else inside the library where you could hang a flyer.


If your library is part of a large enough branch, it may have a website that lists the various events going on at the library. If so, request that your library adds your book club to the calendar.







, Relatives, friends, and acquaintances are all good people to consider, especially if you know someone who loves reading. You can also ask people you know to spread the word to others.

, Even if you do not know them personally, you can bring up your book club to workers or customers at the bookstore, members of your church, parents whose children go to school with your son or daughter, or patrons sipping coffee and reading a book in the local cafe. You can even invite the librarian to stop by your group.

, If your library hosts other clubs or one-day events, attend a few of these and find out if any of the members would be interested in joining a book club. Since the people there are already familiar with events held at the library, they may feel more comfortable or willing to attend a library book club.

, If you cannot garner enough interest using more focused means, you can advertise your library book club in the local paper several weeks before the first scheduled meeting. You can also place a similar advertisement on a free online classifieds website.

Pick books that are available at the library.,
Strike a deal with your library.,
Choose books that are fairly complex.,
Ask for opinions.,
Come with questions prepared.,
Ask each member to bring in a discussion question.",How to Start a Library Book Club3," One of the best parts about hosting a library book club is that it becomes far easier to borrow the book from the library instead of buying it. If you take this option, however, you need to stick with books that are popular enough to have enough copies for all your members within the district, but not so popular that all those copies will already be checked out by non-members.

, Many libraries receive discounted rates on the books they buy. Your library may be willing to buy books for your library book club at those discounted rates as long as you offer to donate the books to the library once you finish. Getting first access to library books will be an incentive for people to join your club, which will draw more traffic into the library.

, Simple stories do not lend themselves to much discussion. On the other hand, books that are controversial, books that raise many issues, and books with unclear endings or intricate details usually offer a lot to talk about.

, Once you have a solid member base built, you can begin taking requests and suggestions from your members. You can either take turns choosing or put each suggestion up for a vote.

, Create at least 10 to 15 open-ended questions for each book. Do not allow members to simply state that they liked or did not like the book. Ask questions that encourage them to explain why they have the opinion they have.

, Since every member will be reading the book from a slightly different perspective, you may find yourself surprised by how varied the questions and ideas will be.

Create a reading timeline with your book club members!,
Accumulate some information on Tim O'Brien, the author of Going After Cacciato.,
Schedule in-person meetings with your book club members.,
Read the book!,
Consider reaching out to learn about real war experiences.,
Have an ""after book discussion"" to further deepen your understanding of the text.","How to Run a Book Club for ""Going After Cacciato"" by Tim O'Brien"," One of the most crucial aspects of your book club will be to create a schedule that works for everyone. Especially with this book, reading in sync is key. Tim O'Brien uses ambiguity in Going After Cacciato to illustrate themes, and you don't want any member of the group reading too far ahead, or falling behind. Try to work around people's work obligations, so that you can read in larger chunks. The book is larger than most, and will take time to complete. A reading schedule is a helpful tool to begin your book club on Going After Cacciato.
, Understanding his background and personal experiences are extremely important to understanding the author. Tim O'Brien's life is reflected in his writing, and the more familiar you are with who he is and how he writes, the more comfortable you will be with this text., These ""socratic seminars"" if you will, will allow all members to articulate questions they've been having as well as other thoughts and opinions on the book so far.

It's wise to schedule these meetings along with your reading timeline, so that you can discuss the book at certain stopping points. Keep in mind the obligations of your group members. Since these meetings involve talking with one another, it's important than all or most group members can attend. This is where in depth analysis of the book and its themes occurs.

, Going After Cacciato is a unique book that describes the mental and physical journey of an inexperienced soldier named Paul Berlin. The story switches between several realities, and can thus be moderately confusing. It's important to ask questions as you read, and maybe even write down your thoughts. Tim O'Brien's writing is blunt, but provided deep insight into the life and minds of those who fought for their lives in the Vietnam war, and for those who decided to put down their guns... and run., When you have reached the halfway point in this book, your next step is a voluntary trip to a veterans' home. Take some time to meet with Vietnam war veterans, or veterans from another time in history. Hearing the real war stories of the men and women who served so bravely only fuels our understanding of the world around us. Experience is the anecdote to ignorance.

Remember to be respectful of all veterans, and recognize their importance in our country's history. This book is merely a reflection of that struggle.

, Going After Cacciato is a book with many layers, so it can enjoyable to discuss what you learned from it. Also, talk about what you liked and didn't like. Here are some sample questions to further his discussion:

Did you like this book? Why or why not?
Who was your favorite character?
Did any themes strike you?
Was this novel different than previous ones you've read?
Do you disagree/agree with any claims made in this book?
Was this book easy or hard to read?
Would you recommend this book to a friend?

,

,

Choose which books to read as a group.,
Consider a social break or movie night to transition from book to book.

",How to Plan a Successful Book Club," Starting a book club is easier than you may think, but it all begins with a clear intention. Setting a proper focus for your book club can help alleviate frustration and disappointment down the road (for yourself and other book club members of your group).;
,  You can extend invitations via phone call, an in-person conversation, email or text message. Keep in mind, the more personal the invitation, the more likely you'll get a ""yes.""

,,, For example, where will meetings be held? Will one person always host, or will members take turns? Are refreshments provided potluck style, or does the host supply snacks and drinks? Is alcohol allowed or encouraged or reserved for after-meeting socializing? The group should come to agreement on these issues and other logistics.

, This is by far the most collaborative part of creating a book club. Refer to the Tips section for suggestions on choosing reading selections.

Figure out where to meet.,
Decide how often to meet.,
Choose when to meet.,
Know how long you expect each meeting to take.,
Set some ground rules.,
Keep in touch.,
Offer refreshments.",How to Start a Business Book Club1," You will likely want to keep the meetings professional, so personal locations like home should be avoided. Conference rooms, whether at an office or in a library, are usually best for a business book club. If you cannot secure a conference room, meeting in a coffee shop or restaurant that has space for large, talkative groups to meet are the next best thing.;
, Standard protocol is once a month. Meeting more often may make it difficult for members to keep up on a reading schedule, but meeting less often can make it hard for members to focus and many may lose interest.

, You must consider time and date.


Weekdays are generally better than weekends, since many people may feel hesitant about surrendering a portion of their Saturday or Sunday for book club.
You should meet in the early evening, around 7:00 PM, to give your members enough time to come home and grab something to eat before going to book club. Meeting too late may make it difficult for them to get a full night’s sleep before getting up in the morning for work, though.
Stick with a consistent meeting date. For instance, choosing the first Wednesday or the third Thursday of every month will make it easier for your members to remember the meeting date and schedule around it accordingly.

, A standard length is about 60 minutes, but if you and your members are on a tight schedule, you might be able to shorten that to 30 minutes.


Conversely, if you want time to socialize or talk about non-club topics, you may want to schedule an optional 30 minutes for interested members to hang around and socialize after official meeting business is over.

, Start with the basics. You don’t need anything too extreme to keep your book club in working condition.


The most important rules are to read the book before each meeting and to actually show up to the meetings.
Members who are unable to show up to a meeting should let you know beforehand.
Members who plan to come to a meeting should show up on time.
Everyone should show respect for one another's opinions.
No one should use the business book club as a blatant excuse to pitch his or her business.

, The business book club, much like the modern business world, benefits greatly from the use of technology. Ask members for their cell phone numbers and e-mail addresses. Each member should, at the very least, be able to communicate with one another via e-mail.


You can also consider setting up a blog, forum, or other website for your business book group to use for communication purposes. These extra steps are not necessary, but they can be especially helpful for large or expanding groups.

, They don’t need to be anything much. Just about anyone will appreciate a pot of coffee and a box of donuts or a pizza and soft drinks. At the start, the expense will rest on your shoulders. Once your business book club gains momentum, however, you can ask other members if they might also be willing to bring something edible to share.


If your meetings happen in a place that already serves food, like a coffee shop or restaurant, offering your own refreshments is unnecessary.

"
Know how many members to recruit.,
Ask your co-workers.,
Bring it up to your current business contacts.,
Mention the club to others in your general field.,
Spread the word through friends and family.,
Advertise.",How to Start a Business Book Club2," The ideal size for a business book club is about 10 to 12 people. Since most people will miss a meeting here or there, you will probably be short one or two people each meeting. Having fewer members may make it difficult to get an active discussion going, but having more members may make it equally difficult for everyone to chime in during the discussion.

, Unless you hate everyone at your office, the most sensible place to start is at your own place of work. Odds are, you know many of the people there well enough to determine if they would make a valuable addition to your book club. You also know that many of their business interests will line up with your own, especially if they work in your department.

, If you just signed a new client or are in the middle of pitching a new deal, refrain from mentioning your book club since it has nothing to do with the business between you and the other party. If you are on good terms—a “first name” basis—with contacts from partnering companies, however, you could consider telling them about your new business book club via e-mail or during non-office hours.

, You will want to keep the subjects discussed at your book club fairly focused, and the best way to do that is to make sure that your members are all interested in the same thing. For instance, if you work in sales, you will probably have different interests than someone who works in the IT department.

, Even if none of your friends or relatives share your vision or are in the same field of business, they may know someone who is. Tell your loved ones about your new book club and ask them to pass to word along to anyone they know who might be interested.

, Put an ad in the local paper or post one on a free classifieds website. You can also scour business blogs and message boards that have posters who live locally.

Decide what type of business books your club will focus on.,
Take requests.,
Peruse bestseller lists and business blogs.,
Pick out books in advance.,
Share your thoughts and ask questions.,
Encourage others to ask questions.",How to Start a Business Book Club3," There is a world of difference between books about starting your own business and books about climbing your way up the corporate ladder in an existing business. Likewise, someone interested in reading about improving sales may not be as interested in reading about how to manage subordinates. Decide what books your club will focus on before you start and let potential members know before they decide to join.

, Ask your members for book suggestions. As the leader, you can have the final say about whether or not each suggestion will be taken. Alternatively, you can put each request up for a vote or allow each member to take a turn selecting a book without taking any vote.

, The Internet is a valuable resource. Use it to find out about the business books that have grabbed the attention of professionals everywhere. If so many people are interested in a book, the information it contains may be worth adding to your own information bank.

, Instead of choosing the next book to read immediately before having to read it, determine a roster of books several months in advance. That way, members have plenty of time to research what the book is about and to grab a copy of it.

, As the leader of the group, it is your job to get the ball rolling. Mention a few key points you found interesting or a handful of ideas you feel skeptical about. Ask questions that cannot be answered with a simple “yes” or “no,” and offer opinions that are open enough to be debated.

, A business book club is not a lecture, after all. Make sure that anyone who has a question or idea has the opportunity to voice it. If your members are exceptionally quiet from meeting to meeting, you may consider twisting their arm a little by requesting that everyone bring at least one discussion question to each meeting.

"

Select the book you’ll be discussing.,
Choose a meeting place.,
Set the date and time.",How to Host a Book Club1," Book clubs use lots of different methods to choose new books. Typically, the book selected for the next club meeting is decided during the prior meeting.Books on the “100 Best Books” list of a major periodical are good choices, as are current bestsellers.
Consider both fiction and nonfiction when choosing a book.;
, Some book clubs can be hosted in your home. If your home is too small to host the book club, or if you simply don’t want to host the club meeting at your home, choose a communal location like a library conference room or a cafe.If you plan on hosting at a library, be sure to reserve a conference room well in advance of the book club meeting. You might not be able to get one at the last minute.

, If your book club has a regular meeting date and time (for instance, 8:00 every first Monday of the month), there’s no need to set the date and time. However, if the date and time of your book club varies, decide when the meeting will occur and let the club members know.There are many ways to let club members know when the next meeting will be. You could, for instance, call each of them with the information. You could also send a mass email containing the date and time.
If you prefer a more personal touch, you could mail out an invitation with the relevant information.

"
"
Designate a conversation leader.,
Look up some study questions for your book.,
Encourage club members to turn their phones off.,
Ask club members to write down questions or comments.,
Plan to socialize after you’ve discussed the book.",How to Host a Book Club2," The structure of each book club is a bit different, and there are no strict rules regarding how to designate a leader. In fact, some book clubs don’t have a leader at all. However, selecting a leader can help the conversation stay on topic and enrich the book club meeting.The book club’s host often doubles as the conversation leader.
You could also choose to invite a subject matter expert to lead the meeting. For instance, if you’re reading a book about the French Revolution, you might invite a local professor of French history to lead the conversation.
Alternately, your book club might decide to choose a single leader who runs every book club meeting.
English teachers, librarians, or authors often make good book club leaders.

, If you’re both the host and the conversation leader, having some questions about the book is crucial to keep the conversation focused and flowing. Even if you are not the conversation leader, though, having some questions ready to ask the group can make your meeting more enjoyable.If your book club is reading a well-known book, you’ll probably be able to find some study guides with questions in them online (or in book stores). For instance, if you’re reading 1984, you might run a search like ""1984 study questions” through your preferred search engine.
If you’re reading a book that doesn’t have questions available for it online, read the book carefully and come up with some open-ended questions that can elicit thoughtful reactions from club members.

, Phones can be a serious distraction from conducting an effective book club. Before the meeting begins, ask everyone kindly to turn their phones off. Use a friendly tone when doing so., At the beginning of the book club, hand everyone a pen or pencil and an index card. Encourage them to write a question or comment on an index card. Collect the cards before you get started, then read them out loud (or hand them to the conversation leader to read aloud). Invite responses to these questions and comments.Having book club participants write their thoughts on index cards can allow club members who are less outgoing to share their thoughts, too.
This is also a useful method for facilitating conversation on controversial books.

, Hosting and attending a book club should be fun, but some people like to use book club time to chat with friends. Include a designated social time at the end of the meeting for such off-topic conversations. That way, people who are there to talk and think more about the book get the opportunity to do so.If a club member is talking excessively and wandering off-topic, help them refocus their attention on the book with gentle but firm directions.
For instance, if someone is talking about their weekend plans instead of about what they think of the book, transition back to the conversation by saying “Let’s talk about the third chapter. Was anyone surprised by the protagonist’s decision?”

Select a theme for the book club.,
Find out what sort of snacks your group wants.,
Include some general book-themed decor.",How to Host a Book Club3," In addition to “regular” snacks like cheese and crackers, look for simple recipes that reflect the cuisine of a particular region, country or setting in the book. For example, if the story was set in Italy, you might serve bruschetta and Italian wine.Additionally, you could emphasize the theme of your club meeting by including some decor that evokes a character or setting from the book.For instance, if you’re reading Alice in Wonderland you could purchase some themed items (including coasters, candles, or decorative art) that refer to Alice and her adventures around the meeting space.
Don’t forget to offer some beverages to help wash down the snacks. Wine, water, coffee, tea, and soda are the easiest options.

, After deciding on the theme, ask for suggestions from book club members regarding what snacks they’d like, if any. If your meeting does not have a specific theme, simple snacks like crackers, cookies, and crisps are popular options.Some book clubs are happy without snacks of any kind. Others leave it to each group member to bring their own snacks. Still others leave it to the host to prepare snacks or hors d’oeuvres.
When hosting a book club, be sure to ask about food allergies and dietary preferences before preparing a snack.

, Instead of selecting a specific book-related theme for your book club meeting, you might want to introduce general book-centric paraphernalia to set the mood. If you’re hosting the club in your home, there are many options available for sprucing up a regular living room or other space with book club-themed items.For instance, you might be able to obtain pillow covers or pillows embroidered with images of books.
You could place some bookish art (such as art printed on book pages or paintings of people reading) around the meeting space.

Decide on your requirements.,
Find a location for the initial meeting.,
Make and distribute a flyer.This announces the time and place of the first meeting and any other relevant information, such as whether refreshments will be served.,
Prepare a clipboard.,
Prepare the meeting space.,
Greet the potential members at the first meeting.,
Start the first meeting by stating the agenda and making introductions.,
Explain or decide how often, for how long, and where the group will meet and how much reading the group should generally get through from meeting to meeting.,
Decide on the first book to read.,
Make sure that you decide on a name by the end of the first meeting.,
Break out the refreshments and chat.",How to Start a Book Group," You should definitely allow the group to make most decisions, but if you have certain requirements for the club (for example, if you just like to read science fiction or if you can only meet on Thursdays), you should set them out ahead of time.;
, If you feel comfortable inviting people into your home, you can have at least the first meeting at your house or apartment as long as you have enough room. Otherwise, you can usually reserve space for free at community centers, libraries or churches, or you might try to get a bookstore to let you hold your meeting there. If you can find someplace convenient where you can hold regular meetings, the better.

, Ask that people bring suggestions of books to read. Deliver copies of the flyer to local bookstores, and put them up on community bulletin boards at grocery stores, churches, etc. You can also advertise online on the community pages of sites such as Craigslist. Be sure to clarify that the purpose of the group is to discuss books, not to order books together at a reduced price. (CAVEAT: Please be aware that broad advertising of book clubs can result in the occasional bad apple that can single-handedly ruin the discussion openness and tone. Do this with caution.)

, For the initial meeting, this should include at least two items: a ""Book Suggestions"" page, where members can write down titles they recommend for the group, and a ""Hosting and Refreshments"" page where members can sign up for a date that is convenient for them to take these responsibilities. You also want to record the attendees names and contact details. A head count is not sufficient. For subsequent meetings, you'll also want to include a ""Coming Soon"" page or the reading schedule for the next two or three meetings. This clipboard should make the rounds at every meeting. This ""clipboard"" should be placed online -- some sites offer book clubs that ability to post meeting dates/locations, sent automatic meeting reminders, and add sign-up sheets for discussion leaders and sign-up sheets for refreshments. An online clipboard also allows members to add online reading guides and connect to book reviews. Also, a member should be chosen to send out an email with all the information on the clipboard; like what the next book will be, what was discussed, possible book club names, etc.

, Make sure the meeting space is clean and inviting. Check to make sure the restrooms are properly stocked. Most importantly, make sure you have enough chairs, and set up refreshments.

, Introduce yourself and try to make sure that each guest feels welcome and comfortable. Let them know you're glad to see them.

, If some of your guests don't know each other, go around and have everybody introduce themselves. You may also want to do this at subsequent meetings if new members are in attendance. Ask that people tell the group a little bit about themselves and their reading interests. During the introductions, send the clipboard around so people can write down book suggestions and sign up to bring refreshments or, if necessary, to host.

, Some issues to discuss are:


Do you want to set rules about the books, such as pricing or content?
What are the members' expectations of the group, and what are their responsibilities as members?
What is the group's policy on smoking, pets, tardiness, and telephone calls during book discussions? Are members allowed to bring their children if they don't have a babysitter? Some will not mind if children are present, others will. The tone of a meeting is very different if children are present.
Can members bring a guest? Of course, this is the best way to build book club membership. Referrals and invitations from existing members minimize the aforementioned ""bad apple.""
Can new people join, or is there a limit to the group size? The ideal size is less than 10 -- otherwise, people just don't have an opportunity to discuss and contribute.

, The easiest way to do this is to simply pick a book yourself -- try to pick one, such as a current bestseller, with wide appeal -- but if you don't want to go out on a limb, you can decide as a group. Ask that members bring their own suggestions and any external reviews that may help inform other members of the book. During the meeting have members vote on the next three books -- which gives members some time to find and read the books.

, This will make the book club more official and members will feel like they really belong. Don't just hastily choose a name though. Have the members suggest ideas and everyone vote.

, Now that the really hard work is done, relax and let people talk and leave as they will. Be sure to speak to each person again so they feel more comfortable and invested in the group.

Move chronologically through the events.,
Use sensory detail and description.,
Finish with a moral or takeaway.,
Read the narrative out loud.,
Show the narrative to others.,
Revise the narrative for clarity and length.",How to Write a Personal Narrative," The personal narrative should focus on a specific event or moment that was memorable or made a big impression on you. It does not need to major moment as long as it feels memorable and important to you. The event could have seemed minor at the time but ended up being life changing for you.For example, you may write about your struggles with body image in high school and how you overcame them in adulthood. Or you may write about your disastrous 15th birthday party and how it affected your relationship with your mother.

, Personal conflict can be great fodder for a personal narrative. Think about any strained relationships in your life or any moments of major conflict that you have experienced. Explore the conflict in detail in the narrative.For example, you write a personal narrative about your complicated relationship with your birth mother. Or you may write about a conflict you have with a sport you play or a club you are a part of.

, Use a theme as a jumping off point for the narrative. Explore a theme or idea from your perspective. Consider how the theme applies to your life and your experiences thus far. Themes like poverty, isolation, sacrifice, and talent are all good options for a personal narrative.For example, you may explore a theme like poverty by writing about your family’s struggle with money and finances. You may write about having to defer college applications to work at your parent’s business to make ends meet for your family.

, Learn from good examples of the genre online and in print. Search for the top personal narratives online to see what a successful narrative looks like. Read and learn from these examples. You may read:


The Boys of My Youth by Jo Ann Beard

Slouching Towards Bethlehem by Joan Didion

Me Talk Pretty One Day by David Sedaris
The Lives section of The New York Times


, Begin the personal narrative by drawing the reader in with a strong opening sentence. Use rich description and detail in the opening. Start in action so the reader is grabbed right away and keeps reading.For example, the first line in the personal narrative by Tony Gervino is attention grabbing: “I was 6 when my brother John leaned across the kitchen table and casually whispered that he had killed Santa Claus.”, Ground the reader in the story by providing information on the main characters and the central conflict or theme. Tell the reader where the narrative is taking place and when it is taking place. Explain whether the story is about you and/or you and your relationship with someone else in your life.For example, in Tony Gervino’s essay, he sets the scene by providing setting, character, and narrative voice: “It was July 1973, we were living in Scarsdale, N.Y., and he was four years older than I was, although that seemed like decades.”

, Do not jump to different moments in time or move from a past event to a present event and then back again in the same paragraph. Go chronologically from event to event or moment to moment. This will make it easier for the reader to follow along with the narrative.For example, you may start with an event in childhood with your older sister and then move forward in time to the present day, focusing on you and your older sister as adults.

, Focus on how things smelled, sounded, tasted, felt, and looked in the scene. Paint a vivid picture for the reader so they feel immersed in the narrative. Try to describe moments in the narrative based on the speaker’s perspective.For example, you may describe the feeling of your mother’s famous lemon cake as “rich and zesty, with a special ingredient that to this day, I cannot identify.”

, Most personal narratives end with a reflection or analysis of the events. You may come up with a moral that you share with the reader based on your own experiences. Or you may leave the reader with a takeaway thought that illustrates what you learned from your experiences.For example, you may end a personal narrative about your complicated relationship with your troubled sister by ending on a recent memory where you both enjoyed each other’s company. You may leave the reader with a lesson you have learned about loving someone, even with all their messiness and baggage.

, Once you have finished a draft of the personal narrative, read it aloud to yourself. Listen to how the narrative sounds out loud. Notice if there are any awkward moments or unclear sentences. Circle or underline them so you can revise them later.

You can also try reading the narrative out loud to someone else so they can hear how it sounds. This can then make it easier for them to give you feedback.

, Ask a friend, peer, classmate, or family member to read the narrative. Pose questions to them about the style, tone, and flow of the narrative. Ask them if the narrative feels personal, detailed, and engaging.Be willing to accept feedback from others. Be open to constructive criticism as it will likely strengthen the narrative.

, Read over the narrative for any spelling, grammar, or punctuation errors. Review the narrative to make sure it is not too long, as personal narratives are usually short, no more than one to five pages long. You may also need to meet a specific length requirement if you are writing the personal narrative for a class."
