Remember to also write the due date on the pocket so the lendee remembers when it is due.

",How to Lend Books From a Home Library," This doesn't mean just looking around and jotting down the authors. Lets go about this systematically. Start in one area of your house (better yet get all of your books into one area). Bring up an Excel spreadsheet and lets get started!;
, Now this can be as detailed or general as you want it to be, but here are a few things to note down and how to do it.

, In different cells type the headings: Author(s), Title, Genre, and Summary. You could also add: Publication Date, Place of Publication, Publisher, and Subject (e.g. vampires, history, Russia, or anything else that you though was important in the book). After these headings add: Loaned to: and Loaned on: (with the date). These heading will help you: better understand what you like, what you have, and where it is.

, Looking at your collection with a critical eye. As you start filling in your spreadsheet, you can reflect on a few things: do you still want to keep this book or should you donate it/give it away, what was that book about (to write a quick summary), do you like a specific genera,...).


If you don't want to create your own catalog on Excel, you can use a number of software options available. A quick Google search of ""cataloging software"" will provide a number of options. In addition, some websites can allow you to catalog your books online and allow you many more options to share your opinions of your books with a large community of users.
Now you have a list or catalog of your books. Its time to start lending! Decide who you want to lend works to and for how long and off you go! Just remember to type their name into your new catalog along with the date that the book is due back.
If you don't want to use a computerized system, you could also add library cards to the books.

Set book selection rules.,
Decide on a meeting location.,
Set the atmosphere.,
Prep for the discussion.,
Choose rules on new members.",How to Create Rules for a Book Club1," In a discussion book club, the whole group reads the same book between each meeting, usually one per month. There are a couple ways to decide which books to read:


Let anyone propose a book, then have the club vote on the options. Try this if the members have a similar taste in books and don't want to explore new genres.
Let one member choose each book, rotating through the list. This is a good way to explore a variety of works.
Work your way through a list of books that have received a particular reward for quality (Pulitzer Prize, National Book Award), excellence within a genre (Nebula, Walter Scott Prize), or for qualities that lead to good discussion (Firecracker Alternate Book Award, banned book lists, or various book club lists).;
, One common solution is to rotate hosting duties. If not everyone has the ability to host, rotate between those that can, or find a meeting space in a church, library, or community center.


Cafes are a fun option, but they need to have plenty of space and a carefree policy toward noise.

, For many people, socializing is just as important as the discussion. This isn't a problem if everyone's on the same page. If you'd like a more serious discussion instead, set a couple rules to make that clear:


If your group tends to derail the discussion with unrelated conversation, divide the meetings into two parts. Start with casual chats, then move on to focused discussion at a certain time.
If you really want good debate, ask members not to show up unless they've read at least part of the book. This could go over poorly among close friends.

, People attend book clubs in their spare time, and most will not want to put in extra time between meetings. If you'd like to improve the quality of discussion, appoint a facilitator (yourself, or rotating among dedicated readers) to lead the meeting. This facilitator should prepare as follows:


Read a couple reviews and brief author bios.
Come up with a few discussion prompts.
Print out handouts with key passages or extra info (optional).

, If you want an intimate meeting for close friends, ask members to keep it that way. If you're interested in broader debates or meeting new people, ask members to invite friends. If you have a large meeting space, you could even advertise in your local community.

Ship the book.",How to Sell a Used Book on the Internet," There are a number of websites that allow you to list and sell your books online. Some specialize in textbooks, while others sell all sorts of books. For choosing the best fit for you, consider:



How much you have to pay the site: Some booksellers charge a flat fee per book, while others charge a commission on the selling price; still other charges a membership fee instead of, or in addition to, a commission. Shop around to find the best deal for your particular situation, and make sure you understand exactly how much you'll have to pay when your book sells.

The site's shipping policy: You'll have to ship the book when it sells, so make sure you understand any requirements for shipping. Most sites require that you ship via a tracking service, for example. Also, find out how shipping is factored into how much you get paid. Do you have to pay shipping out of the book's sale price, or is there a shipping allowance that's added to the price?

How you get paid: When someone buys a book, the website will pay you, usually either by direct deposit into your bank account, by PayPal, or by check. Some may pay you immediately, while many pay sellers once or twice a month.

How easy it is to list your book: Selling your book online is usually extremely easy. Once you have a seller account at a site, you may be able to simply enter the ISBN and the condition of your book and sell it without entering any additional information. That said, you may want to add more information, and on some sites your ability to do so is limited.

The reputation of the bookseller and the amount of exposure your book will get. Most big online booksellers have a good track record, and you can get comparable exposure at most of them, but do your due diligence.;
, Choose a site on which to sell your book, or choose a couple if, for example, you want to sell a specialty book and a more general book. You'll usually need to provide your bank account information and/or credit card number, so once again, make sure you feel comfortable with your choice.

, The ISBN is a 10-digit number--it will change to 13 digits in 2007--that identifies a particular title and edition. You can usually find it on the back of the book, near or on the UPC code, or on one of the first few pages of a book, where you can also find the copyright date and library classification information. The ISBN system has been used on all books sold internationally since the 1970s (that is to say, most books your will encounter).

, Enter the ISBN (without dashes) into the search bar of the online bookseller you've chosen. You may also want to get a comparison of prices at other booksellers, either by searching them yourself or by using a free service such as bookprice24.com or addall.com. If your book doesn't have an ISBN, search by author or title.

, In general, set your price about equal to the price that other copies of that book in comparable condition are going for. If you want to make a really quick sale, set your price lower than any other comparable copies; if you just want to get the best price you can and aren't concerned about how long it will take to sell (or if the book is in very high demand), set your price a bit higher. Also consider your expenses (i.e. shipping and commission) and your time when setting the price. Sometimes it just isn't worth it to sell the book if you can't get a decent price.

, Follow the directions on the site on which you've chosen to list the book. You probably won't need to enter much information, and there will also likely already be a picture of the book on the site. If you have relevant information or a picture you'd like to add, go ahead, but don't spend too much time on it.

, Books in high demand, such as current textbooks and bestsellers, may sell on the same day you list them. Other books may take days, weeks, or months to sell (there's no guarantee you'll sell a book at all). Be patient, and consider lowering your price, revising your listing, or listing the book on another site if you feel like it's taking too long.

, When the book sells, you'll get a notification email from the site with the buyer's address. Ship the book promptly within the allotted time frame and via the shipping method that the buyer selected.

Look at a bestseller list.,
Ask for a recommendation.,
Visit a few expert websites dealing with book clubs and book reviews.,
Find out what other book clubs are reading.,
Pick a book you have already read and enjoyed.,
Pick a book that goes with the theme of your book club.,
Most importantly, don't stress yourself.",How to Choose a Book for a Book Club," These books become bestsellers because people mutually liked them. It is possible that your fellow book club members will too. Make sure you don't choose a book just because it's famous- books become famous for being bad, too. Choose a book you like, and you think others will like too.;
, Get some advice from people whose taste in books you agree with. Ask a fellow group member for some tips. Allow each group member to suggest a title and put the list to a vote.

, www.goodreads.com is a great site, where you can both enter an online book club and seek their opinions, or read through reviews of books from various people around the world.


Many publisher web pages provide suggestions for book groups, as well as reading guides with discussion questions. Enter one of these discussions, ask people for help.
Check out online book clubs. If you are an introvert-type, you might find it easier to ask people for recommendations through a screen and not face-to-face. Most groups keep lists of previously discussed books with reviews.


, If you have friends in different book clubs, ask them for previously read books in their clubs. Get their opinions and recommendations.

, The best books can be read over and over. Remember, just because you love it, doesn't mean everyone else will. Keep that in mind, and choose a book that might fit to everyone's taste.

, Science-fiction, thriller, romance, mystery - what is the theme your book club has chosen for the month? Go with that theme. It narrows down your choices, and makes it easier for you to pick one book.

, You're only choosing a book for a club. If people don't like your choice, it doesn't matter. You can always keep it in mind the next time you get to choose. Be content with your choice."

Come up with a member list.,
Set rules for book acquisition.,
Decide where and when to meet.,
Write down the loan policy.,
Set a return schedule.,
Assign a member to track the loans.",How to Create Rules for a Book Club2," This type of book club gathers a collection of books for its members to borrow. The more people you invite, the larger and more interesting your library. That said, for logistics reasons you may want to start with ten people or fewer.

, There are two common ways this type of club can function:


Each member loans the club 1-3 books each meeting.
Alternatively, each member donates a certain amount of money each meeting. The host for that month (a rotating position) spends the money to buy books for the club to enjoy.

, Unless you have a communal space to store the books, the book club usually only borrows or returns books once every month or two. This is also a good chance to trade recommendations and socialize.


It's usually easiest to have one person store the book collection and host the meetings, so you don't have to transport the books. Consider putting out a donation box to reimburse this host for his time.

, Here are a few suggested rules to keep the club running smoothly:


Each member can borrow one book at a time.
Each book is due back after a certain amount of time (such as two months).
Set a small fine for late books, to be put in a communal fund for snacks or similar expenses.
Set a larger fine for lost or damaged books, to be given to the original owner of the book.

, For space reasons, most clubs won't want to keep their collection growing endlessly. After a book has been around for a certain period of time (say 6 to 12 months), return it to its original owner or purchaser.

, One person should be responsible for a document that lists every book in the collection, with the following information:


Who currently has the book (if anyone).
When the book is due back in the collection.
The original owner/purchaser.
When the book is due to return to the original owner/purchaser.

Lovely stationery can be inspiring, if you're the ""I like to hoard stationery"" type. Don't neglect the value of texture, aroma and vibrancy of good quality writing materials. They can provide the encouraging kick you need to sit down and write.
Don't neglect the value of audio either. Perhaps you prefer talking your book into a microphone as you pace or go for a hike. There is no right or wrong here. If that works for you, then do it. If you're really lucky, you might even have someone willing to take dictation for you or copy across your spoken notes.;
, For many people, this means choosing a spot, such as a study with a window view, or a cozy nook somewhere. For others, it means moving about often, visiting cafes and sitting under trees. Work out what combination of writing spaces works out best for you and arrange for it to happen.

, Do you enjoy romance novels? Vampires? Fantasy? Horror? If you like any of those topics, write about one. You could put romance and horror into one, or vampires and romance together, like Twilight.


If you're keen on non-fiction, that's a possibility too, although it won't be covered by this article.

, Jot down a title if you can––may be a source of inspiration. However, it's not essential at this stage. If the title just isn't coming to you, skip this step and wait for the story itself to suggest a title to you.


Think of a key image you may want to convey. For instance, in ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", the mockingbird is mentioned only a few times, but because it was mentioned in the title, it has a greater meaning than it normally would.

, First, you'll need to get some inspiration. Reading books about the subject you're writing about may help you to come up with a list of inspiring ideas for your own writing. Use such material to get yourself thinking about stories and plots and what you're writing about.

, Go into a dark and silent room (it's best when you're home alone), stuff your face into a pillow, and just think. Bring a notebook, and whatever comes to your mind, write it down. (Or speak it into that audio machine.)

, Once you have several good ideas you like, it's time to work on plotting. Take your favorite idea, and work with it. Develop a plot an an outline, characters, and never forget to always put in crazy plot twist. Keep your readers on the edge of their seats.


If you're looking for a program that will help with outlining, Scrivener is a useful writing program that helps with outlining.

, Think about what you're writing about. If it's about animals, spend time around the animal you're writing about (or, any animal), and study it, and how it acts. As for researching it, look it up, read books about it, and so forth. This can only do you good. Say you're writing about some brainiac computer people who code websites and games and stuff. In that case, learn everything about computers that you can, learn the code language they use, and so on.

, This is the really fun part.


Name the characters. A name can be anything. It can be random gibberish you make (put together letters you like), the meaning can have something to do with the story, or, it can simply be a name that sounds pretty, to you.
Once you have your name, start visualizing your character. What do they look like? What do they talk like? What do they like to do? And, the most important, and hardest question: What are they like? What's their personality? Personalization (the art of making personalities for characters) is both fun, and, hard.
Don't make them too much like you. They have to have faults. They have to be really unique.

, For the first line of your novel, make it as unique is possible. Avoid totally clichéd lines that people have used so many times who knows who started them, such as ""it was a dark and stormy night"". Make it as perfect as possible.


Tip: The first sentence should have something to do with the ending. It's really cool when books start and end with the same something (same first and last line, same place, etc.).
Remember you have to please the first-line-judgers (first-line-judger: noun. a person who judges a book, not by its cover, but, by its first line).
Or, ignore the rules and be a good author by following what you know works.

, Don't be afraid to change a few things. Write more and more, every day, until you have a consistent word count going every day (maybe 1,000?).

, One excellent way is to join National Novel Writing Month. National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo) is a writing challenge, you have to reach 50,000 words, in the month of November. It's something you can do, even adults with a full-time job and it's also suitable for children.


Look it up at nanowrimo.org. If it's anywhere near November, I sign up for NaNoWriMo. 1,667 words a day keeps you on speed track.
If you're nowhere near November, you can always sign up for Camp NaNoWriMo (campnanowrimo.org). Camp NaNoWriMos are in April, June, and July.
If you're not close to any of those months, and don't feel like waiting for them, you can do your own NaNoWriMo. Organized one with your friend. Still try to get 50k words, but, also, try to beat their word counts!

, Spend a whole month working on your typing speed. Measure it in wpm. Typingtest.com is a great site for testing it.

, Schedule each day, before you go to sleep, and leave several hours aside for writing. Take advantage of the weekends and any spare time.


Don't update your word count every 5 minutes; though it will be very hard to resist it, it wastes time.

, Then pick up the writing again and aim to complete it. Writing can be fun, but if you start to feel bored or want to do something else, write again later. If you aren't in the mood, your story won't be as great as you want it to be.

, It's easier to read, and makes the story seem much more professional.

, If you enjoy it, it'll be completed much faster.

, It's not that hard, and it's not like many people say it is. Editing is perfecting. Perfect your novel. Fix grammar and typing mistakes, root for and fix plot holes, change anything necessary, and, unnecessary, and make it as perfect as possible. Stick to one or two revisions only, and you'll save years of time. Just be ruthless when you do it.


Leave it alone for a week or so. Don't forget to go back to it, after a week, though. The first step to editing is reading through your novel. Print it out, and grab your tools (a pencil, a highlighter, and something to look stuff up on). Read it over, however many times you want. Highlight anything you think you need to change, make little notes with your pencil on the margin, and get your novel ready to edit on the computer.
Go to your computer. With your novel beside you, read over your novel, changing and perfecting. Go through it several times.

, Always take criticism kindly. It's only to help you. Email your work to friends and family, print it out and send them copies, and have them give you critiques. You can publish samples of it on author sites for help, too. Once you're done getting feedback, write all your notes down.

, Make any further changes you think are necessary, and perfect it more.

, Search up book editors online that will take copies of novel. When you've found a suitable editor, send it to them. Take their feedback, and fix anything. When they say it's good, now it's time for a publisher.

, The first step is to look up good publishers. Here is what to look for in a publisher:


Do they publish books you like?
Do their published books often have mistakes? (Typos, missing pages/pages out of order, etc.)
Do they publish books in your book's genre/age level?
Will they publish your book if you don't have an agent?
Are they well-known?

, Once you've found a few publishers you're absolutely certain you like, send in your novel to your top 30. Be prepared for rejection, a lot of publishers are picky about what they publish. Don't take rejection too hard, either. It's bound to happen at least once, even with the greatest novel. Harry Potter was rejected seven times, before it was accepted.Don't be afraid to try many publishers at once; the first one to accept it gets it!

, If that doesn't work out, at least you wrote a novel!

Always submit your best work.",How to Write a Book Review," If possible, read the book multiple times, as repeat reads tend to lead a reader (or reviewer) to view aspects of the story, the setting and the character(s) in a new or different way.


Write down your notes or use a voice recorder to document any thoughts or impressions you have of the book as you are reading. They don't have to be organised or perfect, the idea is to brainstorm any impressions you may have of the book.

, Consider how the book fits or does not fit in it's genre or field of study. If necessary, use outside sources to familiarize yourself with the field of study and the genre of the book.


For example, if you are reviewing a non-fiction book about the development of the polio vaccine in the 1950s, consider reading other books that also examine the same scientific issue and period of scientific development. Or if you are reviewing a work of fiction like Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter, consider how Hawthorne's book relates to other works of romanticism and historical fiction set in the same time period (the 17th century) as points of comparison.

, The theme is often a lesson or overall message that the reader perceives between the lines. The theme can also be the fundamental and often universal ideas explored in a book. Authors may present multiple themes in their writing, especially works of fiction.


Pay attention to the preface, any quotes, and /or references in the book's introduction, as this content will likely shed light on the book's major themes and viewpoint.
A simple way to determine one of the major themes of a book is to sum up the book in one word.So, for example, the major theme of The Scarlet Letter could be ""sin"". Once you have your one word summary, stretch the single word into a message or lesson, such as ""sin can lead to knowledge but it can also lead to suffering.""

, Ask yourself if the style suits the book's intended audience. Remember that genre is a category of writing and style is the manner in which a subject is expressed or performed. So, depending on the style used, the author can present different viewpoints to the intended audience.


For example, in The Scarlet Letter, Hawthorne attempts to combine the writing style of the Romantic Period (1800-1855) with the common, every day language of the American Puritans of the 1600s. Hawthorne does this with long, descriptive sentences that are strung together with commas and semi-colons, and he also uses antiquated word choices and descriptors that are rooted in the Romantic period and in Puritan terms inspired by the Bible., What areas are covered/not covered? Why? Locating gaps in the timeframe or character development of the book can help you think critically. As well, noticing any well developed elements of the book will help you create good points for your review.

, Elements like the book's layout, binding, typography, etc. can provide framing and context for the book. If the author provides secondary material like maps, charts, and drawings, always consider how they support or contribute to the book's themes.


In the Scarlet Letter, for example, Hawthorne begins the book with an introduction to the text, narrated by an individual who has many autobiographical details in common with the author. In the introduction, the nameless narrator tells the story of finding the manuscript bundled in a scarlet letter ""A"". Hawthorne uses this narrative framing to create a story within a story, an important detail when discussing the book as a whole.

, If the book is a work of fiction, think about how plot structure is developed in the story. Take notes on the book's character, plot, setting, symbols, mood or tone and how they relate to the overall theme of the book.


If we were to use the Scarlett Letter again, it would be important to note that Hawthorne chose the adulterer and sinner Hester Prynne as his protagonist, and placed the religious, anti sin Reverend Wilson in the role of antagonist. In writing a review of The Scarlet Letter, it would be useful to consider why Hawthorne did this, and how it relates back to the book's overall theme of sin.

, Does it add new information to a genre? The author may be trying to challenge or expand the existing rules and norms of a genre. Consider how the book does this, and how this may affect the intended audience's reception of the book.

, Was the author successful in carrying out the overall purposes of the book and did you feel satisfied with the book's ending? Would you recommend this book to others?

, Most reviews start off with a heading that includes all the bibliographic information about the book. If you haven't been directed on heading format from an editor or professor, use the standard heading of: title, author, place of publication: publisher, date of publication, and number of pages. , A good introduction will grab the reader's attention so they are interested in reading the rest of the review, and will inform the reader what the review is going to be about.Ensure your introduction contains relevant details like the author's background, and if applicable, their previous work in the genre. You can also indicate the main themes you will be discussing in your review to situate the reader and give them an indication of your ""take"" on the book.
Several possible openings include: a historical moment, an anecdote, a surprising or intriguing statement, and declarative statements.Regardless of your opening sentences, make sure they directly relate to your critical response to the book and keep them short and to the point.
If you're unsure on how to begin the review, try writing your introduction last. It may be easier to organize all of your supporting points and your critical position, and then write the introduction last—that way you can be sure that the introduction will match the body of the review., Once you have established your heading and your introduction, you can then move into a summary of the book's themes and main points.


Keep the summary short, to the point, and informative. Use quotes or paraphrasing from the book to support your summary.Make sure you properly cite all quotes and paraphrasing in your review to avoid plagiarism.Be wary of summaries that begin with phrases like “is about…” “is the story of…” “writes about…”.Focus on weaving a description of the book's setting, narrative voice, and plot within a critical analysis. Avoid simply regurgitating the book's premise.
Don't give away important details or reveal the ending of the book in your summary, and don't go into detail about what happens from the middle of the book onwards. As well, if the book is part of a series, you can mention this to potential readers and situate the book within the series. , Once you have summarized the book and discussed the main themes and aspects, shift into your critical analysis. This the heart of your review, so be as direct and clear as you can.


Use the answers you brainstormed during your preparation for the review to formulate your critique. Address how well the book has achieved its goal, how the book compares to other books on the subject, specific points that were not convincing or lacked development, and what personal experiences, if any, you've had related to the subject of the book.Always use (properly cited) supporting quotes and passages from the book to back up your critical discussion. This not only reinforces your viewpoint with a trustworthy source, it also gives the reader a sense of the writing style and narrative voice of the book.The general rule of thumb is that the first one-half to two-thirds of the review should summarize the author’s main ideas and at least one-third should evaluate the book., Write a concluding paragraph or several sentences that sum up your critical analysis of the book. If your critical position has been well argued, the conclusion should follow naturally.


Examine the strengths and weaknesses of the book, and discuss whether or not you would recommend the book to others. If so, who do you think is the ideal audience for the book?Do not introduce new material in your conclusion or discuss a new idea or impression that was not examined in your introduction and body paragraphs.You can also give the book a numerical score, a thumbs up or thumbs down, or a starred rating., Your first stab at a book review may not be as perfect as you'd like, so feel free to revise and adjust your draft. To gain perspective, put the review aside for a few days and then come back to it with fresh eyes.


Always use spell check and adjust any grammar or spelling. Nothing undermines a quality review more than bad spelling and grammar.
Double check that all quotes and references are properly cited in your review.

, If possible, get someone else to read the review before you submit it to an editor or turn it in to a professor. It is difficult to edit and critique your own work, so ask a friend to read your review and then tell you if they felt the introduction grabbed their attention and if your critical discussion was consistent and developed throughout your review.

, Make sure you incorporate your revisions and any feedback you have received to create the best final draft. A good review will flow well from introduction to summary to critical analysis, have an interesting perspective on the book, and be free of any grammatical or spelling errors to ensure it is easy to read.

You will be cutting into the book with a sharp knife, and there's a chance that it will go through the book and onto your table., You must remove the back and front cover before you can start removing the pages. Open the book and use a utility knife to cut along the inside binding of the book. If it's a hardcover book, you'll have to apply a good amount of pressure to go through the cover. Once you've made your cuts, pull away the front cover of the book.The interior fold is where the front cover and back cover of the book connect to the rest of the pages.
Be careful and cut away from your body.

, Flip the book over and make a straight cut down the binding of the book. Pull the back cover away so that it's no longer connected to the pages of the book. Again, you may have to apply a considerable amount of pressure to cut all the way through the book., Sometimes there will be threads inside of the book spine. Carefully pull the spine away from the book pages. Use a set of tweezers to carefully pull them out. Continue pulling them until there are no more threads in the spine. If you pull all of the threads, the pages should start to come loose.If you are unbinding a softcover book, you can skip this step because they typically use a glue adhesive to keep the pages together.

, Open the book to the middle page so that the text on the pages are facing you. Use a razor blade and carefully cut down the center of the book. This should detach both sides of the book. You may have to apply considerable pressure to get all the way through the binding., Sometimes the pages will just begin to detach if you've cut down the center of the book. If they don't, open the book page by page and cut down the binding to fully remove them."
"
Lay the book down on the edge of a flat surface.,
Apply pressure to the cover of the book.,
Pull the spiral binding down.",How to Unbind a Book2," Laying the book down on the edge of a flat edge will give you leverage on the binding and allow you to pull out the coil in one motion. The books binding should be slightly hanging over the edge of your flat surface., Use your body weight to press down on the cover of the cover of the book, with the spiral binding hanging over your flat surface. This will keep the book still as you pull out the spiral binding., Place your thumb on the spiral binding in the center of the book. While still applying pressure to the cover, quickly pull down on the coil. This should unwind it on both sides and remove it from the book. Because the plastic coils are fairly flexible, you shouldn't have to adjust them if you pull the coil out with enough force."
"
Bend the end of the spiral binding with pliers.,
Remove any detachable pages.,
Rotate the coil and work it out of the binding.",How to Unbind a Book3," Hold the book firmly in your hands and use a set of needle nose pliers to straighten out the bent binding on the bottom of the book. The coil, which looked like a hook, should now be straight., If you don't want to save the front or back cover of the book, you can remove them by simply pulling them out. Remove any detachable pages inside of your book to make it easier to remove the coil., Use your fingers to push and rotate the coil. It should start to unwind on the other side and exit on the top of the book. Continue spinning until the entire coil is detached."

Plan the initial design of the cover.,
Choose text fonts and sizes from the options provided.,
Add images for flare.,
Clean finish and minor changes.,
To finish the cover, simply open the PP to full screen, make sure that the PP transparent function box disappears and then copy the screen by using PrtScn.,
Edit the image size to work well with your cover design.",How to Use PowerPoint to Create a Book Cover," Before getting into the low tech method of creating the book cover, a plan, an idea should already be laid out and carefully set for the cover graphics and design. How it will look, placing of the words and any images to be incorporated into the book cover.


Be prepared. Have all of the images or different designs picked out and ready to use. Waiting to get images while creating book cover bogs down the process and can create confusion – there should be a set plan in motion, changes can be added later but only after you already accomplished your plan.
The most important program necessary to accomplish this is Microsoft’s PowerPoint presentation program. MS Word and MS Paint or another image editing program will also be required.;
, What type of font will be use for the text portion of the cover. The title of the book should have already been decided upon and a desired look by now is established through a trial and error staging process. All that needs to be done is to use the text tools to make the vision a reality. It may take some ""playing"" and tweaking to make it look exactly as envisioned.


Remember to change the PowerPoint panel from its landscape view to portrait view to get the desired look. This will help with the next few steps in creating the book cover.

, Also add to the cover interesting images, depending on the over all look would be helpful but remember not to overwhelm the appearance of cover. Adding images can be done by simply using the insert function of MS PowerPoint to insert images easily. Images should be formatted in the GIF form in order to utilize the transparency feature in the image editing program or in the MS PowerPoint program.


Edit the image(s) to achieve the optimal look. This is where a bit of editing knowledge will come in handy. Most image editing programs have a feature that allows you to make the background of images transparent. (So does the MS PowerPoint program.) With a bit of practice you can incorporate images seamlessly into the cover.

, Once you’ve accomplish the look you want for your book cover you can clean up the image as a whole or make minor changes to improve the finished look of the cover. Try to avoid making too many changes and be smart – create a copy and alter copy so if an error occurs, nothing is lost.

, Then open MS Paint and paste the image to MS Paint. All that is needed to do now is to crop the picture to desired look and to save as a PNG file.


After the image is saved it can be opened in any image editing program. Change the resolution of the image to 300 DPI. This will ensure the needed print quality and will reduce fading when printing.

, The final step for book cover creation is to edit the size of the image to fit your book. For example if the book size is 6.2"" X 8.28"", then that is the size the image should be formatted. Doing so will help when you go to publish your book and it has to fit in a standard format to match the book print size. Save the file in the format specified by your publisher. Some companies only accept certain file formats for uploading a book cover image.

Draw on your life experience.,
Jot down story ideas.,
Connect a story idea to a message.,
Don’t make it all about you.",How to Tell Better Stories1," The most meaningful stories convey a message by relating it to an actual series of events. Illustrating a point by relating it to your own experiences will impart a personal, authentic quality. Draw on funny happenings, barriers you overcame, or lessons you learned.True stories are great for illustrating a message, but don’t fret if fiction is your forte. Telling a more imaginative tale still involves the same strategies, like sticking to a clear structure and delivering your story effectively.;
, Keep a journal to log your story ideas when they come to you. Try to keep one handy at all times so an idea never escapes you. Even if you just jot down a quick sentence or thought, you can return to it later and use it to craft a great story., A great story has a point. If you’re making a speech or trying to motivate a team, think of the moral of your story, or the point you’re trying to make. Look through your idea journal or think of a life experience that connects to that message.For example, if you’re trying to inspire your employees or coworkers to meet a deadline, you’d want to tell them a story that illustrates perseverance despite tough obstacles. You could convey that moral by recalling a time they succeeded as a team in the past despite the odds being against them.

, No one likes to hear a person go on and on about how wonderful they are. While it’s best to draw on your own experiences, try to make the hero of your stories someone other than you.For example, stories in which you play a major role could involve you learning something from a mentor or making a mistake. That way, your story will be more authentic, you’ll engage your audience by making yourself vulnerable, and you won’t seem like you’re just boasting.

"
"
Follow a clear structure.,
Match the length of a story to the setting.,
Make the opening and closing memorable.,
Add engaging details.,
Practice telling your story.",How to Tell Better Stories2," Whether you’re telling a story at a cocktail party or a job interview, it should follow a logical structure. A good structure allows the audience to easily follow along and has a rhythm that engages them in the action. To stick to a clear structure, you should:Start with an introduction to set your story’s scene.
Describe the inciting incident, which presents the challenge or conflict.
Raise the stakes and add a personal connection by adding context and detail to the challenge.
Proceed to the climax, or your story’s main event
Finish with the resolution, which is when you can reflect on the moral of your story.

, There’s no ideal story length, and the appropriate length will depend on the time and place that you're telling the story. However, you should generally limit your stories to a few minutes. Stick to your story’s structure, avoid getting too verbose or complicated, and try not to go off on tangents.For example, if you pass by a coworker and tell them a story, you'll probably want to limit it to around a minute. Imagine if someone in an elevator with you started telling a long story, didn't finish it when the doors opened on your floor, and held you up until they were done.
On the other hand, guests at a dinner party are there to socialize and talk, so you can make your stories longer and more engrossing.

, A good opening will grab your audience’s attention. Start off on the right foot by telling your best joke, asking them a question, or introducing your moral or message. When concluding your story, bring it back to the beginning to help the audience understand the journey you’ve described.Suppose you're telling some friends about the time your boss took you out to lunch and, on the way to the restaurant, drove through a puddle that soaked you through your open window. You could open by saying, ""Have you ever wondered what your boss really thinks of you? One rainy afternoon, I found out the hard way that I'm a lot less precious than a leather auto interior.""
Wrap your story up by saying something like, ""And there I am, shivering like a wet dog and soaked in dirty, side-of-the-road water, and all my boss can say is, 'Quick! Grab something to wipe the seats!'""

, The right details will capture your audience’s interest, place them in the action, and bring your story to life. However, make sure you don’t bore them by providing tedious details in each sentence.For example, “That evening, deep in summer’s dog days, was thick with muggy Coastal Georgia heat,” is a more engaging detail than, “It was uncomfortably hot and humid on the night of August 26, 2016.”  

, Great storytellers might seem like they’re improvising on the spot. However, telling a great story is an art form, and practice makes perfect.Try saying the story to yourself first. Then tell it to various groups of people and work on parts that didn’t seem to go over so well. Just make sure you don’t tell the same story to the same people!"
"
Know your audience.,
Make comfortable eye contact.,
Try not to seem robotic.,
Use your voice to make your story more engaging.",How to Tell Better Stories3," You probably wouldn’t tell a story that deals with delicate topics at a job interview. Likewise, your friends might find a story about your professional accolades boring and self-congratulatory. Keep your audience in mind and tell them a story that appeals to their interests.Save stories about wild nights, sensitive political or social topics, and other potentially inappropriate content for good friends. At work or with people you don't know well, keep your stories PG, or as least likely to offend someone as possible.
For example, you could tell a new coworker about the time the software went down at the worst possible moment and, despite the chaos that ensued, somehow it seems hysterical in retrospect.

, Maintaining comfortable eye contact will help you come off as authentic and believable. However, you should find the right balance. Look at someone for a few seconds, then make eye contact with the next person.Glancing between people or shifting your eyes too much can seem untrustworthy.
Looking away and not making any eye contact is also suspicious.
Holding eye contact with one person for too long can make them uncomfortable.

, While you should rehearse your story, try not to deliver your story as if you were reading off a script. Practice your speech, but make your deliver seem off the cuff instead of stale. Instead of trying to be perfect, give yourself some room to improvise., When you speak as a character in your story, use a different voice to make it clear the character is speaking and not the narrator. At tense or serious points, try lowering your volume and slowing your delivery to put your listeners on the edges of their seats. Quicken your pace and increase your volume to communicate action and energy."

Read as many short stories as you can.,
Understand the components of a short story.,
Reflect on the story you want to write.,
Start with your intuition.,
Start with a compelling flashback.,
Start with a strong declarative statement.,
Start with characterization.,
Introduce the stakes of the story.,
Develop the setting.,
Avoid the pitfalls of short story openings.,
Reflect on what you've written.,
Ask for an outside opinion.",How to Start a Story," Though you can write your own short story whenever you want, you'll be able to write more effectively if you have read a wide variety of short stories, from classics to contemporary pieces. Once you've read enough short stories, you'll have a better sense of the elements of a short story, and a deeper understanding of what will appeal to an audience. Pick your favorite stories and pay attention to how they start. See what works and doesn't work in an opening.


Read the short stories of classic writers such as Edgar Allan Poe, Anton Chekhov, and Guy de Maupassant.
Read the short stories of writers from the earlier part of the 20th century, such as Isaac Babel, Ernest Hemingway, Flannery O'Connor, or Jorge Luis Borges.
Read the short stories of more contemporary masters of the short story, such as Alice Munro, Raymond Carver, and Jhumpa Lahiri.
Join a writing workshop, either in school or in your community, and read the works of other writers who are still honing their craft. Sometimes, the works of true masters can be overwhelming, and reading the work of writers who are starting out can make you feel like your task is more surmountable.

, Your amazing opening won't work if you don't know how to follow it up with a strong middle and end. Though short stories vary in their narration and subject matter, and some stories are traditional while others take a more experimental track, you should be aware of the key aspects of a good short story:


Plot. The plot is ""what happens"" in a story. Stories that are plot-driven are heavily dependent on what happens next, such as the detective stories of Poe. Some short stories follow the pattern of having rising action, a crisis, and falling action, while others start in the middle of a crisis, or end with a crisis without telling the reader what happens next.

Your plot doesn't have to be as structured like a detective story, but there should always be a sense that there is something at stake, whether it's whether a character can come to understand that her husband is unfaithful, or if a character can win a much-anticipated spelling bee to please her father.


Character. Your story should have at least one character that your readers can care about and root for. Typically, your character should be sympathetic so your characters can better understand his motives, but if the character is original, well-realized, and fascinating, your readers will love reading about him whether he's sympathetic or not.
Dialogue. Dialogue can be considered the poetry in the prose and should be used sparingly to convey a character's voice. However, there some writers, such as Hemingway or Carver, who write excellent stories that are very heavy in dialogue.
Point-of-view. Point of view is the perspective that the story is told from. It can be told in the first person, second person, or third person. First person is directly from the perspective of a character, second person addresses the reader as ""you,"" and third person creates a distance between the narrator and the characters.
Setting is where and when the story takes place. Setting can be crucial to a story, such as the setting of the Southern works of William Faulkner, or it can play a more minor role.

, Though there are many different ways to write, it will help to take some time to consider the story you have in mind. Maybe you were inspired by something you saw, or have always been fascinated by a strange story about your grandfather's childhood. Whatever your reason for writing the story, it can help to ask yourself a few questions before you begin:


Will your story work better in the first, second, or third person? Though you can experiment with these perspectives once you begin writing, thinking about which point of view will be more appropriate in advance can help you start strong.
Where and when will your story take place? If your story will take place in a town you don't know much about, or in a time period that you don't know very well, you may have to do some research before you can begin to write your story with confidence.
How many characters will there be in your story? If you have a sense of the main players in your story, you'll have a better understanding of how long and detailed the story should be.
Don't underestimate the power of writing without a plan. If you're inspired, just put a pen to paper and see what happens. If trying to plan out your story before you start bogs you down, just dive right in and figure out the details as you go along.

, Relax and write the first thing that comes to mind. You don't have to figure out which character or form of narration you'll be using. Just start writing without stopping to think for a few minutes and see what happens.


Write for at least ten minutes without stopping. Once you're done, you should read over what you've written to see how your opening sounds, or to see if you can find a good starting point somewhere in the pages you've filled.
Don't stop to correct your work for grammar or punctuation. This may slow you down and will make you self-conscious about your ideas. You can perfect your writing later.

, Though flashbacks take the risk of being sentimental or confusing the reader, they can draw the reader in, and make your reader wonder about how the story moved from the past to the present.


Pick a moment that was memorable to a character. It can be a truly dramatic moment in the character's life, or it can be a significant memory that is developed later in the story.
If you choose to start with a flashback, make sure that your readers know when you've transitioned into the present, or you will lose or confuse them.
Start with a moment when a character acts in a surprising way. Move to the present, and leave your reader to wonder why the character would have acted this way.

, Don't be afraid to start with a bold voice that says a lot about the main character and tells the reader what to expect in the rest of the story. The opening of a story sets the terms of the story and helps the reader interpret the events that take place, so a clear, bold statement can help hook your readers.


Melville's novel Moby Dick simply starts with the statement ""Call me Ishmael."" From there, the narrator talks of his love of sea voyages, and about how much the ocean means to him. This statement draws the reader in and makes him feel more comfortable with the main character. Though this is the opening of a novel, it would work just as well for a short story.
Amy Bloom's story, ""The Story,"" opens with the line, ""You wouldn't have known me a year ago."" This simple-but-direct opening draws in the reader and makes him want to know more about this character, and why this character has changed.
Chekhov's ""Lady With a Little Dog"" begins with the statement, ""It was said that a new person had appeared on the sea front: a lady with a little dog."" This story continues to discuss Gurov, another guest on the sea front, who begins to take an interest in this woman, and eventually delves into their passionate love affair. The statement is simple yet effective, and leaves the reader wanting to know more about this woman.
The right line of dialogue can also grab your readers and provide insight into the person who is saying it, but be aware that starting a story with a line of dialogue is tricky.

, Your character doesn't have to speak to the reader right away. Instead, you can let your reader see your character in action, to show the kind of person your character is and what is at stake for him or her in the story. Here are some ways to start with characterization:


Begin with your character's quirk. Maybe your character likes to eat a meal with two forks, or maybe your character showers with his shoes on. Tell your readers what makes your character unique.
Reveal what your character is thinking. Invite your readers into your character's head to let them know whether she's wondering about the gender of her baby, or worried about her mother's new memory lapses.
Show the character interacting with others. Letting your readers see how the character interacts with her mother, or an old friend she ran into on the streets, can provide insight into who he is and what he'll do next.
Describe your character's physical appearance. Your character's appearance can say a lot about him or her. Don't bore your reader with the ordinary details. Instead, show how your character looks to other people, or describe an aspect of the character's appearance that most people will overlook.
A typical short story is around 15-25 pages in length, so you don't have to worry about developing ten believable characters. Work on having an engaging protagonist, and a few other interesting characters, but know that not all of the minor characters have to have depth.

, Tell your reader what is at stake in your story from the very first line or paragraph. In a short story, you only have so much time to develop your ideas, so if you start with the dramatic tension of the story, you can work backwards to explain why it's so important. Here are some ways to do it:


Tell your readers a secret. Say, ""Mary had been sleeping with her sister's husband for the past three months."" As you tell your readers more about this situation and how Mary is being forced to deal with it, your readers will feel included in the drama and will be waiting to see how it unfurls.
Introduce a conflict. Say, ""Bobby hadn't seen his brother Sam in over twenty years. He wondered if he would have the nerve to show up to their father's funeral."" These two sentences already set up the central conflicts for the reader: that Bobby and his brother have stopped speaking for some reason, and that Bobby may have to confront him. As the story unfolds, the reader will want to know why the brothers stopped talking.
Hint at something significant from the character's past. Say, ""The second time Anna left her husband was just before her eightieth birthday."" Without giving the story away, you can show your readers that the story will describe why Anna was leaving her husband again, and why she did it the first time.

, Another way to start a story is to develop the setting. If the city or home where the story is set is significant, you can let your readers know about what it looks, smells, and sounds like before you develop the characters or plot. Here's how to do it:


Focus on sensory details. Tell your readers what a place looks, sounds, smells, and even feels like to the touch. Is it freezing in the story, or is it the hottest summer on record?
Anchor your readers. Without being too obvious, let them know where you are and when the story is taking place. Though you don't have to announce the year and location, provide enough information for your readers to figure it out.
Show how the setting relates to your characters. Pretend like you're a camera zooming in from bird's eye view to the home of a character. Start by looking at the whole town, neighborhood, and then show how your main character fits into this environment, or is a product of this environment.
Don't bore your readers. Though describing the setting in just the right amount of detail can grab your readers, if you're starting out as a writer, this may not be the way to go. Your readers may be impatient and will want to know who or what your story is about, not just where it's set.

, As you choose your opening, beware of falling into a trap by starting your opening in a way that is too predictable, confusing, cliched, or just overwhelming. Here's what not to do:


Avoid clichés. Don't start your story with a trite image or an overused line like, ""Sarah's heart was torn to shreds."" This will make your readers think that the rest of your story won't be very original either.
Avoid the ""information dump."" You don't have to tell your readers who the story is about, where your story is set, what conflict is at stake, and what your main character looks like all in the first two pages of the story. Think of writing as helping your readers climb a mountain. You want to give them enough information so they can move forward, but if you give them way too much information, then they'll be bogged down and will fall.
Avoid starting your story with a lot of questions or exclamation marks. Let the story speak for itself instead of trying too hard to convey excitement.
Don't confuse your readers with fancy language. Above all, make sure your readers know what the heck is going on in your story. You can sacrifice a few beautiful lines of imagery or too-clever dialogue to help your readers understand what's happening.

, Now that you've written your opening as well as a draft or two of your story, you should reflect on the story as a whole to see if the opening still fits. You should make sure that the opening hooks the reader, sets the tone for the rest of the piece, and puts the reader on the right track. Here's what you should do:


Read your story twice. First, read it to yourself without marking it, and then read it with a pen to mark any places where you want to cut passages or where you'll need to add information to bring the story together. Once you do this, you'll have a better sense of whether the opening is working or not.
See if you can start later in the story. The first few pages of a rough draft of a story can often just be the writer's way of clearing his throat before he can cut to the heart of the story. You may find that your opening provides too many unnecessary background details and that you're better off starting on page 2 — or even page 10.
Read your story aloud. When you read your work aloud, you may notice things that you wouldn't have caught while reading the words on the page. You'll be able to tell if your story flows naturally and if it has dialogue that is compelling and believable from the very beginning.

, Once you feel confident about the rough draft of your story, you should be ready to ask for feedback. Remember that asking for feedback too early in the writing process, before you even really have a sense of what you're writing about, can discourage you from pursuing your ideas. Having the right opinion can help you revise your opening, as well as the rest of your story. Tell your readers that you're focusing on the opening but would like an overall opinion as well. Here are some places to turn for feedback:


Ask a friend who loves reading short stories and is able to give constructive feedback.
Ask a friend who is a fellow writer.
Turn your story in to a writer's workshop and pay attention to the feedback that you get, especially about the opening. Remember that your opening won't be effective if the rest of the story doesn't come together.
Once you feel confident about your story and want to try to get it published, try sending it out to a number of literary journals. Even if your story is not accepted, you may receive valuable feedback from editors.

Understand what makes a book both rare and valuable.,
Determine the condition of the book.,
Consult a professional book dealer if you don’t feel confident when assessing the condition of a book.,
Research the rarity of the book.,
Research all the factors that may make your rare book more valuable:


First printing of a first edition.,
Enter your book information on a book selling website to get an idea of the book’s worth.",How to Research the Value of Rare Books," Look for standard identification points, which are details that most book publishers adhere to when printing first editions. These details, called issue points, include:


Codes on the copyright page
Binding type
Dust jacket particularities;
, This is especially important if you are trying to decide if you should purchase a rare book. A book in poor condition, even if it is rare, could have little or no value. Collectors want books that are in new, very fine or pristine condition. If a book is heavily damaged or falling apart, the chances are slim that it will have any real value. Carefully examine the book you are considering purchasing or that you already own, and look for:


Foxing—are any of the pages yellowed, stained, torn, warped or spotted? Are there written notations in the margins? Have sentences been underlined?
Boards—are the front and back boards of the binding firmly attached or are they loose or unhinged?
Plates—are there any plates (pictures) missing or damaged?
Pages—are there any missing pages anywhere in the book? This includes the copyright page and any introduction, forward, dedication or epilogue pages.
Binding—Does the book have its original binding or has it been repaired? Does the book have its original dust jacket?

, You may think your book is in pretty good condition, but a collector can spot imperfections you may not see.

, Determining how many copies of a book actually exist is not an exact science, but you can get a good idea by searching online databases that list the number of copies that reside in libraries and other institutions. It’s impossible to know how many more copies exist in private collections, but an online database will give you a rough idea of how many known copies are around. A rare book in good condition and limited known copies is highly marketable.

,
Limited edition numbered copies.
First printing of first editions that contain a misprint. For example, Cold Mountain, published in 1997, had a typographical error on page 25 in the first printing. This issue point is important because it tells collectors that the copy was among the first printing of a first edition—the error was corrected in subsequent editions. First printing copies of the book without the error have a lesser value.
Limited editions with leather bindings.

, You can enter the title, author and publisher to begin your search. When a list of matches comes up, carefully compare the attributes of your book to the attributes of the listed books. Look for as many detail matches as possible; the binding, edition, dust jacket, etc.

Begin with the alphabet.,
Distinguish vowels from consonants.,
Use phonics.,
Recognize punctuation marks.",How to Teach Yourself to Read1," The alphabet is where it all begins. The 26 letters that make up the English alphabet are used to form all of the words in the English language, so this is the place to start. There are several ways to get familiar with the alphabet; pick the one that suits you and your learning style.



Sing it. It may seem silly, but there's a reason so many people have learned the alphabet by singing the “alphabet song”--it works. The melody aids in memorization and the song as a whole gives learners a picture of the entire alphabet and the relationship between letters.

You can listen to the alphabet song online or get someone you know to sing and record it for you so that you can listen to it over and over again as you learn it.



Feel it. If you're a hands-on learner, consider buying sandpaper letters. Look at a letter and then close your eyes, trace your fingers over the letter and repeat the name of the letter and its sound. When you're ready, pick your finger up off the sandpaper and write the letter in the air.

Move it around. Pick up a set of alphabet magnets as a way of learning the individual letters as well as the way they're sequenced in the alphabet. Later, you can reuse these letters to practice forming words.

Walk it out. If you have the room, try using an alphabet mat as a learning tool. Say each letter and its sound as you step on that letter on your mat. Have someone call out letters or sounds at random and step on the correct corresponding letter. Get your whole body (voice included) involved by singing the alphabet song and making up a dance as you step your way through the alphabet.;
, There are five vowels in the alphabet: a, e, i, o, u; the rest of the letters are called consonants.


You make vowel sounds in your throat with the help of your tongue and mouth while you form consonants by using your tongue and mouth to control the flow of your breath. Vowels can be spoken alone, but consonants can't. For example, the letter A is simply ""a"" but B is actually ""bee,"" C is ""see,"" D is ""dee"" and so on.

, Phonics is all about relationships, specifically the relationships between letters and sounds in a language. For example, when you learn that the letter C sounds like ""sa"" or ""ka"" or that “tion” sounds like ""shun"", you're learning phonics.


Find an approach that makes sense to you. Phonics is typically taught in one of two ways: by what's called a see-and-say approach in which you learn to read whole words or a syllable approach in which you learn how to sound out different letter combinations and put them together to form words.
To learn phonics, you must hear the sounds of the syllables and/or words. To do that, you need to find an online program, purchase or borrow a DVD from your local library or work with a family member, friend, tutor or instructor who can help you learn the sounds created by various letter combinations and what those look like written out.

, It's important to know what common punctuation marks indicate when you're reading because they can offer information about sentence meanings.



Comma (,). When you see a comma, you're meant to pause or slightly hesitate when you're reading.

Period (.). A period indicates the end of a sentence. When you reach a period, come to a complete stop and take a deep breath before continuing to read.

Question mark (?). When you ask a question, your voice goes up. When you see ? at the end of sentence, a question is being asked, so make sure your voice rises when you're reading.

Exclamation point (!). This mark is used to emphasize an important point or to grab attention. When you read a sentence that ends with !, be sure to sound excited or to strongly emphasize the words.

Choose meaningful reading material.,
Read aloud.,
Make time to read.",How to Teach Yourself to Read2," Since the best readers read with a purpose, it makes sense for you to begin with materials you want to or need to read in your everyday life. These can include things such as short and simple newspapers and magazine articles, work memos, schedules and medical instructions.

, The best way to get familiar with the words on the page is to say them out loud. Working with a teaching partner, ""sound out"" unfamiliar words and use the pictures, verbal explanations and context to figure our the meaning of the new words.

, Reading often and for sustained, uninterrupted periods of time will help you develop vocabulary and become a more proficient reader. Set aside specific amounts of time each day to devote to reading. Keep track of what you read and for how long by creating a reading log.

Look for picture clues. Check out the photos, illustrations or other visuals on the page. Explore what's in them (people, places, objects, actions) that might make sense in the sentence.

Sound out the word. Starting with the first letter, say each letter-sound out loud slowly. Then repeat the sounds, blending them together to form the word and considering if the word makes sense in the sentence.

Chunk it up. Look at the word and see if you can pick out any sound/symbols, prefixes, suffixes, endings or base words that you already know. Read each ""chunk"" by itself and then try blending the chunks together and sound out the word.

For example, if you know that ""pre"" means ""before"" and ""view"" means ""to look at,"" you could figure out that ""preview"" means ""to look at ahead of time"" if you approached the word by breaking it up into those two chunks.



Look for connections. Consider whether the unfamiliar word bears any resemblance to a word you might already know. Ask yourself if it's a chunk or a form of the unfamiliar word.

You could also try using the known word in the sentence to see if it makes sense; it could be that the meanings of the two words are close enough for understanding.



, Go back over the sentence again. Try substituting different words for the word you don't know and see if any of your ideas make sense.

, Rather than getting stuck on a word you don't know, read past it and look for more clues. If the word is used again in the text, compare that sentence to the first and brainstorm as to what word might make sense in both.

, Take into account what you know about the topic of the book, paragraph or sentence. Based on your knowledge of the subject matter, is there a word that might make sense in the sentence?

, Look at the pictures, table of contents, chapter headings, maps, diagrams and other features of your book. Then, based on what you saw, write down what you think the book will be about, what kinds of information might be included. As you read, keep updating your predictions based on what comes up in the text.

, After reviewing the title, chapter headings, images and other information in the book, write down some questions you might have or things you're now curious about. Try to answer these questions as you read and write down the answers you find. If you're left with questions, think about whether you could find those answers from some other source.

, Think of the story you're reading as though it were a movie. Get a good mental image of the characters and the setting and try to see the story unfolding in time and space. Identify and describe what's happening by making sketches, diagrams or cartoon-style grids.

, Ask yourself if there's anything about the story you can relate to. Do any of the characters remind you of someone you know? Have you had similar experiences? Have you learned some of the concepts discussed in the book at school, home or through your own life experiences? Does the style of the story resemble a style you've read before or a movie or television show you've seen? Write down any similarities you come up with and use them to help with your understanding of the text.

, One helpful way to ensure that something you've read makes sense to you is to talk through it with someone else. Once you've finished a paragraph, article, short story or chapter, sum up in your own words what it was about. Hearing yourself say it out loud and discovering if the person on the receiving end has questions you can or can't answer can point out any gaps in your understanding and what you might need to reread for greater clarity.

Get tested for learning disabilities.",How to Teach Yourself to Read4," The Literacy Information and Communication Service is an online resource sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education. By accessing their website, you can see a list of literacy programs in your specific geographic area. Many of the programs listed are free, but you need to read the details of each listing to be sure.

, Many libraries offer free literacy programs that pair learners or small groups of learners with a trained literacy tutor. These programs are free of charge and are typically offered on an on-going basis so you don't have to wait for a certain start date to begin instruction.

, Check with your local YMCA, church, public school or other community group to see if they sponsor a literacy program or if they can pair you with someone who'd be willing to help you improve your reading skills.

, It could be that you've had difficulties learning to read because you suffer from a learning disability. For example, dyslexia, a learning disability characterized by difficulty in interpreting spatial relationships or integrating auditory and visual information, is the most common learning disability and affects about 10 percent of the population.Having a learning disability does not mean you won't be able to learn how to read, it just means you may have to use special tools or customize the process by which you learn.

, Example: Marie is elderly and intelligent, the corner store is old but well-kept and familiar to Marie, she got there by car.

, Example: Marie, an elderly woman, went to her car. She locked the door behind her. She drove to the corner store. When she got there she bought some milk and bread and tea and a newspaper and then she went home.

, In the previous example, the reader is told that Marie is elderly and exactly what steps she took to carry out her errand. Did you find it engaging?

, Example: Marie put on her glasses, picked up her purse from the table by the garage door and shuffled through the door to her 1998 Dodge Neon. The hum of the garage door mingled with the struggling engine. ""Come on, old girl, we ain't dead yet,"" Marie whispered to the dashboard. She carefully backed out of the driveway and into the street, automatically pressing the button to tell the garage to close. Two minutes later, she pulled in at a building whose wooden sign, its fresh paint bright against the weathered walls, proclaimed ""Benny's Corner Store"". Marie smoothed her silver ponytail, reapplied her lipstick, and, allowing her joints plenty of time to stretch, maneuvered out one door and in another.

, But isn't it more fun to imagine the second version?

Become a member of a professional chaplain organization.",How to Become a Chaplain," A chaplain is ordained or hired by an organization or faith group to minister to people's needs in a variety of different settings. Chaplains commonly work at hospitals, nursing homes, military bases and in prisons. As a chaplain, your role is to connect with people in need of guidance and provide counsel and solace to those who are ill, confined to the home, or deployed away from their hometown. Depending on where you are employed, your duties could include:


Visiting people affiliated with your church or synagogue or organization at home or in the hospital, or holding office hours during which people can come to you.
Listening to and praying with people in need of spiritual support.
Leading religious services or prayer sessions.
Providing grief counseling.
Conducting funeral services.;
, A chaplain must be capable of deep empathy and open to forming relationships with a variety of different people from all backgrounds.As a chaplain, you will be in a position to help people who are at their most vulnerable, whether they're terminally ill or stationed in a place far away from their home and family. Having the ability to connect with people from any type of background is the most important prerequisite for being a chaplain.


Chaplains working in hospitals and prisons and at military bases interact with people who have a variety of different religious backgrounds. Some people seeking spiritual guidance may not be religious at all. To be an effective chaplain, it's important to be open to and accepting of all types of religious beliefs, even those different from your own.
Even if you're affiliated with a particular religious congregation, you'll need to be able to work with people who come from many different walks of life. You may be called to counsel someone who has made choices that go against the tenets of your religion, for example. An ability to put your personal opinions aside for the sake of being as helpful and empathetic as possible is important no matter who you're working with.

, No matter where you work as a chaplain, you will encounter new individuals on a regular basis. There is a chance that you may only meet someone once or twice, and so you must be able to help, inspire, and motivate people with whom you've only just become acquainted. The goal is always to forge deep, meaningful bonds that will sustain people through the very toughest circumstances.It takes a special person to be able to form this type of relationship quickly.

, One of your main duties as a chaplain will be counseling those under spiritual distress. When people come to you for help, they will share sensitive details with you with the expectation that you keep that information between the two of you. Just as a counselor or psychiatrist is expected to remain confidential, you will be expected to do the same. A chaplain who cannot be trusted will soon lose his potency and effectiveness.

, People experience spiritual crises all throughout the day, even in the middle of the night. Depending on where you work, like a doctor on call, you may need to drop what you're doing or wake up at odd hours to help someone who is troubled. Being selfless in this way does not come easy to most people; it can be exhausting and take a personal toll. It's this particular generosity of spirit that makes chaplains special.


However, it will be important to erect some boundaries to protect your own personal life. You may or may not choose to give out your personal contact information, for example. Depending on where you are employed, there may be other restrictions in place.

, When you have to offer guidance to people all day long, you may start to feel your energy drain away. As a chaplain, you must be able to help yourself and keep yourself from deteriorating spiritually. Being firm in your own spirituality and being able to handle the stress of helping others is integral to becoming a chaplain who can make a difference.

, Many institutions and organizations will not view you as a suitable potential chaplain until you have earned at least a Bachelor's Degree.When seeking to become a chaplain, the most helpful and relevant educational focuses will be theology and counseling.


Some colleges, universities and seminaries may offer specialized chaplain training with the goal of producing chaplains. However, getting an undergraduate degree in religion or a related field is also sufficient.
If you aspire to become a chaplain in a particular institution, like a hospital or prison, supplement your undergraduate education with volunteer experience. This will be looked upon favorably when it comes to applying for jobs.

, Many institutions require that chaplains have at least a master's level education (and some prefer candidates with PhDs). This is especially necessary if you seek to become a hospital or military chaplain. Pursue your master's in divinity or a related field, and consider advancing to a doctoral program if the job you desire requires it.


Such degrees are available at seminaries and accredited universities.
A focus on biblical counseling or pastoral care will give you the right tools to become a chaplain.

, Hospital chaplains are often required to receive this training, which provides experience in the field as a supplement to educational coursework.You will have the opportunity to work with people in need in a healthcare facility or prison. CPE brings together chaplains of all different faiths and provides them with real-world, invaluable experience that will be applied on the job later on. It's a requirement for many certification programs.


Look into CPE centers at the type of facility where you want to work, so you'll gain experience working with that particular population.
The CPE program is divided into units. One unit typically takes about 3 months to complete. Some certification programs require that you complete up to 4 units.

, Because the chaplain occupation is rooted in religion, training in religious education and practice is a necessity. In some cases you may be required to be ordained and endorsed by your religious organization before you're hired as a chaplain. For example, the US Army requires that you be a clergy person in your denomination or faith group in order to apply.Many religious groups and organizations have their own standards and qualifications that you must meet before you can be officially endorsed as an eligible chaplain. Determine what steps you need to take to become a clergy person in your congregation.


In many cases, a graduate-level degree from a seminary will be required in order to become a clergy person.
In addition to ordination, your faith group must give you an endorsement, stating that you have the ecclesiastical qualifications to adequately represent your faith group and be a competent chaplain., Depending on where you want to work, you may be required to obtain certification from an organization recognized by the Association of Professional Chaplains. There are many national chaplain organizations that each have slightly different standards for certifying chaplains. Choose the one that best matches your beliefs and work ambitions. In general, you'll need to pass a written test meet the following requirements to receive certification:


Ordination as a minister (or the equivalent in your faith group)
Endorsement from your faith group
A graduate degree in theology (or a related subject)
Four units of CPE completed

, Some hospitals and other facilities require that chaplains complete a residency before permanently coming on board as a chaplain. Residencies are completed under the supervision of a senior chaplain and may last one to two years.Once the residency has been completed to the organization's satisfaction, the candidate can become a chaplain.


Resident chaplains work with families and hospital staff and attend lectures and seminars as part of their training.

, In the United States, the largest group for professional chaplains is the Association for Professional Chaplains, which accepts members from many different religious backgrounds. There exist a number of other chaplaincy organizations, and they all have their own requirements for membership. Becoming a member of one of these organizations is a great way to network with other chaplains and gain access to job opportunities as they arise.

Establish the premise.,
Emphasize the conflict in the novel.,
Show character development.,
Outline the plot.,
Be clear about the book’s ending.,
Review your synopsis.,
Make sure your synopsis answers the important questions.,
Keep practicing.",How to Write a Book Synopsis1," Although the synopsis is a very brief snapshot of a much larger work, you still need to take the time to establish the overall premise of the novel and include any essential information the reader would need to understand the story.Imagine someone is reading the synopsis before the book. What information is critical to include? Are there specific details about the setting of the novel or the world you’ve created that a reader would need to understand?
Remember, you are trying to draw the reader into the story, so include a few interesting details that help people visualize where and when this is occurring.;
, It can be overwhelming trying to decide what to include in a synopsis, but a good rule of thumb is to identify and outline the main conflict in the story.What struggles does the protagonist or main character confront in the book?
Are there specific obstacles the characters encounter that you should mention in the synopsis?
What will happen if the protagonist fails or stumbles?

, While it can be frustrating to try and condense a novel’s worth of awesome character development into a synopsis, many literary agents report that they want synopses to demonstrate how the main character changes over the course of the novel.Try to keep the main characters from appearing one-dimensional by showing how they react to different situations. Even though you don’t have a lot of space in the synopsis, you can still provide readers with a sense of who the characters are and how they change over the course of the story.

, Because the synopsis is designed to be a summary of the book, you will need to outline the plot of your novel and give a sense of the novel’s narrative direction.It can be hard not to get bogged down in details, but a good place to start is by including a brief summary (1 to 2 sentences) of each chapter. Then, try to link and connect these summaries together.You won’t be able to include all plot details, so try to identify the ones that are critical to understanding the book. Ask yourself if the ending would still make sense without that detail. If so, then leave it out of the synopsis., You might be reluctant to spoil the ending, but a synopsis should be clear about the novel’s ending and ultimate resolution.Literary agents want to know how you resolve the conflict in the novel and tie up your story.
Don't worry. If your story is published, the synopsis won’t be included on the back of the book and spoil the story for readers.

, It’s important for you to review the synopsis, and also ask other people to review the synopsis. The more feedback you seek from others, the clearer you can make your synopsis.


It can be helpful to read your synopsis out loud because you will be better able to notice grammar mistakes and find opportunities to improve the wording. Your brain has to process the information in a different way when you read aloud, and you often notice mistakes and problems you previously overlooked.Ask friends, family members, or colleagues who have not read the book yet or aren’t familiar with what you are working on to read the synopsis. They will be able to provide a more objective view, and let you know if the synopsis makes sense to them and draws them into the story.

, Before you submit your synopsis, make sure it provides an answer to the following critical questions:Who is the central character in the book?
What are they looking for, searching for, or trying to achieve?
Who or what makes their search, quest, or journey difficult?
What ends up happening?

, Many writers report that synopses are among the most difficult pieces to write because they are trying to distill an entire book’s worth of material into a few paragraphs. Fortunately, however, the more often you practice writing synopses, the better you will be at this exercise.To get practice writing synopses, try working on one for a classic book or try writing a synopsis of a book you just read. Sometimes it is easier to start out practicing on a book that you haven’t spent hours, days, or years preparing.

Ask for feedback.",How to Write a Book Synopsis2," If you are working with an agent or a specific publisher, make sure you ask them about or familiarize yourself with their specific guidelines for the synopsis. You want to make sure you format it and submit it the way they want so it gets the best reception possible.If you are unsure, ask the agent or publisher about length, formatting, and style.
Even if this is an assignment for a class, make sure you adhere to the instructions or guidelines your teacher provided.

, Just like a synopsis for a work of fiction, you need to offer a brief summary of the content.Focus on clearly articulating your argument, and explain why the book should be published. Make an argument for why your book is important in some way.

, Even if you have not finished the book, you should still be able to provide a clear outline of its structure in the synopsis. Provide a chapter breakdown with temporary titles for each chapter, which will give an agent or publisher a good idea of the direction the work is headed.You can also include a short description (1 to 2 sentences) of each chapter.

, In the synopsis, explain what sets your book apart from existing material on the subject. Discuss how you bring something different to the table.For example, does your book offer a unique perspective or a new way of thinking about a topic?
List the leading authors and publications in the field and be clear about how your project is original.
Also, describe why you are the author best suited or qualified to produce this work.

, A publisher will look at your book and try to determine its place in the market and the intended audience. Take space in the synopsis to discuss where you see the book fitting in to the existing market.Include information on the section of the bookstore or bookshop you see your book being stocked in. This helps publishers assess whether the book will have an audience and how it should be marketed.
Are there groups you think would have a definite interest in this book? For example, would this be used in specific college courses, or are there events such as historical anniversaries that the book could be linked to and marketed around?, Many nonfiction books are accepted while still being written, but you should provide a clear time table of your anticipated progress in the synopsis.Discuss how much is currently completed, and give an estimate of when you expect to have a manuscript prepared.

, Include other pertinent details in the synopsis, such as an estimated word count and information about whether you will need illustrations. The more information you include about the structure and format of the book, the easier it will be for a publisher to determine if they would like to take the project on., To strengthen your synopsis, share the interesting and unique credentials that helped you write the book.While education and training are important things to mention, also think about whether there are parts of your background or life that publishers and readers may find interesting.

, Like any writing activity, sharing a draft of your synopsis with others can help you improve your wording and make the synopsis clearer and more compelling. Ask friends, family, and colleagues for feedback on a draft.


You do not have to be a specialist in the field to determine if a synopsis is interesting and readable, so don’t worry about finding someone who is an expert on the subject matter you write about.

"
"
Don’t write the synopsis from the perspective of your main character.,
Pare down your wording.,
Avoid revealing too many character details or introducing secondary characters.,
Stop analyzing or interpreting the book’s themes.,
Don’t leave unanswered or rhetorical questions in the synopsis.,
Avoid writing a synopsis that is simply a basic plot summary.",How to Write a Book Synopsis3," The synopsis should be written from a third-person perspective rather than from the point of view of your main characters. Synopses are also usually written in present rather than past tense.For example, instead of writing “I went to the beach house every summer,” write, “Susan travels to the beach every summer.”

, Synopses are meant to be brief, and wordiness is a common mistake in synopses. Although it can feel painful to cut out dialogue and trim down wording, it will help you create a more sleek and readable synopsis.Ask yourself if all the details are really relevant to the synopsis or if they can be left out. If your reader can still get a good idea of what the book is about without those details, scrap them.
Dialogue is usually unnecessary in the synopsis, but if you do include it, keep it to a minimum and make sure it is used to reveal an important turning point or character development.
Don’t worry about making your prose lyrical or elaborate. It will take up too much space, and you should focus your energy on using precise wording and providing a clear summary of your book. When you re-read your synopsis, ask yourself if there is a clearer or more precise word you could use in place of the one you currently included.

, You’ve probably spent a lot of time developing your characters and their backstories, but the synopsis is not the place to explore all of these details or introduce every character in your book.Include just enough detail to make the characters interesting and establish how they are connected or related. In the synopsis, a few phrases are typically sufficient to explain who a character is and where they come from.

, The synopsis is intended to be a summary or brief overview of the book, so do not feel pressured to engage in literary analysis or interpretation of the book’s themes or hidden meanings. The synopsis is not the place for this kind of examination.

, Although you might feel tempted to build suspense and leave certain questions unanswered or ask rhetorical questions, these will distract the reader from your synopsis.For example, don’t write, “Will Tyler ever identify his mother’s killer?” Instead of posing this question, your synopsis should provide an answer.

, You want your synopsis to draw readers in and make them want to read the entire work. Offering a basic play-by-play of the story will make the reader feel like they are reviewing a dry, technical manual.Instead try to inject more emotion and detail into the synopsis by giving insight into how the characters feel.
If you find yourself writing things such as “this happened, then this happened, and finally, this occurred,” it’s time to take a break and revisit the synopsis when you are feeling fresh. You don’t want the synopsis to feel like a boring rundown of a sports game.
Some writers suggest pretending you are describing the book to your friends in the same way you would describe an exciting movie. Omit the boring or trivial details and focus on the highlights."
"
Double space the synopsis.,
Be sure to include your book’s title and your name.,
Use a standard font.,
Indent paragraphs.,
Pay attention to length guidelines.",How to Write a Book Synopsis4," If the synopsis is longer than one page in length, double space the document. It will be easier for the literary agent to read., When you are rushing to finish your synopsis, it can be easy to forget including the title of your book and your name. Make sure these details are on each page of the document in the upper left-hand corner.If a literary agent likes your synopsis, you want to make sure they know who to contact.

, While you might feel like you should use a more interesting font, it's best to stick with a standard one such as Times New Roman that is easy to read and will open on a variety of devices.If you typed your book in a certain font, stick with the same font for the synopsis so they match. You might also be submitting sample chapters, and the documents will look like they are part of the same package or go together.

, Although the synopsis is a shorter document, you do not want it to appear like you wrote it in a stream of consciousness. To prevent this from happening, indent paragraphs so your synopsis looks neat and well-organized., Length requirements of synopses vary depending on the literary agent or publishing company. Make sure you follow the guidelines you are given or ask the agent or publisher you are working with what they would prefer.


Some writers recommend starting with a 5 page synopsis, and then condensing this document and trimming it down as needed.Be prepared for different length requirements ahead of time by having a 1 page and 3 page synopsis on hand. Even if the length requirements are slightly different, you should be able to easily adapt a 1 page or 3 page version."

",How to Be Inspired by Hilary Duff," Hilary started out as an actress first. If your school is putting on a production, play or musical, take part in it! Even if it includes singing, because you never know, one day you might be discovered. Hilary started out in a Disney Channel show ""Lizzie McGuire"", for younger audiences. Remember to start out slow, and be patient! Don't rush into anything.;
, In this way, you can relate to her characters and you can see the way she acts in a depressing role, or maybe in a happy and bubbly role, or maybe even a down-to-earth typical girl like you role. Watch everything: her expressions, her moods, and the way she acts, so that you can be inspired to do some similar acting, if you ever break into showbiz.

, She's a Texas girl, and even if you're not from Texas, it's okay! Because Hilary's got a lot of things in common with you. For example, she has two ex-boyfriends, she has an older sister Haylie, she loves spending time with her family and she keeps a puppy as a pet! A lot of these things may be similar in your life, so don't think she's from another planet. She's a normal girl, just like you!

, No, you don't have to be a perfectionist when it comes to acting and singing, but you might as well try stretching out your vocal cords. You can go on Google to look for tips on how to sing well, or how to practice singing. You could join the Choir in your school, or maybe even just practice singing by yourself in your bedroom or even in the shower. You'll eventually get a nice voice, and you could take part in musicals or offer singing for charity, or something similar.

, Change your greediness and selfishness and replace it with love and care. And if you can't do that, turn into an optimist. Look at the bright side of things. If you think somebody's got a better life than you and is more appreciated, be thankful you're not alone. Don't look down on yourself!

, Hilary supports a stack of charities, and is constantly visiting orphanages, hospitals and homeless people. I bet you didn't know that Hilary and her older sister Haylie Duff invited a few sick orphans to the set of their movie 'Material Girls'. Help people's wishes come true. If a friend needs help, help her! You don't have to say no or tell her to go away just to be cool in front of your friends. Well, that's not cool at all. What is cool is to help somebody when they need it. Someday you'll be rewarded for that.

, When Hilary Duff changed her sweet girl look to a more sophisticated look, in 2008, there is no need to be critical. A lot of people reported that it didn't look nice, and she should remain the sweet daddy's girl always. However, it's HER decision to change her appearance. After all, everybody grows up eventually and changes their looks, personality and appearance, so why not Hilary? Besides, she's twenty three years old and she needs her space. You can introduce changes as well, but if you're younger it's probably better not to do things like dye your hair or wear black leather jackets.

, It will take time just to become a successful business woman, let alone create two perfumes and your own fashion line. However, anything is possible if you just believe in it. Hilary is a spokeswoman and a businesswoman, and allowing yourself to be inspired by that, you could always take subjects in school, such as Economics, Business Studies, Travel and Tourism, etc. Being smart and working hard now can help you achieve your goals in the future, believe it or not!

, Hilary is a modest person and an overall sweet girl. If there were any bad rumours flying around about her, Hilary would snap them off by declaring them untrue. She also surrounds herself with wise people and is a very strong person herself!

Just watch or listen to something different,and see if you like it. If you are looking for someone else, this may be the way to go about it.;
, Look up facts on them, visit a fan club site, look at pictures of them. Get to know their history - their career - anything that hints at who they are and what they've done.

, You could do such things such as listening to their music or watching one of their films. Or, if you prefer to be really creative, how about making a fan book about them? Get a good quality notebook, write about them, stick in images or notes, whatever to make your book special.

, Put them up on your bedroom wall so you can look at them whenever you like. Or, if you reckon you're a good at drawing, you could have a go at drawing a picture of them! Do so carefully. Put it up in your room, and when people see they can know how much you love the celebrity!

, Don't worry if they have never heard of him or don't like him/her that much, just because she/he is not the most popular celeb on the street, that you like him is the only thing that matters!

, Write to their fan mail address and write a bit about yourself and why you like their work so much. However, be careful not to be tempted to scribble 'I love you! You're so hot! Will you marry me?' all over the page as it may seem a bit over the top to them. A celebrity's favorite fan is a respectful one, who won't fill the page with such content. Remember to say thank-you for reading the letter! Who knows? - You might get a reply!

, Lots of celebrities are into writing autobiographies etc., and a great way to show your appreciation of the celebrity is to read their literature. If you're feeling brave, write a review!

, There's nothing wrong with being a great fan, but it's important to keep a grip on your own life. You're unlikely to have a conversation with them, so it may be wise to be a fan, but not to dream too much about the celebrity. That's not to say you should give up!

, Take notes on things you like about them, like helping charity, as you could do this too. You could make them your role model, if you're really fanatic, and get into activities they like!

, Associate mostly with people you can benefit from. Small talk is senseless; only talk to people in order to get to your destination. If you are at a bar sitting alone, ignore people who try talking to you. Gain knowledge by using your own sources. Read from books and internet sources to learn.

, Don't give out information about yourself without knowing who you're talking to. Is this person really trustworthy?

, Even though you talk to barely anyone make sure you talk to the right people. Research a bit about the person you want to network with, why they would be useful for you to have in your network, and always have them on the back burner in case you ever need them. You never know when you'll need a famous boxer to help you or your loved ones out of a situation.

, Or ""Powerbook."" A good quality laptop is essential since much of your knowledge and access to everything revolves around that. Learn how to navigate the Internet and use it to your benefit.

, You want to look competent in what you're doing. If it's a school project, it needs to be perfect. If it's your dissertation, it needs to be flawless with no points missing. Learn how to write in MLA or APA format, whichever your school/class requires, and know how to cite your sources perfectly. Use books and internet to help you do this.

, You never hear of Lisbeth watching tv or going to the movies or doing something that is ""wasting time"". Instead read to improve your knowledge and to research.

, Find articles and methods that teach you how to improve your memory. Lisbeth had photographic memory. Even if you are nowhere near that, you can practice and try to improve your own memory.

, As soon as the assignment is given, your brain should be already churning. What to do? Where to go? Who to see? Do not procrastinate. Get to work and don't sleep until you're finished.

, Don't let anyone say you're not good enough. Don't take no for an answer. Be persistent. If someone puts you down, stand up for yourself.

, Try to know a little bit about everything. Read the paper/current news. Know a little bit about astronomy, math, chemistry, biology, etc. Take a self-defense class. Learn to box. Do things that would make you not rely on other people for help.

Laugh.",How to Read Ulysses," Before learning how to read Ulysses, you have to know what you're getting into. Ulysses comprises 18 ""Episodes"". Each of these episodes was serialized separately, and each one reads completely differently. For example, Episode 14 parodies all of the great authors of the English language, going from Chaucer to Dickens, and Episode 18 is a lengthy monologue of about 10,000 words that comprises two giant run-on sentences. Every Episode reads like a completely different book, and therein lies the beauty of Ulysses.;
, When doing a formal, academic study of Ulysses, you should buy some form of guidebook. These books are about four hundred pages thick and explain Ulysses line by line. This is good because Ulysses is full of esoteric puns and references, and the guidebooks explain it all. However, switching from guidebook to guidebook over and over is very annoying. The best way to read Ulysses, if you're trying to read it for fun, is to just dive right in, saving all of those guidebooks for a college course.

, No, really, this 700 page text is hilarious. The entire idea of the novel is that Joyce is taking the epic heroes of The Odyssey and turning them into these pathetic Dubliners. The end of Episode 4 features a ten page poop joke written in the same elevated language as The Odyssey. Understanding that every sentence has some form of joke in it, be it some esoteric reference to literature or a subtle pun, turns Ulysses into a very intelligent comedy.

, But that's mostly because Joyce designed it that way. Part of the joke is that you're not going to get everything, and there's humor in that. Laugh whenever you don't get something, because you've just walked into one of the most brilliant practical jokes in literature.

, Because each chapter is written differently, it takes a few pages to get into the rhythm of each episode.

, Since each episode has a different style, knowing what to appreciate beforehand can help. As such, here is a list of all of the episodes and their brand of comedy.


Episode 1: Normal novel.
Episode 2: An informal catechism.
Episode 3: Elitist masculine monologue.
Episode 4: Poking fun at the great heroes of yore.
Episode 5: The hypnotic nature of religion.
Episode 6: Death.
Episode 7: Making fun of journalism (it's written like a newspaper; pay attention to the headlines).
Episode 8: Food puns, everything can be eaten and everything eats in this chapter.
Episode 9: Making fun of Hamlet and elitists who debate over obscure pieces of literature (very much so making fun of certain scholars who would later analyze Ulysses).
Episode 10: This chapter has nothing to do with the main characters. It is instead presented as a bunch of short stories surrounding the side characters. The humor comes in the fact that it is largely pointless and that most of the side characters make fun of the main characters.
Episode 11: Everything is a music pun. A lot of onomatopoeia is used.
Episode 12: There are two narrators: one who is hyper-colloquial to the point of not making sense, and one who is hyper-scientific to the point of not making sense. The competition between the narrators produces the comedy.
Episode 13: Narrated by a young girl, and everything is a sex joke.
Episode 14: An elaborate parody of all the great English authors.
Episode 15: Written as a hallucinatory play in the red light district.
Episode 16: This chapter is super ambiguous, and the comedy comes from mistaking characters for other characters.
Episode 17: Written as a catechism, the comedy comes from the hyper-scientific question and answer format being applied to the mundane.
Episode 18: Streaming consciousness of Bloom's wife.

, Joyce wrote two graphic organizers. They are called the schemas. Use them to introduce yourself to the chapter. They can be found here:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linati_schema_for_Ulysses and here:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_schema_for_Ulysses

, In an Irish accent, preferably. A lot of the puns make more sense when heard.

, Reading this novel is difficult, so you have to set up a schedule for yourself or you'll give up.

, A lot of Ulysses makes fun of Dubliners and A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, so reading them beforehand allows you to practice reading Joyce's style and give you background knowledge for some of Joyce's jokes.

, When you get a joke, write it down in the margins. It'll help you comprehend other similar jokes.

, This is a work of comic fiction. Laugh aloud. Laugh at everything. It's funny.

Understand what is happening to your sense of propriety.,
Allow time to heal.,
Be cautious about the media reporting of the situation or issue causing your idol to fall in your esteem.,
Aim to be understanding.,
Be compassionate.,
Analyze your expectations that cause you to idolize people in positions of power and fame.,
Appreciate the good in your fallen idol.",How to Deal With a Fallen Idol," When someone in a position of power or fame does something untoward, something unlike ""their usual self"", or breaches conventions unexpectedly, it tends to offend many people's sense of propriety or what they thought was ""right"" about this person. Sometimes the manufactured nature of the front this person put toward society becomes all too clear when they do something that brings about their demise. It may well be that the feeling of being offended comes about because you feel that the person in question is a hypocrite, is not authentic, and is a false representation of the characteristics that they were publicly held out as having. In turn, realize that your expectations of this person being a paragon of virtue may have been very unrealistic.;
, Many of the steps in this article will ask you to try to set aside your initial reaction in order to try to see things from your fallen idol's perspective and to try to distance yourself from media hype. All the same, it is important to mourn the loss of your belief in this person or what you believe they stood for, and to give yourself space to heal over what can very much feel like a sense of betrayal. Bear in mind that healing doesn't involve condoning or forgetting this person's actions or attitudes; the aim is to minimize the impact of your loss of faith in this person and to try to redeem what remains good out of the disappointment.

, You weren't at the event or in the situation, and you don't know the person for real, and neither do most of those reporting the incident or situation in question. It is easy to suppose or guess at what a person may or may not have done, or have felt compelled by, but it is far harder to confirm the facts and motivations. In general, what the public learns is usually only the partial truth and judging a person based on pulp media musings is liable to be riddled with misunderstandings.


Consider the situation of people who release auto-biographies years after they had something happen to them that besmirched their very public reputation. In such reveal-alls, you will often learn the person's own view of what motivated them and why they felt they were justified or repentant, etc. You will also learn from these that the media's role was less than angelic, was speculative, and was often wrong. Many an autobiography or biography, has changed a reader's perspective about a person. It may be years before you really get a grip on what the person in question did or what the situation really was about.

, Imagine what it must feel like to be under the spotlight 24/7. Despite the money, the fame, and the power, there is a large amount of responsibility to behave in a certain way all of the time that creates a lot of pressure. And that pressure can sometimes cause a person to feel tense, nervous, angry, and cooped up. The chattering adulation may come to mean little, and a person in the constant public spotlight may long for a time when people leave them alone. Alternatively, sometimes fame and power can lead people to believe that they are capable of anything and that the normal rules don't apply to them because their money or allure is a form of persuasion that works, opening doors that most people can only imagine. This heady fame and power trip isn't handled well by some who lose their sense of self, self-discipline, and boundaries. And unless you have been there, it is a little difficult to say you wouldn't fall that way...


Realize that the person might have been raised very differently from you, might see the world very differently from you, or could have been taught or encouraged to do the things they do. This aspect of your idol was probably always present but was not obvious until they fouled up.

, Try to stand in your fallen idol's shoes and imagine how they must feel when their indiscretions, stuff-ups, or sheer stupidity has exposed them so openly, and placed them at the mercy of the public's disgust, contempt, or hatred. It's surely not a good place to be and if it's something that can never be lived down, they will suffer an internal struggle for the rest of their lives, let alone being the poster child for whatever indiscretion or mistake they made.


Consider whether you really feel such abhorrence or disgust and whether it is right to feel that you are in a good position to judge a person harshly for the rest of their life? Ask yourself if you feel so morally superior to this person that you think it is all right to gossip and degrade them with any opportunity you get. Are you a gossiper and rumormonger normally?
Bear in mind that in joining the outraged mob, you leave little room for being imperfect in your own life. Compassion enables you to forgive the person for their error and to let them be, to find their own pathway to self-forgiveness. Compassion does not mean that you have to condone what they did; it simply means that you do not place yourself in a position of superiority to them, and that you recognize that you too could make similar mistakes if given similar circumstances, or at the very least, it is recognition that nobody's slate is clean.
Think of your past actions, and how unfair it would be for others to view you in your worst moments. Think how difficult it is nowadays when many situations can be preserved forever, such as text messages and videos.

, What do you get from admiring people to such a point that they seemingly can do no wrong in your eyes? Consider the possibility that this a rather unrealistic way to view some people in society, especially since you're hardly likely to do this with most people you know. Think about how you care for people generally; you know most of your family and friends have foibles but you love them or like them all the same, or you choose to overlook the foibles and get along with them at the very least.

, If you liked this person up to the moment of their ""demise"", there is no reason to cease appreciating the art, beauty, cleverness, changes, etc., that they have brought into the world. To deny your enjoyment of their music, sportsmanship, acting, scientific discoveries, writing, etc., would be akin to your boss telling you that all your work up to the point that he decided to call you on a bad report was for naught and was being erased. How wasteful and abrupt a response! All of us are made up of many facets, and none of us are saints. We spend much of life learning to build on our strengths, manage our weaknesses, and trying to lead a good life. And we all slip up occasionally. As complex beings, it would be unrealistic and unfruitful to deny every product of our labor and every creation from our thoughts when a bad characteristic errs out of proportion with our whole self.

Set yourself up somewhere comfortable.,
Read where there is sufficient lighting.,
Read somewhere quiet.,
Choose a suitable digital device for reading.,
Keep digital reading for evening and early nighttime only.,
If you enjoy reading in bed at night but this entails disturbing someone else, try some of these solutions:


Use a book light that clips onto the book.,
Ensure that you are getting enough sleep.,
Read something light.,
Change your reading habits.",How to Read at Night," Ensure that you have good support for your back and neck, especially after a hard day's work at the office or after staring at a screen all day. It's important to sit or lie in a way that won't cause you any neck or back pain or strain.


Ensure that you have good back and neck support if lying down or sitting on soft objects such as a couch. Add something helpful such as a horseshoe pillow or a large slanted pillow. Small neck pillows may be helpful too. If you're not sure what will help, talk to your physiotherapist for advice.;
, Do not strain your eyes reading at night; sit or lie near a source of good lighting, such as a lamp, an overhead light or a book reading light.


If you need reading glasses, wear them. They will reduce the strain that causes your eyes to feel tired.

, The brain is not made to multi-task, and if you try to watch TV and read at the same time, you'll find it is ineffective and frustrating. Give yourself the luxury of not reading and watching TV at the same time; TV is a distraction, reading requires your full concentration. Find a quiet place in the house if everyone else is reading.

, For some, this might mean an eReader, for others, a laptop or tablet. Whatever you choose, ensure that you can read with ease, that there is sufficient light and that the reading device is either supported or it's not too heavy to hold.


Some digital devices suitable for reading come with a stand or you are able to purchase one separately, to allow for hands-free reading.

, Avoid reading on a digital device prior to bedtime or late at night. This is because the bright screen can delay or suppress the release of melatonin, the hormone that regulates your circadian clock and helps you to feel sleepy.It is probably a good idea to always turn down the level of brightness of the reading screen and to stop reading on the device about two hours before your intended bedtime.

, This will keep the light source directly over the book and not on the other person.
Read under the covers with a flashlight. This is a good one for when it's cold; however, it does need a reasonably large bed so that you can stretch comfortably and make allowance for the flashlight's positioning.
Pop a camping/hiking lamp on your head.
Read before bed. Make yourself comfortable on the couch or elsewhere (even the guest room) to do your reading, then quietly tiptoe to bed when you start feeling sleepy.
Avoid reading on a digital device unless it's very dim and your sleeping partner shows no evidence of being disturbed by it.
Consider an audio book instead. That way, you can put earphones in, hide any light source and listen to your favorite book in the dark, until you're sleepy.
Get your partner to read to you. Collaboration is fantastic for long-term relationships!
Live with someone who can sleep through anything.

, Needing more sleep will bring on sleepiness when reading at night, accompanied by the effort put into reading.

, If you tend to feel sleepy when reading at night, stick to reading material that isn't asking much of you intellectually. If you don't have to try to grasp ""the theory of X"" but only have to read about ""the romance of Y"", you won't be thinking as hard, and it'll be less likely to cause drowsiness. If you are enjoying your reading, as opposed to having to read it because it's for work, class, etc., then it's likely you won't feel so drowsy either.


If you're studying or finalizing work, consider doing the tough reading earlier in the night. That way, you can leave lighter reading for bedtime.

, It might be that you associate reading with bed. If so, cease reading in bed and do not read lying down at nighttime. Sit or stand to read instead. Experiment with different positions, to see if any make you more sleepy and others help you to stay awake while reading.

Make yourself comfortable.,
Avoid distractions.,
Be awake and alert.",How to Read a Long Chapter Book in Two or Three Hours," First, look at the table of contents. Take note of how many chapters or sections there are and how many pages are in each. Flip through the book and take notes of charts, pictures, or subsections. Take a stab at what the book will cover ahead of time, this will assist with “active reading” later., For example, If there are fifteen chapters and you have three hours, you should divide 180 (60 minutes x 3) by fifteen. In this example, each chapter will take, on average, 12 minutes. Whatever the amount of time you calculate, this is not a hard and fast time, it is just a tool to help you keep track of your time and progress. You need to factor in times for breaks and also understand that some chapters will take longer amount of time and some will take a shorter amount of time to complete.

, Knowing your goals will help you pay attention to the right things and not waste time on irrelevant aspects of the book.Are you going to be quizzed on the material? Are you trying to learn a specific skill from the pages? Are you supposed to be paying attention to certain aspects of the book (a character, the way the author uses language, etc.)? Knowing exactly what you need to get out of the reading will help you focus on what’s important and not waste time reading and retaining something immaterial to your goal.

, Whether you use your finger, a piece of a paper, a bookmark, or a pen, a pointer will help guide how much you read.Hold it up to the word or line of text and move it as you complete reading.Sometimes you will want to read faster, sometimes you will want to read slower. The more you use it, the more it will guide how quickly you can read.

, Don’t wait for the story to come to you. Anticipate what is going to happen and what you need to retain, and look for those, whether they are facts, plot points, or important themes., Instead of reading every sentence, let your eyes grab onto the major words. After time you will find that you can take in the bigger meaning of the paragraph with just these few words. You can always quickly rescan if you want to retain more information., Instead of your eye tracking every single word, take advantage of your peripheral vision to see what is coming ahead of time. Begin to see text as a group of words that you can take in all at once., Subvocalization is when you see a word and then think the entire word in your head. If you stop doing this, you will save a lot of time while reading. In order to turn off this part of your mind, you can occupy it with something else, like you can chew gum, counting from one to ten over and over again, or keep repeating a-e-i-o-u in your head., Speed reading is a specific skill that takes practice and dedication. There are many apps and books you can get to help you do this, but it might not be worth it if you need to read a chapter book in 2-3 hours today. Keep in mind that sometimes speed-reading can affect your comprehension, so there is a trade off., Occasionally you will come across an important part of the book. At these places it is important to stop skimming and read more deeply so you will retain more. Reading an important part closely is as important as reading a lot of parts not closely. If you can tell it is an important part of the book, you may want to mark it with a pen, highlighter, pencil, bookmark, or turning the page down., Instead of squeezing your reading time into an already full day, set aside in 2-3 hours of reading like it was an activity or event you need to show up at.By dedicating specific time to reading, you will limit distractions and interferences., You will want to read in a quiet place with no distractions, not a convivial area where you might begin a conversation or get distracted by conversations around you.You might want to go to a library or stay in your house when it is empty. Avoid places that will trigger interruptions or disturbances—you may fall asleep in your bed, you may look for food in a kitchen., Because you will be in one place for several hours, you will want to make sure you are not in pain and will remain comfortable for a long amounts of time.


Pay attention to your posture.
Make sure the lighting is good so you will not strain your eyes.
Make sure you have lower back support, either from a chair, a pillow, or a rolled-up sweatshirt., It will be very tempting to put down the book and do something else. You must resist these distractions and plan for them ahead of time. Turn off your phone. Stay away from a computer, handheld device, video games, or television.Even food can be a distraction. Make sure you have eaten ahead of time or have a snack on hand so that you will not get up and go somewhere else.

, If you are reading in a short amount of time, you will need to stay focused. You should read the book during the time of day you feel most alert.For example, do not begin reading right before you typically go to sleep, or you risk falling asleep. You can also try drinking caffeine or drinking cold water.

Block out distractions while you're reading.,
Nail down the basic questions of the novel before tackling the headier themes.,
Think about the narrator's role in the story, if they have one.,
Think about the style.,
Summarize the main events of each chapter or part once you finish it.,
Read with a partner or group.,
Search for symmetry, coincidence, and common motifs.,
Reconsider the beginning of the novel once you've finished.,
Form your own opinion on the book, but back it up with facts.",How to Read a Novel1," The best novels allow you to sink into them, becoming engrossed in the world of the novel while the outside world drops away. Giving your full attention to a book is the best way to read and understand it, whether you're reading novels or textbooks. Novels, however, are often told in a unique way, meaning you need time to get accustomed to the speaker, the style, and the world of the story to fully grasp them. In general:


Avoid music with lyrics in it while you're reading.
Try to read in blocks, setting aside at least 30 minutes. It is very hard to keep track of things if you're constantly picking the book up and down.
Remove yourself from outside distractions, like a TV or lots of human activity.;
, While some of this may seem obvious, taking five minutes to answer the following questions will give you a great foundation to keep reading. These are the essential parts of the novel, and you need to grasp them before moving on to more difficult discussions:


What does the main character(s) want?
Who is telling the story?
Where and when is the story set? Be specific.
If you're struggling to get the basics, there is no harm in picking up a study guide or reading a plot summary on Wikipedia. This can help you grasp the basic concepts quickly and start looking for nuance.

, Novels are fictional, meaning that, except perhaps in the foreword, the narrator is also fictitious. Is the narrator a part of the story, or are they separate from it? Do they know everything, or just what certain character's know? Most importantly, can you trust the narrator? One of the biggest struggles for many readers is that they trust the narrator too much. Then, when they contradict themselves or make a mistake, it feels like the author made a mistake or that you don't understand the book. However, unreliable narrators are great clues into the meanings of a book -- after all, no real human could ever be a perfect narrator. In general, you should be cautious of any narrator who:


Seems drunk, high, or otherwise drugged (A Clockwork Orange).
Is mentally or socially impaired (The Sound and the Fury, Curious Incident of the Dog at Nighttime).
Has reasons to lie, often because of a crime or wrongdoing (Lolita)., Why is a novel being told the way it is? Is it written in letters, or journal entries, or normal narration? Does the author use big, intimidating words or straightforward, concise sentences? If you're confused, think for a moment about how the story is being told -- it often tells you something about what is being told.


Do you have distance between the events? Does the narrator seem to know what is going to happen, or are you along for the ride together?

, Take a moment to stop and reflect on the events in each chapter. What, exactly, changed from the beginning of the section to the end? Have characters grown? Has the plot thickened? Are you back where you started? Eventually, after you've finished 4-5 chapters, you'll notice that these little summaries form an outline of the novel.


Try and mark how characters change. Once you know how a character has changed throughout a chapter you can start to figure out why they've changed.
If it is not already, try and order the plot chronologically. Stories that are presented out of order, like The Iliad or Absalom! Absalom!"" are often difficult because they are jumbled up, not because the actual plot is complicated., It is impossible to digest all of the complex thoughts, themes, and symbols in a novel all by yourself, especially if you're reading it once. Books should be shared and discussed, so try and convince someone else to read the book along with you. Have discussions at certain points in the book, then talk about it when you've both finished. Between the two (or three, or more) of you, this is often the best way to break down a complex novel without re-reading it., Novels are carefully constructed, and by noting the similarities between characters, chapters, and settings you can get a clue into the overall structure of the book. Just as important are moments that should be similar, but have changed for some reason, such as a character coming back home after a long time away. What things keep popping up in the book? Why do you think they're important?


In The Orphan Master's Son, the idea of movies, actors, and Hollywood shows up repeatedly in the protagonist's early life. This is crucial, but not until the last third of the book.
In The Great Gatsby, there is repeated mention of a blinking light off the coast, and blinking lights reappear several other times. All of these moments are linked by longing for something the character's cannot have., To truly understand and appreciate a novel, you need to consider the entire thing. Moments that fell flat or didn't make sense early on might gain new meaning by the end of the book. Sometimes, the last few pages can complete turn the meaning, plot, or theme of the book around, like in Fight Club or Atonement. Once you've finished a book, skim over your notes or the first chapter again -- do you get a new appreciation for the book?


What would you call the theme of the book? What, ultimately, is the book about?

, Ultimately, once a book is published, it is up for a reader to make their own ""meaning"" out of it. To get the most out of the book (and/or your papers), you need to inject your own personality into the reading. Do you agree with the themes? Do you think the author effectively made you sympathize with the characters, or did you hate them. You can have any opinion you want, but you need to back it up with evidence from the book.


Quotes, summaries, and your notes will form the basis of your case. Whether arguing with a friend or writing a term paper, you should always turn to novel for evidence."

If you take the train to work, you can also read it there, on your way.;
, If you’re reading relaxation or pleasure, then you’re approach might be less structured. If you’re looking for a specific topic or for reading practice, you’ll need to be more organized.


Most English-language newspapers are written at range of reading levels, from about fifth grade to college level, so you should focus on the articles and sections that will probably fit your purpose. For example, the film reviews will be easier, and faster, reading, while reports on complicated economic topics might be more challenging and take more time.Reading a paper to practice a foreign language will help you learn about the issues that are important to speakers of that language and as well as to engage in the culture and learn new vocabulary., After you’ve gotten a sense of the overall paper, choose the section or article that has caught your attention, based on your reading purpose. You might choose a headline article on the front page, or you might skip to another section and begin reading sports. Use the table of contents as your guide.


The editorial section contains opinionated articles rather than strictly factual news, such as the “Opinion” section in the Detroit Free Press, which may offer editorial perspectives on universal healthcare or the War on Terror.The lifestyle section usually has stories about the arts and commerce. Forbes, for example, may have articles about new movies, popular car models, and travel ideas.The entertainment section includes movie and theater reviews, as well as interviews with authors and artists and information about art galleries and other local and national events. Similarly, the sports section will report box scores from sports currently in season, and may include personal stories about players, coaches, or issues in the athletic world, such as the concussion problem in the NFL., If you’re in a crowded space, like a train, fold your newspapers into quadrants for easier reading and less worry about bothering other people.You might find it easier to separate the various sections, usually marked by a letter, and deal with them one at a time, rather than trying to keep all of the pages in order.
Folding a newspaper correctly is optional, although if you’re passing it on to another person, it’s courteous to put all of the sections back in place when you’re done.

, Newspaper articles are usually written in an ""inverted pyramid"" structure, which means that the most significant information appears at the start of the story, rather than the end, followed by the details in order of importance. The first sentence, called the ""lead"" or ""lede,"" is designed to catch readers' attention and provide the major details of the story to entice them to read further.Sidebars near significant stories offer analysis for understanding the ""why"" of the story. Read them first to have some context for the ideas.You can also read the articles’ subheadings or callout quotes, if available, for an overview of major topics and notable comments in the story.

, Read the first few paragraphs, as these will contain the primary points of the article, and you’ll be able to determine if you want to continue reading it. Read the rest of the article or move to a new one if you’ve lost interest or if it doesn’t provide any information that you find worthwhile.


Don’t be afraid to jump to a new article or section if your purpose is satisfied or if you need a break from a difficult topic. For example, you may find reading too much about domestic violence is too distressing for a relaxing read, so you can decide to save an article about an upcoming domestic violence court case for later.
Once you’ve finished with a section, you can set it aside as you find a new place to begin previewing and reading. By the time you’ve read all or most of the sections, you should feel a sense of satisfaction as you collect that new pile of papers for recycling or reuse.

, When you're reading the editorial section, or the ""op-ed"" (opposite the editorial page), remember that you're reading the opinions of those writers, and not necessarily straight facts. Before you begin, you should read the article title to get an idea of the topic, and then take a moment to consider your own opinion first.Even though the news section is strictly informational, being aware of your own opinions and biases before reading those articles will help you to be more open minded about difficult topics.
Try reading opinion pieces that are in opposition to your own views. Even if you don't agree, you might learn something new, whether it's a different way to defend your opinion, or a new perspective on the issue altogether.

, Even if you’re reading to relax, taking a moment to see the relationship between the articles you're reading and your own experiences or concerns can lead to a more enjoyable experience. Ask yourself: “Can I connect the ideas or events that I’m reading about to my own life and the other stories I’ve read about this topic?”Making connections between your TV news and Internet video clips and a printed newspaper will help you to become even more informed about the topic and engaged as a citizen., Sometimes, you may want to read a particularly long newspaper, like the Sunday edition, or you may have a requirement for a course in school. If you have limited time but you want to read the whole paper, your strategy will be different than if you need to read specific sections for an assignment.


If you need or want to read the entire paper, but have only a small window of time, plan to use previewing and skimming strategies.
If you have an assignment or a particular topic you're interested in reading about, then you'll be focused on the finding only the appropriate articles quickly and reading them carefully.

, The front page section is the most valuable “real estate” in the paper, and the editors reserve it for the biggest or most popular stories. Reading the headlines will give you an idea of the most important happenings, either locally, nationally, or internationally, and the images are chosen to establish the central or most interesting idea in a given story.


This overview should take about three minutes, and you'll have a better idea of where you want to start., The most important story, by long newspaper tradition, should appear at the top right of the front page. The second-most important story will appear at the top left. Also, editors use larger type for ""bigger"" stories.Checking the table of contents, if you're looking for a particular topic, section, or article, will save you time, since you won't have to search the newspaper blindly.
Some newspapers include mini-headlines at the very top of the page to catch readers' attention for stories in interior sections of the paper, such as sports or entertainment.<

, Each time you begin a new article, read just the first paragraph or two. Newspaper articles always start with a ""lede"" or ""lead,"" which contains the most important information. The rest of the article fills out the story with details, in order of importance. If you're reading efficiently, the first paragraph should give you enough information for a general understanding of the topic.


If something in an article catches your attention, keep reading, but be ready to move on if your curiosity is satisfied.
If you're reading for an assignment, use the lede to help you set up your summary notes, as it's the ""Main Idea"" of the passage. Articles should answer the questions: ""Who? What? Where? How?,"" so use those questions to structure your notes, if necessary.

, If an article in full contains a ""jump line,"" or instructions to continue the story on another page, complete that story on the new page, and then return to the original section to continue reading. Avoid starting on the new page and possibly wasting time later trying to remember which articles you'd forgotten to read in earlier sections.


You can also simply skim all of the articles, especially if you're in a hurry but want to get a snapshot of the main ideas.
If you're reading for an assignment, or if you have a particular subject of interest, you can also scan all of the articles for key words of your topic. You can then read just those articles more carefully.

, If you have space and want the encouragement that you're reading at a good pace, setting the completed sections aside will provide you with a tangible reminder of your accomplishments.

, Local newspapers, both dailies and weeklies, can connect you to your community’s residents, politics, and happenings, and will be written by local writers with a vested interest in your area. These papers tend to have more reporter-initiated stories rather than mostly stories based on national news, which means they’re more proactive and less “reactive” in nature.Some local news are daily, while others are weekly or bi-weekly. Weekly newspapers will be even more community-centered, since they have more time to fully develop and research local stories.
Local newspapers will employ not only writers from your community, but they will also use community members as sources, and so you may find the stories even more relevant to your own life.

, National news outlets, such as USA Today or The Guardian, will include stories with wider appeal, but many of the stories will be wire-service pieces, such as those from the Reuters or the Associate Press (AP). They’ll include information on national weather trends and major political stories, and they’re more likely to have a significant online presence.


Some very large metro-area newspapers, such as The LA Times or the Chicago Tribune, can be a good blend of local news stories and significant national coverage.
National news outlets may offer more perspectives on many issues, as their staff writers might be located throughout the country, rather than in a single city.

, International newspaper outlets can provide you with a new look at familiar issues or a chance to learn about a different culture. The newspapers of each country or region present their stories from the viewpoint of it’s culture, highlighting the values and positive attributes of that area of the world. If you read critically, you can pay attention to that bias, as well as your own, and gain a new understanding of the truth of a story.Some bias exists in popular newspapers, such as Russia Today and the Australian Associated Press, reporting on war and conflicts, primarily through either overreporting or underreporting of violence. Other issues arise from oversimplification of complicated national and international issues., If you want the top stories, with up-to-the minute information and links to other perspectives on the same issues, try a digital newspaper edition. For possibly more in-depth coverage, including more editorializing or responses from other readers such as letters to the editor, go for print.Not all local papers will have comparable online coverage. For instance, the Community Impact News in Texas, includes only some stories on their website, though they have enormous local print circulation.Some newspapers, particularly national and international papers, will charge a subscription fee for online access. For example, the New York Times charges from $1.88-$8.75 a week for a subscription, depending on your level of access.
Some online news sites, even those with print editions, may use inadequate research and intentionally misleading tactics to encourage traffic to their sites., Newspapers are a mix of factual news and opinionated editorials. A news reporter should offer as many validated and researched facts as available, and an editorial should be clearly marked in a particular section of the paper. Check for credible sources and inappropriate stereotypes in headlines and stories.Ask yourself: “Who is telling the story?” If a story about the economy focuses on stockbrokers instead of the everyday people affected by a recession, the newspaper may not only be biased, but also out of touch with its readers.Find out more about the editorial staff and writers. Do they represent the diversity of the community that they serve? If not, then the stories may show further evidence of bias, particularly on coverage of news on parts of the community not represented at the paper.

Take notes, especially of passages you like or find confusing.,
Apply common literary terms to your analysis.,
Examine the style of the book, and find relationships to other books.,
Find the common bonds between function and form.,
Consult outside sources, from non-fiction research to critical essays.",How to Read a Novel2," It is absolutely essential to take good notes when reading a novel for class. It is doubly important if you need to write an essay on the book later. You should highlight or underline important passages, and provide a brief note to the side reminding you why it is important (""symbolism,"" ""character shift,"" ""repeated metaphor,"" etc.). On paper, you should note bigger moments and shifts -- keeping track of character changes, overarching themes, and passages or moments you don't quite understand yet.


Take notes during class discussion, marking important pages and quotes that you may have missed.
You can go overboard with notes. You want your notes to be a guideline for your writing when you finish the book. If the whole book is underlined you won't get a lot of useful information., Knowing literary vocabulary is the best way to get your point across when writing or talking about a book. It also helps you understand the novel as you're reading, giving a name to the myriad techniques and moments that you encounter so that you can take better notes.



Theme: The overarching ideas, morals, or thoughts of the novel. Can be as simple as ""good beats evil"" and as complex as ""capitalism is destroying the modern family.""

Metaphor: Making two dissimilar things seem similar. ""She is a rose"" doesn't literally mean the woman is a flower, it means she is beautiful, delicate, and a little barbed. A ""simile"" is when the metaphor uses the words ""like"" or ""as,"" ie. ""She is like a rose / She is pretty as a rose.""

Motif: A repeated idea, image, or flavor in a book. If a book frequently uses sailing and ocean metaphors, for example, it could be said to have a ""nautical motif.""

Allusion: A reference to another work, either directly or indirectly. For example, any character that dies and is raised from the dead (A Tale of Two Cities, Harry Potter,) is frequently considered a ""biblical allusion"" to Jesus Christ.

Symbolism: When an object in the book stands for the idea of something else. Symbolism is everywhere, sometimes unintentionally, because humans think in terms of symbols. For example, in Of Mice and Men, the rabbit farm comes to symbolize Lenny's dreams of financial security and safety. A symbol comes to represent a much larger idea than it initially appears., How exactly is the story told? Is there humor, or is it mostly serious? Are the sentences long and difficult or short and speedy? You need to move past the basics of ""what happened"" and onto ""why it happened."" Do you think the author was influenced by other writers, artists, or current events? If so, how do they use fiction to really explore those influences? There are no right answers to these questions, but you need to ask them to get the most out of the novel.


You cannot only worry about plot when reading, as plot is just one of the many pieces that make up a novel. Some teachers encourage reading summaries before starting the book. This helps you pay more attention to characters, themes, and structure, since you know how the plot ends up., Novels work on two levels. The first level is ""function,"" and it concerns what the novel is trying to say (plot, theme, setting, etc.). The second part, ""form,"" is how it is being said (perspective, structure, metaphor, etc.). While good readers will note each side, excellent readers will note how the two of them come together. How does form reinforce function?


David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest is all about the nature of entertainment, debating (in part) if one must work for entertainment. Accordingly, half the novel is written in footnotes, making the reader work by flipping back and forth, even within sentences and other footnotes.
Even less serious books must merge form and function to be successful. Dracula, tells its horrible story as a series of letters and first-hand documents instead of a narrator. This allows Bram Stoker to slowly ratchet up the horror and gives the reader a sense that this really happened somewhere in England., As long as you cite the findings of other authors, one of the best ways to expand your knowledge of a book is to read into the world around it. You could research historical background information, or the author's own life and inspiration. You could read critical essays, which are common for ""classic"" books and can help make sense of complex novels.


When writing longer papers, reading the thoughts of other writers is a great way to form your arguments early on. Do you agree, and have other evidence to offer? Do you disagree, and can you use the book to prove them wrong?
Always cite any outside sources you've read and expand on them with your personal opinions. Use these sources as a jumping off point, not your only argument."

Smuggle it into your house.,
Find a good hiding place.,
Read the book.,
Return the book.,
If you didn't check out the book to begin with, return it exactly where you left it.,
Return to normal life.",How to Read a Forbidden Book," The library is excellent for this. Try to go to a library where you aren't well known. Don't bring attention to yourself with your clothing or actions. Avoid leaving a trail for investigators. For instance, do not ask librarians where to find the book or search for it in the card catalogue. If you're serious about stealth, don't even check out the book. Just read it at the library. Another way, would be to obtain a digital copy of the book by searching it online in google and then buying an e-book version of it. Reading on your laptop or tablet helps to read in privacy too.;
, Hide it under your coat, in your pocket, or in a bag. Take it into a secure location where you know you will not be found or seen.

, Avoid the obvious, like underneath your pillow or in your hands. Sometimes burying it underneath clothing is effective if your dresser is never touched by others. If you share a room, make sure your roommate will not go through your stuff.

, Do it alone whenever possible. Read it in the bathroom, but remember not to stay locked in for too long. Read it outside, in empty parks or hiking trails. Make sure you always have an alibi.

, Drop it off as quietly and casually as possible. Act like it's an ordinary book. Place it face down on the counter, preferably underneath other books. Turn the spine away from others. You may want to stick around for a few minutes instead of suspiciously dashing away.

, Make sure no one else is in sight when you do this.

, Never quote the book or act knowledgeable about anything pertaining to it. This is often the hardest step because you will want to talk about your adventure. If you must talk about it, choose someone you trust or do it anonymously.

Take your time.",How to Read a Chapter Book (for Children)," First off, when you read picture books, do you usually read with an adult, or by yourself? To read a chapter book, you must be able to know simple words and read simple, short picture books by yourself. Chapter books may have a few words you do not know, but stick with it, because you are soon going to grow out of eight page picture books.
, You can use that short story as your warm up before stepping into a bigger book. Once you have read that picture book, go ask your Mom or Dad or guardian to bring you to a library and get a chapter book that catches your interest, or your funny bone, or search for a nice, interesting chapter book where you are, if there are books in the place you are., Okay, so, once you have a chapter book, open the book to the first chapter, and try the first page, and if you need to stop, or take a break, that is fine., Remember, don't get frustrated over one word, or one sentence you don't understand. It will be okay. If you need help, ask someone around you., Don't finish the book all in one period of time. That is rushing, and you will skip over words. Chapters books aren't meant to be read in such a small space of time, so go slowly with it."

Be clear why you are using a quotation.,
Work them into your text so they read like normal sentences.,
Use brackets and ellipses to add or subtract words.",How to Quote a Book1," A quotation should provide a new point of view, or bolster a point you are trying to make. Elaborate on the quoted text, provide context, and explain why it supports your argument.Quotations are often used to support ideas that might be disputed or are not common knowledge. An idea like, “Most people never live to see 100,” doesn’t need to be backed up by a quotation, but something like, “Many writers have described the power of fiction,” should probably be supported with quotations.
One can sometimes emphasize a particular point by backing it up with a quotation from a particularly impressive author.
Quotations can also add stylistic flare to your prose. For example, a sentence like, “When Shakespeare “shuffled off this mortal coil,” he likely had no idea the impact his work would make on Western culture” is a bit more interesting than if the same sentence started simply, “When Shakespeare died…”;
, To do this, you will usually use a signal phrase like, “According to the author,” or something to that effect. Thus, “Nick Caraway describes humans as, “boats against the current,”” works, while “Nick Caraway has a sad view of people, “boats against the current,”” does not.If you are having trouble deciding if you’ve incorporated a quotation correctly, try reading it aloud to yourself. It can be easier to tell if a sentence works when you speak it.
Some examples of verbs used in signal phrases are claims, adds, writes, argues, asserts, confirms, points out, admits, concludes, observes, and implies., Sometimes a quotation will support your argument perfectly, but be impossible to work into your text without making changes. In such cases, you will need to use brackets or ellipses.Insert new words into quotations by putting them inside brackets.
Remove existing words by replacing them with an ellipsis.
Note that this is only appropriate if you maintain the basic meaning of the quotation. It should not be used to twist an author’s words into something other than what she intended.
As an example, one could change the Nabokov quotation, “…art--not an ""escape"" (which is only a cleaner cell on a quieter floor), but relief from the itch of being,” into the sentence, “…art not an “escape”…but relief from the itch of being.”

Insert short quotations into the body of the paragraph.,
Make long quotations into freestanding blocks of text.,
Include an in-text citation after the quotation.,
Make a Works Cited page.,
Put the full citation in your Works Cited page.",How to Quote a Book2," A quotation shorter than four lines of prose or three lines of verse does not need to be its own freestanding block of text. It can simply be incorporated into the paragraph in which you are using it. It should begin and end with double quotation marks., When quoting an excerpt longer than four lines of prose or three lines of verse, start by writing a signal phrase introducing the quotation, as you would with a shorter one. Begin the quotation on a new line below this.Indent the whole quotation one inch from the left.
Double-space it (in an MLA style research paper, everything should be double spaced).
Do not use quotation marks.

, The author’s last name and the page on which the quotation can be found should be included in parenthesis at the end of the quotation, before the next punctuation mark. This is called a parenthetical citation, and will help your reader locate the full citation in your bibliography or works cited page.For example: ""Maybe the best definition of art is simply “beauty plus pity” (Nabokov 251).""
If you reference the author’s name before the quotation, you don’t need to repeat it in the parenthesis following the quote. For example: ""Nabokov defined art as “beauty plus pity” (251).""

, This should begin on a separate page at the end of your research paper or essay. Label it “Works Cited,” in centered, non-italic text (without the quotation marks) at the top of the page.Double-space the page, but do not skip spaces between citations.
Do not indent the first line of each citation, but indent all subsequent lines by 0.5 inches from the left.

, Order your citations alphabetically by the authors’ last names. The basic format of an MLA style book citation is: Lastname, Firstname. Title of Book. City of Publication: Publisher, Year of Publication. Medium of Publication.There are many variations on this basic format based on factors like how many authors the book has, and whether it is something like anthology, an ebook, or a self-published book.

Double-space it (in an APA style paper, everything should be double spaced).
Do not use quotation marks.

, You need to cite the author, year of publication, and page number (preceded by “p.”) The best way to do this is to use a signal phrase with the author’s name in it, followed by the date of publication and the page number in parenthesis. For example: “Smith (2011) insists that, “Quoting books is not difficult, but it can take time to get the hang of” (p. 15).”If the author’s name is not included in the signal phrase, include the author’s last name, the year of publication, and the page number (all separated by commas) in the parenthetical citation following the quotation. For example: “He insists that “Quoting books is not difficult, but it can take time to get the hang of” (Smith, 2011, p. 15).”

, This should begin on a separate page at the end of your research paper or essay.

Avoid going into it without practice.",How to Read a Book in a Week," Once you have an idea of how many hours per week will be required to complete your book, you’ll be more likely to choose a book that can be reasonably read within a week. Don’t choose a short story that can be read in 30 minutes; likewise don’t read an 800 page book that will take 13-14 hours to complete if you don’t have the time nor patience. Timing is especially relevant when you have a deadline such as an assignment for school.


Also consider your history with reading. If you are used to reading only one 400 page book per month, try to choose a book that is a fraction of that size, like 150-200 pages. This allows your goal to be realistic while still challenging.;
, If you have a choice, pick a book that will really pique your interest instead of choosing a boring book that will only make you want to stop reading. Try one from your favorite author, read a review online, choose based on recommendations from others, or choose based on your personal interest in subjects.Many people read a variety of subjects as a means to get better at being a human and being a life-long learner.Try keeping a reading list of books that you want to read. Whenever you come across a book that interests you, update your list so you always have something interesting from which to choose., There are many times people are unable to choose their reading material because it has been assigned to them for school, work, or other projects. Even if you find yourself hating the material, set a plan in motion to keep reading. Keep in mind that even if you don’t like something, you can always learn from it, which is usually the goal. Not only will it be preparing you for an immediate gain (like a good grade on a test), but it will also provide you with knowledge of a person or topic of which you were previously unaware.Even if you feel the text doesn’t keep your attention, you can always focus on what worked or didn’t work, what the author did well and what they didn’t. Not only will this show a deep analysis of the text, but it will also help you in determining what books you prefer to read.
Commit to your goal. If you are forced to read an assigned book within a week’s time, prepare yourself by truly committing to the goal. Always remind yourself of what depends on your completion of the book (a grade, a report, a presentation, etc.).

, This is especially helpful if you have an assignment due date or if you consider yourself a weak-willed individual. Having a routine in place will help you to stick with reading and help you reach your goal. Learning your reading speed will help you determine how many hours it will take you to complete the book.Learn how fast you read. Determining how many words per minute (wpm) you are able to read will help you to determine what size book to choose as well as how much time per day should be spent reading.Time required can fluctuate based on the difficulty of the text, but having an idea of how long it will take will give you a measurable goal to work with.
Choose the right time of day to read. You should always choose the time of day when you have the most energy so you’ll be more focused and more prepared to learn. Try treating it like an appointment and schedule time with yourself each day to read.Wake up, take a shower, and read while eating breakfast; or stop at your favorite coffee shop on the way to work and spend 30 minutes reading while enjoying your coffee. By putting everything in its “proper place,” you’ll be more likely to stick to your assigned task

, The more you read, the more you will enjoy reading. Try to sit alone and read for at least 10 minutes before taking a break. Before you know it, those 10 minutes will have passed and you’ll be hooked.The more you learn to read for pleasure, the easier it becomes. Keep in mind the number of pages or chapters you need to read daily to meet your goal.


After your goal of 10 minutes, aim for reading one to two chapters. By then, your interest will have been piqued and you’ll want to continue reading without checking the time., Aside from your scheduled time, use your free time to read a few extra pages or chapters. Instead of checking Facebook or playing games on your phone, use the extra 5-10 minutes to catch up on your reading.


Depending on how often you read, you can add an extra 30 minutes to 1 hour each day. This equates to an increase of about 5 hours per week.Carry your book anywhere you go so you will always be prepared to read. Use your phone or an electronic reading device such as a Kindle to always have a book at your fingertips.If you’re on a deadline, remove distracting apps from your phone for the week.Even if you’re only able to read ahead a few pages, you’ll still be ahead of your goal which can boost your confidence and give you a rewarding feeling., If you are falling behind in your reading and have a deadline to meet, feel free to skim over a few pages. Read the first few pages of the chapter and look for the main idea of the chapter and how it fits into the flow of the book.Look for any important plot points or new characters that will be helpful in later chapters.


Skim headings and subheading to search for organization and main ideas.
Read the first and last sentence of each paragraph. If you are able to abstract the meaning, move on; otherwise, it may be necessary to read the entire paragraph., No matter what happens, don’t stop reading. If your deadline is approaching and you feel like you won’t reach your goal, continue pushing and read as much as you can. If you don’t have a deadline, continue your routine and determine how long it actually takes you to finish reading the book. This will help you in being able to realistically set future reading goals.

, Once you fall behind in your reading it is hard to catch up. Try not to “owe yourself one” or think that you’ll double up on time later.This can cause people to feel overwhelmed and helpless, and can cause people to give up instead of pushing forward.


Try sticking to a schedule and routine to avoid falling behind.
If you do fall behind, make a realistic plan about how to get back on track. Give up television for one evening or take your book to the gym to make up time.
Be sure to control your emotions if you find yourself behind in your goal. Keep from feeling overwhelmed and hopeless by putting a realistic plan into action.The best way to avoid this feeling is to stay ahead of your reading at all times.

, Get rid of any outside source that has the potential to steal your attention away from your book. Turn off your laptop, close yourself in your bedroom, turn off the television, and leave your phone on the charger.Make this time an important priority over everything else.

, If you read while tired, you’ll either fall asleep within a few pages or you won’t retain any important information. Instead of reading at the end of the day when you’re drained, try reading as early in the day as possible when your mind is still fresh and fully functioning.Being comfortable is a major part of reading; but being comfortable and tired is usually a recipe for disaster. Avoid reading in bed unless it has become habit or part of your winding down routine for bedtime.

, Attempting to read a book in a week without previous practice can be a difficult task. By reading and sharpening your learning skills, you are able to practice your ""meta-skills"" and become more proficient in learning, reading, remembering and thinking.If possible, try to increase your reading skills before setting your goal to read a book in a week.


This practice can be equated to cutting wood. If you have wood to cut you must first sharpen your saw when cutting the first log, not the last.You can build your skills by reading more (not just books), reading often, or trying a speed reading program."

Jump around.,
Read interactively.,
Take notes.,
Read by chapter.,
Keep up.",How to Read a Book," If you're reading for your own enjoyment, you'll probably want to pick a general interest fiction or nonfiction book. There are literally millions of such books, so finding one that's right for you can be challenging. A good place to start is by thinking about what you like, and also about what you don't like. Keep in mind how many different types of books are out there. There are dystopian books like The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. There are realistic fiction books such as Perfect by Natasha Friend. There are fantasy books like The Land of Stories by Chris Colfer. There are historical fiction books like Dragonwings by Laurence. Yep, and so many others.


Knowing your personal taste can really help you find a book you'll find enjoyable. Just because someone else says a book is good doesn't mean you'll necessarily enjoy it. Some people enjoy fantasy novels, other people hate them. Think about what kind of an experience you want to have while reading. Do you want a rousing adventure tale? A cerebral exploration of ideas? An emotional journey through the lives of believable characters? How long of a book do you want to read? How challenging do you want it to be? Are there certain perspectives you want your book to embrace or avoid? Answering these questions will narrow down the field of possible books.
Nonfiction books can be a little easier to narrow down than fiction ones. Most popular nonfiction books are histories or biographies of famous people. Is there a famous person you'd like to know more about? Do you want to know more about a country, a landmark, a war, a historical event? Do you want to know more about oceans, or dinosaurs, or pirates, or stage magic? Pretty much anything you can think of has had a nonfiction book written about it.

Just because you find a nonfiction book about something that interests you doesn't necessarily mean you'll like the book. Some books are well written and interesting, others are poorly written and boring. If you find a nonfiction book about something you like, read the first couple of pages first to see if you like the writer's style. If you find the book difficult or boring on the first page, it probably won't get any better as you read through.


Go to the library. Your local library is a good place to browse books, since if you see one that interests you, you won't even have to pay anything to read it. Tell the librarian what you're interested in, and ask him or her to point you to one or two areas of the library where you might find interesting books related to your interests.
Don't judge the book by its cover. The title and cover illustrations may seem boring or not your taste, but inside the book could be a whole world of pleasure and enjoyment that you will be enthralled by. This, however, is not always the case, so make sure you pick wisely! Also, look at the thickness of the book. If a quick read is what you're looking for, a big, heavy book wouldn't be suitable, and vice versa. Lastly, if you are buying the book for someone other than yourself, think about their age and interests, if you are purchasing for a child, young adult books such as Fifty Shades of Grey may not be the ideal choice.
Ask those around you. Good friends and close relatives may be able to recommend books to you based on what they enjoyed and thought you would also enjoy. But be careful because some people like to read long stories while others don't. If you love science for example, search for science books.
Check online. The Internet is filled with book lovers who are more than happy to share their opinions about various titles. Find a community that discusses books and search for the subjects you like, or just visit online retail sites and browse user reviews of books that look good. Either way is a great method for getting a quick idea of the most popular and best-liked titles in any category of book.
Make it a group event. Book clubs and readings are both fun ways to expose yourself to new books.

Many clubs are focused around a particular genre of book, such as science fiction or romance, but some are more general.
Fiction readings happen regularly at many independent bookstores.
Nonfiction writers can sometimes be found giving readings or even free guest lectures at nearby colleges. Go and listen to see if their book sounds like something you would like to read, and learn a little about something that interests you at the same time. Some books starts with brief explanation so don't get bored after the first few pages; remember every story has a lesson.

;
, There are a few different ways to accomplish this:


Check out the book from the library. The upside of this approach is that it's free and easy. If you don't have a library membership, just walk into the library and ask for one.

Many library systems allow you to electronically reserve a copy of a book you want in advance, and then notify you when the book is available so you can come check it out.
Be aware that if you're trying to read a very popular book, you may end up weeks or months down the waiting list for a copy.


Buy the book. Visit a bookstore or newsstand and purchase your own copy to keep for as long as you like. The advantage of this method is that with a little work, you can usually find even the hottest books and read them right away; the downside is that you have to pay money to buy the book.

Since you're paying, be sure to pick up the book and read a few pages of it in the store first, so you can tell if you'll enjoy the author's writing style when you crack it open at home.


Borrow the book. Friends and relatives who recommend a book to you will often have their own copy and be glad to led it to you for as long as it takes you to finish.

Be sure to take good care of books you have been loaned, and read them in a timely fashion so you don't forget about them and leave them gathering dust on a shelf for the next year.


Electronically purchase the book. With the advent of portable e-readers and smartphones over the last several years, electronically published editions of print books are becoming more and more common. It also means that the book can be taken with you anywhere where your phone/kindle/tablet/iPod is.

The cost of purchasing a virtual book is often slightly less than the cost of purchasing a physical copy, so if you have a reader already, you might save a little cash. Don't buy huge books if you know you won't finish it. good types of apps for these are the Kindle apps or if you have a new version of an iProduct, iBooks.
Like a paper-and-ink book, an electronic book is yours to keep once you've paid for it. The only downside to this is that, unlike paper books, you cannot pawn them off because the book is installed in your device.
Remember that electronic editions are more difficult than regular books to bring with you on long vacations or camping trips.



, Find a comfortable place to sit, make sure there's plenty of light, and open the front cover. Start at the beginning, which is usually the first chapter unless there's some front material, and read each page in order until the book is finished. If there is any end material, wait until you have finished the rest of the book before reading it.


Decide whether or not to read the front material. Front material is the writing at the front of the book that isn't the first chapter of the book. It comes in four basic flavors, and each type serves a different purpose. You can decide on your own whether or not you want to read any given section of front material. The four types of front material are:

Acknowledgments: A brief section that lists people who helped the author in some way during the writing process. You can read acknowledgments if you like, but most people don't bother. Acknowledgments also commonly appear at the very end of the book.
Foreword: The foreword is written by a different author than the person who wrote the book, so it is usually only seen in later editions of a book that has made some sort of impact in the past, such as an award-winning novel or an important scientific work. The foreword talks a bit about what to expect from the book, and why it is worth reading.
Preface: The preface is written by the author of the book. It is usually (but not always) shorter than the foreword, and is basically an essay that explains how and why the book was written. If you're interested in the author's personal life or creative process, the preface can give you some valuable insight.
Introduction: The introduction is the place where the author speaks directly to the reader and introduces the book, reviewing what its intent is and building excitement in the reader about getting to read it. Introductions are more often found in nonfiction books than fiction books. If you would rather not know a few things in the book before, reading the writers prelude after would be a good idea.


Decide whether or not you want to read the end material. End material is other writing, typically by different authors, that appear after the main book has ended.

End material is typically comprised of essays or editorials on the book itself, and is not commonly seen outside of academic “study editions” of certain very famous books, such as John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath.
As with most front material, all end material is totally optional.
If you greatly enjoyed a book, end material can give you a chance to revisit parts of it; if you didn't understand the importance of a book, it can provide important historical and cultural context. Otherwise, most people ignore it.



, Reading a really good book is an absorbing experience that makes time fly by. Have a bookmark ready, and be sure that you don't spend too long reading in one sitting. (Set a timer on your phone or watch if you have to.) This will allow you to enjoy the book longer, and prevent you from missing deadlines or shirking other responsibilities because you were lost in your book.

, Most books that are comprised of many smaller pieces have a clear table of contents to facilitate quickly jumping to a particular piece. Some also have an index at the end, which will list keywords and other important terms along with page numbers where each one appears.


An effective way to jump into a book of poems or essays is to pick one that sounds interesting and flip to it, rather than starting at the very beginning. You can read this item first and decide how you feel about it, then adjust your browsing method accordingly to find more of what you like and save the boring or less-impressive stuff for last.

, Aside from book-length poems (like William Carlos Williams' Paterson, or Homer's Iliad), most collections of shorter writing can be read in any order you like. Skim and flip through the book, stopping whenever something catches your interest.


Make the experience your own. Approach it according to your personal whims instead of just trying to read straight through it. You will be surprised and delighted at every turn, instead of feeling like you have to slog through things that don't interest you and wait for the good part to come later.
Keep your eyes open. As you become more attuned to the tone of the book, items that seemed dull before will start to get interesting, so you'll always have something more to read.

, Inhabit the writing inside the book and make it a part of your own life by emphasizing your favorite parts. You will enjoy it much more than if you try to dryly deconstruct it or push through it in a linear fashion.


Keep track of what you read. Write down page numbers or author names for items you particularly enjoy so that you can revisit them easily in the future.
Use a pencil. If you own the book, consider lightly marking it with a pencil wherever you see a line or a word that grabs your attention.

, It is possible to read a textbook for fun, but the practice is not very common. Most people read a textbook because they need to get information, and textbooks are an excellent source of concentrated, clearly-organized information on many topics. To get the most from reading your textbook, have a notepad open beside you while you read.


Set a pattern. Read one paragraph at a time, then stop and make a note about what that paragraph said. Try to put it into one or two quick phrases or sentences.
Review your results. At the end of your session, you'll have a personal copy of all the information you need. Read over it to ensure that everything makes sense to you.

, In most cases, it isn't necessary to read a textbook straight through from start to finish, but it isn't very useful to jump from section to section, either. Instead, every time you have to read even part of a chapter, if you haven't done so already, plan to read that entire chapter.


Understand more of what you read. Reading the whole chapter in order once will put all the information you need into a solid context, making it easier to understand and easier to remember.
Take a victory lap. There's no need to read back through the whole chapter once you've done it the first time. You can cherry-pick from the chapter as needed afterward.

, If you're reading a textbook, it's probably for a class you're trying to pass. Textbooks are dense, slow reads, so the best way to tackle them is to start early and try to make steady progress every time you open one up.


Make it a date. Schedule regular space at least a few days a week to read your textbook, and it'll go by much more easily than if you tried to cram it all in right before each test.

Know yourself to find a balance.,
Read just enough that you can implement: Information in self help books cannot be digested like a novel, so you'll get more out of them by focusing on some information a day and trying to digest that information before you go onto the next part.,

Be a student.,

Effectiveness lies in the balance. Balance says 'how much I can read and apply it immediately without losing something I read', so try to find a balance remember. Again effectiveness lies in the balance.;
,


If there are exercises along the way, such as journaling or reflection, try to do them on the day when you read the chapter that talks about them, when the instructions and purpose are fresh in your mind.

, Try to find information and quotes from the book that can help you in your life. These quotes can serve as motivation as you proceed. Do not simply read; try to find the inner meanings of the information and understand its purpose.

, Get a notepad before you start and write anything you find interesting into your notepad or get a highlighter and highlight all the main facts or information you find interesting in the book.

, To make the implementation process organized, make a list consisting of things from the book to implement. For example suppose you learned about the concept of making people important genuinely, then you are more likely to succeed if you apply it right away without giving much time between getting the information and implementation of it.

, Self help books contain advice, and are therefore written for a general audience. The authors do not know you personally, or your situation. As a simple example, many excellent gardening books are written in Vermont, but the information and advice in them may be completely inappropriate for California's climate and soils. Here are some things to ask yourself as you read:


Does the author have personal experience with this subject?
Does the author have scientific or professional experience with this subject, or has he/she consulted the literature?
Is the advice and experience recommended in the book relevant to your situation?
Does the advice make sense, and does it make sense in your own life?
How is the author motivated? Are they selling anything besides books? If the book gives financial advice, does the author use it him/herself, and does he/she stand to gain from others' following the advice?
Is the book well regarded in the community? Why or why not?
How do other works in the same subject area compare? Do they take similar approaches?

, Most successful people are those who implement it as soon as they learn something. This may sound like a cliché but the quicker you apply a concept after learning it the better you would be able to the grasp of it. For example if you learn about dance move and if you tried it right away without much delay, more quickly and easily you will learn it easily as compared to when you try to practice it after a delay. #

, A car without an engine will not work. Similarly, an idea without hard work will not work. When you read self help books and develop a new idea, work hard to make that idea reality, lest it remain an idea.

, Some people do not focus, even when it is something that could change a life. Thus, read in a peaceful environment, as with any other book, and give the information your full attention. Read at a time and in an environment that encourages you to stay awake. Do not neglect important information.

, Get a meeting place for your group and each time you meet up, read a chapter of the book and discuss the information. Give a notepad and pencil, and take turns sharing your thoughts.

, What worked? What still needs work? Did you stick with the latest part of the plan? A little accountability can really help you get going.

, If something which you learn you find good, share it with your friends and relatives and people who would be interested. This is not only a good thing to do but would also help you to grasp the concept better.

, Small steps add up to big results. Remember the tortoise and the hare? The tortoise won the race because the hare became exhausted quickly. For the tortoise to win the race, there are a couple of things he needs to do.


Stick his neck out and get going.

Keep at it.
Identify and follow the correct path.

, So you started the program, and you see yourself getting stuck, or veering off course. Ask yourself why. Do you need to work harder? Do you need to work on smaller, more manageable parts? Is there information you're still missing? Do you hate what you're doing? If so, is it because you're trying to accomplish something difficult (such as quitting smoking), or because what you're trying to do isn't right for you? Your group can help you sort out these parts, also.

Get out the word and set the rules.,
Post your rules first.,
Make sure everyone knows before putting up the form for submitting characters is that if their character gets eliminated from the Selection, or dies (read: Southern Rebels), that is entirely under your control.,
Post the form for entering the Selection.,
Remember you only need 35 girls from 16 to 20.,
Start figuring out what these characters are going to do, who'll be sent home, and so on.,
Be mindful of people's feelings.,
Make sure it doesn't take 50 chapters to narrow down to the Elite.",How to Host a Selection SYOC," If you're hosting a traditional Selection, you're only going to need 35 submissions, all girls and preferably not Mary Sues (perfect, beautiful, and powerful people). You'll need to find a place where you can post the rules your players must abide by, the form they must fill for a character, and the actual story. If you want it to be public, use sites like fanfiction.net and Quotev. If you want it to only be available to a set number of people, use private texting or email.;
, A SYOC is different from a roleplay in that in a roleplay, each person controls their character. In a SYOC, the person writing the story is in full control of all your characters. Make sure everyone understands this before starting. Also post a little backstory.


If the competition is for Maxon, everyone knows him. However, if it's a different prince, you're going to need to post a little bit of backstory. Since in the Selection series King Clarkson did not allow girls under caste 5, you need to show the treatment of the castes if there are any (Maxon and America eliminated them).

, If their character gets to the Elite, you can give them a little more leeway in the story, but that is optional.

, If you want, you could copy the letter and form from the book, or make up your own. No matter which one you do, it should contain a space for the name, province (one from each, you might need to move people around) caste (again, if there are castes), age (must be 16 to 20), looks, and personality.


You don't want everyone to be perfect little angels, because where's the fun in that? On the other hand, what happens to these characters should be appropriate for the rating you give the story.

, It's only fair to put in the first 35 people with characters who have your entire sheet filled out. If somebody didn't fill out vital information (ex. name) feel free to skip over their's, because no name means no identity. If you handpick people (like King Clarkson) inform everyone. Otherwise you will just be seen as rude.

, Having eliminations is mandatory, as is the Report where they announce the names, and the Convicting for the Elite. Besides that, have fun! America and Maxon took walks, there was hunting, the roof, Princess Eadlyn's Game Show, and tea. Remember to update regularly.

, It might hurt to have their character eliminated on the first day, or be sent home for breaking the rules. But these are your characters now, and you have every right to eliminate some.

, When it does happen, though, make sure the prince meets the Elite's parents. If no one minds, you could do it at  a Halloween Ball. Just make sure the timeline is clear.

Cry as much as you want.,
Allow yourself to feel angry.,
Write a letter to your character.,
Give yourself time.,
Practice self-care.,
Don’t judge yourself.,
Talk to friends.,
Find fans online.",How to Get Over the Death of a Fictional Character1," Don’t think that just because the character is fictional, it’s silly to cry. People can go through a similar mourning process for fictional characters as they do for real people in their life, though it may be less extreme. Know that you are completely justified in your sadness and don’t try to suppress feelings of grief. , You might be angry that your character has died. Sometimes character deaths come out of the blue and may seem completely unnecessary. You may be furious at the author, or at another character who may have caused their death. Let yourself feel these emotions and express them in a healthy way. Exercise as a way to let out your anger. Even taking a brisk walk to clear your head can help. Talk about your anger. Either with other fans or with friends and family, talk about how unjust it was for this character to die. This can help you work through your feelings of anger.

, Sometimes we feel extreme grief over the loss of a character because we don’t have the opportunity to tell them how important they are to us. Writing a letter to your favorite fictional character is a way to feel that you have directly expressed to them your love and your sadness over their death. You may feel silly at first writing to a fictional character. But writing is proven to be very therapeutic, especially when you write directly to someone and express your feelings. , Don’t expect to feel better immediately. Grief is a process that takes different amounts of time for everyone. Especially if this death came out of the blue, it can take a while to feel stable and better. Whenever you catch yourself thinking that you should be over the death, remember that there is no correct timetable to get over your sadness. , Pamper yourself a little bit as you are grieving for this character. This is an important way of acknowledging to yourself that you are going through a difficult time. Do one thing a day, whether it be eating your favorite food or sleeping in a little, to give yourself a little boost. , At one point or another, everyone has felt the loss of a fictional character. Just because they are not real, that does not mean you don’t form attachments to them. In fact, being sad at a character’s death is human and it shows that you have a big capacity for empathy. , If you have friends who have read the book or watched the movie or series with your character, talk to them about how sad you are. An important step in getting over grief is to express it. People who are close to you are a great resource because they love and understand you. , Sometimes it’s helpful to find people outside your circle who were also affected by the character’s death. It’s been proven that belonging to fan communities can provide you strong emotional support. Talking to fellow fans will help you get your emotions out of your system and make you feel like you aren’t alone in feeling upset or sad. Engage with other fans on official or fan websites. Many of these have discussion boards where you can talk about the death of your character.
Be careful about what information you give about yourself. Don’t give out personal information like your phone number. Consider using a pseudonym when talking with other fans.

Start promoting your book before contacting bookstores to show that you're serious, then continue promoting it and directing potential customers to the stores that are willing to stock your book.,
Ask the store to order your book from their distributors.,
If they aren't interested in stocking physical copies - or even if they are, in ADDITION to the print copies - ask about opportunities to promote the eBook version.,
Identify the bookstore contact person.,
Be professional and respectful.,
Follow up.,
Be as professional at the end as at the beginning.,
Respect staff time.,
Continue marketing.",How to Get a Self Published Book Into Bookstores,"


Create a website or blog for the book.

Create a press kit. Describe the book and provide contact information. Include only the most influential or glowing reviews. Leave out irrelevant information such as your personal resume. You have about 60 seconds to make an impression with it, so make sure your strongest selling points are on the first page.
Send press releases to local newspapers and bookstores. It will be much more effective if you send these to individual contact people, so make some phone calls or do some research to find out the specific person who reviews books in each company.
Advertise in local publications. Let your bookstore contact person know that you're marketing the book locally. Offer to put an ""available at ..."" line in future ads if they will accept the book for sale.
Contact local TV and radio stations for interviews. Again, having the name of a contact person will make your efforts more productive. If you have mutual friends, ask them to recommend you to media people they know.
Offer to hold author readings at libraries and writing conferences to increase your visibility.
Create fliers containing information about your book. Include the ISBN and a brief synopsis. Leave the flyers on public bulletin boards to create local interest.
Enlist your network. Ask your friends, neighbors, family, and co-workers-to request the book at their local bookstores. Then resist the temptation to sell your book to those people yourself. Ask them to wait to buy it from the store so that there is a history of good sales.;
, If your book is available through national distributors such as Ingram or Baker & Taylor, the bookstore can order directly from the distributor and may be willing to do so just from a phone call. Taking books one-at-a-time on consignment from the author, on the other hand, is much more time-consuming (and thus less profitable) for bookstores than going through an established distributor, which automates reordering, returns, and payments.

, Through a partnership between the American Booksellers Association (local independent bookstores) and Kobo Inc, bookstores can sell eBooks and earn a percentage of all device and eBook sales.

, If you are distributing your book yourself, call the bookstore and ask who handles their ""consignment"" or ""local author"" books. Start with chain bookstores to get experience with the process; then approach independent bookstores, which are more likely to have a Local Authors section. If you are a local author, the bookstore will be more likely to accept your book as a community service than if you're some distant author who will not be doing local promotion. Ask if you can make an appointment to come in and show them the book.

, At your meeting with the bookstore contact, distinguish yourself from pushy self-published authors by being easy to work with.


When contacting the bookstore, saying that your book is available through online-only booksellers or your personal website is not a selling point; compared with reputable publishers, these methods are used heavily for the ""vanity"" publishing of books that did not have high enough quality for traditional publishing.
Although you may be a long-time customer of that bookstore, you are now the seller and they are the customer. It's fine to say that you love the store (if you do), but don't pressure them to take your book just because you've bought a lot of books from them in the past.
Be prepared to leave a copy of the book with the manager or buyer for evaluation. Let them know that you would be available for author signings and readings when the time comes (meaning ""if the book sells"").
Ask the bookstore contact person if they would like a complimentary copy of the book, but don't ask them to read it; they will read your book if they are interested in it.
It is naive to suggest that the store should put your book on their Staff Recommendations shelf, or that they display it at the front counter. Marketing decisions are made by the bookstore, and only amateurs ask to be placed on the store's top-selling, most visible locations before there is a history of strong sales.
Do not presume to tell a bookstore that they will ""sell a lot of copies."" That is out of your hands. Let your results speak for themselves.

, Check back periodically with the stores that have taken the book and ask if they need more copies. (Every 6-8 weeks is sufficient.)

, Don't be grudging when the contract time is up and the store asks you to take back unsold copies. They took a chance, and if the book didn't sell, it is largely because the author didn't promote it or send people in to look at it. If you're cheerful and respectful, the bookstore will be much more likely to accept your future work.

, If you're in a busy bookstore, get in and out as quickly as you can. Once the store accepts the book, you no longer need to ""sell"" it by talking about yourself or the book. It's actually counter-productive to monopolize staff time and doesn't work to get the staff to hand-sell your book. Like every other reader, the bookstore contact person will take a quick look at the book and make their own buying/reading decisions.

, Once you've gotten your self-published book into bookstores, don't stop working. Push the book as hard as you did before to encourage people to buy it. Your book will be restocked, especially by larger chain bookstores, only if sales are good.

Reread or re-watch your favorite scenes.,
Emulate the character.,
Remember their impact.,
Reconsider their death.",How to Get Over the Death of a Fictional Character2," Revisiting your character when they were alive and happy is a great way to make you feel less sad. It’s comforting to know that even though they eventually die, you can always go back and spend time with them. , There are qualities that you love and admire about your favorite character. Try to incorporate them into your daily life.


If you admire the character’s kindness, try to be kind and generous. This is a way of letting the character’s legacy live on.You can even emulate your character in every day kinds of ways. If your character liked to take long walks or to drink coffee, try these things out. They will make you feel closer to your character and it will help you to understand them in a different way.

, Think about your favorite character and the impact they made not only on you, but on other characters. The story would not be the same without this character, and even though they are gone you still can remember all the good that they did for the book or show. , Maybe you feel like their death was unnecessary or wrong. However, most authors kill off characters for a reason. Often it’s to spur other characters into action. Although the death of your fictional character was devastating, maybe it was necessary for the plot or for the other characters of the story.


Just because the death happened for a reason, it doesn’t mean you have to be any less sad about it. It may just be comforting to know that they didn’t die in vain.

Write fan fiction.,
Read fan fiction.,
Make fan art.,
Write a fan song.",How to Get Over the Death of a Fictional Character3," Write fan fiction about your favorite character. You can fill in the gaps in their life that the writer didn’t cover. Or you can even write them an alternate ending to their story. This is a powerful way of engaging with the character and keeping them alive in your life. One reason why you may be so affected by the character’s death is because you felt like a spectator in their life. Writing fan fiction gives you an outlet to engage with your character directly and even to control their fate. , If you’re not the writing type, read fan fiction. Nowadays many books, television series and movies have fan fiction based on them. Do an internet search for fan fiction. Reading fan fiction can be thrilling because it opens up a whole new life for your favorite character beyond the original cannon and can make their death less of a harsh blow.


Most fan fiction comes in categories. For instance, there’s romantic fan fiction that “ships” certain character together.
There’s also “crossover” fan fiction that blends different stories or series together. Pick whatever fan fiction you feel like exploring. , Fan art is another powerful way to connect with your character. Especially for book characters, fan art can give your character another dimension. Drawing is a way of spending time with your character, and it can make their loss feel less upsetting.


Draw your character based on your favorite scene. This is a great way of injecting yourself into your favorite parts of their life.

, Writing music about a character is not nearly as common as fan fiction and art, but if you are the musical type you may want to try writing a song about your character. Song writing has long been used to eulogize, and it may make you feel better to write a tribute and express your grief in song. "

Find a similar book, show or movie.,
Explore a new genre.,
Revisit an old favorite character.",How to Get Over the Death of a Fictional Character4," You’re not betraying your favorite character by finding a different character or story to follow. It may help to find the next closest thing to your character and envelop yourself in that story. Do a Google search to find similar titles or ask friends and family for recommendations.

, If you don’t feel like sticking to the same genre, you may try going down a different path. If you move from a romance book to something like a sci-fi novel, you’re bound to find a completely different set of characters. Sometimes it can help to get out of the realm that your favorite character was in.

, Go back to the favorite books or movies of your childhood. Because you already know what happens, there is no suspense or anticipation about an unforeseen character death. Spend time with some of your favorite characters from past years as a comfort for feelings of loss.

, Cut this paper into lengthwise strips that are slightly smaller than the intended final size of the book. You don't want the pages to hang out over the cover. Use the first strip you've cut as a template for cutting the remaining strips.


The amount of strips you use is up to you. The more strips you use, the thicker the book; the less you use, the thinner the book.

, Fold each strip exactly the same way.

, Always slip the new piece joining over the edge of the old piece, all the way along until all pieces are joined.

, Clip together with a binder clip while drying, to ensure that they join together very firmly.

, Place the glued-together stack of pages onto the patterned or colored paper. Cut out the cover to a size both wider and higher than the stack of pages, making sure to cut enough to wrap around the whole book, plus have flaps each side when folded in.

, Wrap the new cover around the book. Ensure that it is evenly aligned all the way around the pages stack.

, Make the folds crisp and clean.

, Keep this neat all the way around and don't press too tightly just yet. Remove the cover from the pages stack and make these folds firmly on the work surface.

, Make adjustments if needed.

, Remove the pages stack again and hold it in the center of the cover you've just made. Mark the top and base edges of the spine on the inside of the cover.

, Cut a strip from the stacked pieces to the measurement you've just made.

, This forms the start of the book pages.

, Cut in stacks of three, as before.

, These now form one set each of ""signatures"" that will be attached together to form the inside the hardcover book.The amount of signatures you have is up to you; more means a thicker book, less means a thinner book.

, Ensure that they are perfectly neat along the folded side (the bound side), so that it looks orderly. This side forms the spine of the book.

, Fill in the gaps between the signatures with Mod Podge too; this helps to ensure a smooth surface and keeps the signatures tightly bound together.


Allow to fully dry before proceeding. It is a good idea to either put something heavy to weigh down the spine as it dries or hold it in a vice such as a binder clip.

, You may find you need a few more coats; keep them all lighter than the original coat. Always allow for sufficient drying time between coats.

, Measure the book cover to be slightly larger (higher and wider) than the pages you've just stacked together. Cut more rather than less, as you can always cut away any excess.

, Ensure that it is placed evenly around each side of the stack. Paint the entire cover with a thick layer of Mod Podge now, to both help it stays affixed and to begin strengthening the cover. Allow this layer to dry properly.

, Paint or attach stripes to the spine, just as for a real old hardback book. You can mark on any fine detail as wished; use real books to guide you.

However, if you can use them sparingly, they may offer some good choices. While you may want to only find completed stories, many of the best stories out there are still in progress. Be especially careful of filtering out all ""Mature"" material, as many writers include that tag ""just in case"" despite not having any content that would be objectionable to even the average older child.;

On FF.net you can make a user account and add the best stories to your favorites and then check the author of the story for more fanfics.

, Go to other sources, such as LiveJournal or fanfic lists for a specific fandom and see what wonders await you there. Authors also sometimes have personal websites where they post stories, which goes back to paying attention to author names.

, Just because an author does not use your preferred pairing or subscribe your particular pet theory about a show doesn't mean their story can't be enjoyable. While you may not personally like OC's or some pairing, don't immediately write the story off just because it includes that in the summary. Read a chapter or two and see if the writer's style is engaging.

, A good shortcut to know if a story is worth the time to read it is by looking at the summary. If it has misspellings, all lowercase, or phrases like ""I suck at summaries, just read it"" you should simply skip over it. While it's possible you might miss a good story that way, you will certainly avoid wasting a lot of time wading through poorly written stories. Likewise, if you start and fic and you find that the first chapter is riddled with mistakes, drop the story before you invest a lot of time in something that won't be satisfying.

, Communities (CCs) hand pick stories with specific qualities to them that there are no filters for. Look for communities with large numbers of members but not too many recommendations.

, Look for people with fewer stories on their favorites list and that include stories that you have already read and liked.

Talk to friends and colleagues.,
Create a listing online.,
Interview several designers.,
Draft a written contract.,
Get the designer to sign your contract.,
Register the copyright.",How to Gain Ownership of Your Self Published Book Cover1," You may know someone who is a skilled artist or graphic designer and is willing to work with you to design an exclusive cover for you as a work made for hire. If the art on your cover is work-for-hire, you own the copyright to it.Even if you don't personally know any graphic designers, someone you know may have a designer they can recommend.
Personal recommendations often are stronger than finding someone on your own. When you have a connection with the designer, they typically have a personal interest in doing good work for you.
Working with someone you know also may get you a reduction in price relative to hiring a professional, but don't take advantage of this.
Even if your designer is a close friend or relative, show that you respect them and their profession by paying them a fair rate for their work. If they intend to offer you a discount, let them offer it – don't ask for one or assume you'll get one.;
, Even if you're not lucky enough to know someone who's willing to create your cover for you, there are many websites that allow you to list your job and find a suitable designer.Keep in mind that you're not likely to get an experienced, top-notch designer this way. The work of skilled designers typically is in high demand, and they aren't going to be looking for work on online job boards.
However, you could easily find a beginner or student who has the skills and talent to design a beautiful cover for you at a fraction of the price an experienced professional would charge.
Before you place your listing, do a little research on the acceptable going rate for projects such as yours. Don't insult designers by offering less than their work is worth – even if they're just starting out.
You also should avoid trying to find someone to create a cover for you for free. If you're willing to hire them to design your cover, be willing to compensate them for their time and effort.

, You want your book to look great, so even if you're feeling rushed for time, this isn't a situation where you want to just hire the first designer who expresses interest in your project. Take your time to talk to several designers and review their portfolios.Not only do you want to make sure they have the skills to pull off what you want, you also want to make sure their artistic vision and design aesthetic matches your needs. Someone whose portfolio is full of dark, gothic, black-and-white images probably won't have the right aesthetic to create a sunny cover design for your happy coming-of-age novel.
You also need a good understanding of the time it will take them to complete the project and the sorts of deadlines and time constraints they're comfortable with.
When you talk to designers, have a few basic ideas in mind so you can brainstorm possibilities and they can give you a reliable estimate of how long the project will take them.

, To create a valid work-for-hire, you must have an explicit written agreement that sets forth the terms of the project and establishes that you've commissioned the work for your use only and will own the rights to it after its completion.You may be able to find samples or agreement templates online that you can use as guides – but read them carefully and make sure the language you're using will achieve your goals and meet your needs.
The contract should include specific deadlines for completion and the types of files the designer will deliver to you.
Check with the company you're using to self publish your book to get the appropriate page dimensions, file sizes, and other specifications the designer will need. These figures also should be included in your contract.
Create a clause related to ownership and identify the book cover explicitly as a work for hire. State that the artist or designer is creating the work for you and he or she has no ownership right in the finished product.

, Since copyright protection begins from the moment something is created, have your designer sign the work-for-hire agreement before they begin working on your cover design.Make sure the designer understands that the work they're creating for you is a work-for-hire and they'll have no copyright ownership interest in it.
If you've agreed to let the designer include the design in their portfolio or to provide attribution to the artist of the work, this should be spelled out in the contract. However, neither of these things affect the copyright ownership in the work.
Ideally, both you and the designer should sign the same contract. If this isn't feasible – for example, because you hired someone online and they live far away – consider using an electronic document signing service to transmit and digitally sign the contract online.
Both you and the designer should have a copy of the signed contract before work begins on your book cover.

, Since your book cover is a work-for-hire, you own the copyright in it, which means you must register that copyright. This is a separate copyright from any copyright you registered in the test of the book itself.The copyright in a work for hire lasts 95 years from publication or 120 years from creation, whichever is shorter. This term differs from the copyright in your book, which will last for your life plus 70 years.
The easiest way to register your copyright is to use the U.S. Copyright Office's online registration service on its website. This service allows you to submit electronic copies of the work for deposit, pay lower registration fees relative to mailing in a paper application, and check the status of your application at any time.
Keep in mind that registration isn't strictly necessary to own the copyright, although it does provide benefits such as the right to sue for infringement in federal court.

Evaluate stock photo services.,
Read the available license agreements carefully.,
Choose a rights-managed license.,
Quantify your use.",How to Gain Ownership of Your Self Published Book Cover2," There are numerous professional stock photo companies online that allow you to peruse their catalogues and purchase rights to stock photos created by professional photographers.The first thing you need to look at is how to purchase images from the company. Some stock photo companies allow you to purchase a license for a single image, while others require you to become a member or buy a package that includes the potential usage of multiple images.
If you decide you want to use a stock photo for your self-published book cover, check the usage restrictions on each stock photo service to make sure the service allows use of photos for self-published books.
Some companies restrict usage based on the genre of book you've written. Specifically, some stock photo services don't allow their images to be used for erotic novels.
Check out some of the photos available and find several that might meet your needs. Exclusive rights may not be an option for some of them.

, Stock photo services typically offer several different levels of licensing agreements so you can find one that meets your needs and your budget. You may be able to find something that falls short of complete ownership but still accomplishes your goals.Keep in mind that different levels of exclusivity also vary in price. Even though you want ownership of your cover, an exclusive license may not be in your budget – meaning you'd have to settle for less than complete ownership or pursue another method of getting a design for your cover.
Royalty free images are among the most common licenses granted by stock photo companies, and give you the right to unlimited use of the image. However, this license is not exclusive (meaning others also could use it), and you have no ownership rights in the image itself.
If you're looking for ownership of your self-published book cover, you probably don't want to go with a royalty-free license, even though you can get one relatively cheaply.
The photo is only part of the cover. You still have some design work to do in terms of placing the title, your name, and any other material on the front and back covers.

, While a rights-managed license doesn't give you complete ownership of your self-published book cover, it does grant you the exclusive right to use the image as long as the book is sold.With a rights-managed license, you have the exclusive right to use the image, which may be as good as ownership in terms of not having to worry about any other self-published book having the same image on its cover.
However, rights-managed licenses also tend to be expensive – maybe even prohibitively so, depending on your budget.
Keep in mind that not even large corporations buy rights-managed licenses as a general rule due to their cost.

, One of the trickiest parts of purchasing a rights-managed license for a self-published book cover is determining how long you need exclusive rights to the image. Other terms such as geographic area of use also will potentially affect the cost of the license.The license you buy typically is tailored to your specific use. In some instances, this may mean that your rights are only exclusive in regard to book covers – meaning no one else can use the image for their book cover – but the image remains free for others to license and use in other fields.
If you're self publishing, you may have difficulty being able to pin down the exact territory of your use or the length of time you want your license to last.
If you're using a print-on-demand service, you'll have even more difficulty if the exclusivity of the license depends on the number of copies you've distributed. For example, if you get a rights-managed license for 100,000 copies of your book, and you sell 100,001 copies, you wouldn't have the right to use the image on that last copy.
However, if you only intend to sell a particular number of copies of your book, or sell it only for a limited period of time, these issues may not be a problem.

Research the basic principles of graphic design.,
License the appropriate software.,
Search for templates.,
Register your copyright.",How to Gain Ownership of Your Self Published Book Cover3," You don't want or need to get too deep into the weeds, but you should have an understanding of core design rules before you take the leap into designing your own cover.You might want to look at lists of good and bad book covers to get an understanding of what the good ones do right and what the bad ones do wrong.
This can give you a good idea of basic design principles like balance and contrast without having to do too much studying.
You also may be able to find design tutorials and videos online that will demonstrate some good design ideas you can incorporate into your cover.

, Typically doing graphic design requires having some sort of graphic design application on your computer, as well as a basic understanding of how to use it. Many software manufacturers offer short term licenses for their products.Most software companies offer basic tutorials online that will teach you how to use the program for free. You also may be able to take a class offered by your local public library.
Many graphic design applications are now licensed under a ""software as a service"" type arrangement. This may benefit you as they'll save your work to the cloud. Some of these applications also offer access to premium design elements and stock images.
Check your licensing agreement carefully, as well as the terms and conditions of the software's use. Make sure you have the right to use the software for commercial purposes.

, You typically can find templates online that can make it easier for you to arrange and place elements on your design page. Be careful to make sure any fonts or design elements you use are licensed for commercial use.These issues also arise if you use an online service to design your cover for you. Some of these services only provide limited rights to various elements of their designs.
If you decide to use a template or online service, read the terms and conditions carefully so you understand what aspects of your book cover you own.
Keep in mind that if you use an online service to create your book cover, the cover itself often is owned by the service you used, not you – even if you logged onto the service and created it.
Often if you use an online service you must purchase an additional license to exploit your creation commercially.

, If you create your own book cover (other than by using a ""cover creator"" service), you have a separate copyright in that design, and it must be registered separately from the copyright for the book itself. You will have to provide deposit copies of the cover design and pay registration fees.Go to the U.S. Copyright Office's website to register online and save on postage as well as registration fees.
On your application, the date you use should be the date you created your cover, not the date your self-published book is being released to the public.
Once your registration is complete, your copyright will last for your life plus 70 years.

List possible genres for the work.,
Look up similar books online.,
Track these genres on Amazon.,
Compare genre advertising fees.,
Ask for input.,
Consider the target audience.,
Choose two or three genres if reasonable.",How to Determine the Genre of a Book1," Assuming the book is already complete, you can narrow it down to a subset of possible genres. List anything that could plausibly describe a part of the book, even if you think that ""romance"" or ""action"" are relatively minor components.


If you're not trying to market a book, or you need help with genre definitions, skip down to the next section.;
, If you don't feel confident about your list of possible genres, look up works you've read that are similar to the book you're marketing. If several of them are listed under the same genre, chances are your book will fit under that category as well.


Conversely, if none of the books under ""mystery"" sound remotely similar to your book, it's probably a bad fit.

, Most fiction is sold through Amazon, so its top seller lists provide important information. Although publishers conduct more complex analysis, anyone can conduct one test quickly:


For each genre, compare the top seller lists each week for several weeks.
If the same books stay in the top 10 for a long time, the genre is slow moving. This usually means there's less competition, but you'll be fighting for a smaller readership.
If the list changes rapidly, that genre is fast moving. It will take more effort to compete, but the rewards (potential sales) are higher.

, A roundabout but effective way to compare genre success is through advertising fees. Web pages such as BookBub advertising prices and Kindle Nation sponsorship tell you how much various sites value different genres. Genres with higher costs tend to have more competition, but larger readership for those who rise above the rest.


BookBub's stats in particular give you excellent information if you plan to pay for advertising. Compare the cost of a featured deal and the effect of the deal (additional downloads/sales) to see which genre gives the best bang for your buck.

, You have some more information now, and may be able to narrow it down to a smaller list. Ask an editor, publisher, agent, or close friend for their input on the decision.

, Different genres have audiences with different demographics. Most readers will assume a romance novel is written for adults, while fantasy novels are more attractive to young adults. When you're deciding between genres, choose one with a main audience you think will enjoy the book.


If your target audience is not the same as a typical book in your genre's, clarify with an additional description. For example, write ""Young Adult Mystery"" or ""Literary Science Fiction.""

, Most websites allow you to pick more than one genre to describe a book. It's often best to allow your book to compete in multiple genres or subgenres, such as ""Science Fiction Horror"" or ""War Thriller.""

Learn the main realist fiction genres.,
Categorize speculative fiction.,
Shelve nonfiction by subject.,
Understand age descriptions.",How to Determine the Genre of a Book2," Genre is probably most important for fiction, as many readers use it to discover works they may enjoy. We'll start with realist fiction genres, or stories that are imaginary but theoretically possible:



Crime has many overlapping subcategories, including mystery, suspense, and the action-oriented thrillers.

Romance focuses primarily on a love story, and may or may not be erotic as well. This can stand alone or be combined with other genres, usually historical or paranormal fiction.

Historical fiction can be set at any point in the past. Large libraries categorize it further by specific times and places. The Western is a popular subgenre with its own tropes.

Action or adventure describe fast-paced tales of danger and exploration. It often includes elements from non-realistic fiction, but this isn't fundamental to the genre.

, These stories could not happen in the real world in the present or past. The exact sub-categories are difficult to define, as there is a huge amount of overlap and experimentation. Here's how they're most commonly arranged, but don't be surprised if one book could fit into two or three of the following:



Science fiction tends to focus more on ideas than plot. It's often set in the future or in space, and attributes unusual phenomena to science (which may or may not be plausible).

Fantasy includes magical or supernatural elements beyond the understanding of science. It tends to be plot-driven.

Horror seeks to terrify the reader. While usually grouped in speculative fiction, there are examples of realist horror as well.

, Any book that covers a topic in the real world is nonfiction, from chemistry textbooks to a collection of political speeches. You can refer to them just by describing the specific topic, or shelve them in a library with the Dewey Decimal System.


One popular nonfiction genre is the biography, which describes a historical figure's life. If written by the subject, call it an autobiography.

, Many libraries and bookstores have ""young adult"" or ""children"" sections with no other labels. This isn't technically a genre, but it tells you the subject matter and writing is appealing and appropriate for that age group.



Coming of age novels describe the transition from childhood to adulthood. They're often aimed at young adults, but not always.

Determine your budget.,
Determine how much space you have.,
Decide what condition is acceptable for your collection.,
Narrow your collection focus.",How to Collect Old Rare Books1," Many a bibliophile would love nothing more than to have an entire library’s worth of old, rare books. Unfortunately, such books are often costly. Before jumping into the world of old, rare book collecting, develop a realistic understanding of your budget and how much you can spend on your new hobby.The amount of money you spend on old, rare books depends on your income. The more spending money you have, the more you will be able to spend on old, rare books.;
, Another restriction on the size of your collection is space. An old, rare book collection can quickly consume all your shelf space. Limit your old, rare book collection only to books that you can adequately store and care for. Sell books that no longer interest you or fit within the scope of your collection., Some collectors of old, rare books will not collect books that have been restored. Others will collect restored books only if they were produced in the postwar era. Like your collection focus, the decision to obtain a book based on its condition and/or restoration status is entirely up to you.Unrestored books are typically favored over books that have been restored., The type of old, rare book that you decide to focus on depends upon your interests and personality. For instance, you could collect books only by a single author.There is no right or wrong way to narrow your collection focus.You might also collect old, rare books on a single topic or books from a single era (for example, botany books from the 19th century).
You could narrow your collection focus by concentrating on an aesthetic element (for instance, you might decide to collect only books illustrated by Edward Gorey).

"
Get a mentor.,
Familiarize yourself with collection terminology.,
Research book prices.",How to Collect Old Rare Books2," Becoming a competent collector often requires a deep knowledge of publication histories, preservation issues, and fair pricing. Contact librarians, archivists, rare book societies, and other book experts to help you better understand how to collect old, rare books. Ask your mentor questions about a particular volume, edition, or subject area.You’ll meet with more success if you can find a mentor to help you understand these and other fine points of book collection.

, There are many terms used to describe the overall state of a book, but some of the most important include those that describe the book’s condition, edition, binding, and inscription. Consult a glossary of antique bookselling terms to better understand these ranking and description systems.Book condition is rated as very fine, fine, very good, good, and poor/fair, with ""very fine"" at the top and ""poor/fair"" at the bottom.

, There are several ways to discern the appropriate price for an old, rare book. You could consult a book price or book value guide, many of which are available through large public or university libraries. Alternately, you could consult an expert (an antiquarian or bookdealer who specializes in the sort of book you’re interested in).Only consult the most current price guides, since prices fluctuate over time.
Knowing what you can expect to pay for a particular book will ease the shock of a high price later on.
More importantly, knowing the ballpark price range of a particular book will prevent you from getting scammed by a bookseller trying to sell a book for more than it is worth.

Visit an antique bookstore.,
Search online for old, rare books.,
Visit an antique book fair.,
Visit auctions or estate sales.,
Get in touch with other book collectors.,
Check flea markets, thrift stores, and garage sales.,
Obtain the best copies possible.",How to Collect Old Rare Books3," Look through a telephone book or through online directories to locate an antique bookseller in your area. Depending on your location, such a store might be far away. However, these stores are treasure houses of old, rare books, and visiting them will give you the opportunity to discover books that could be perfect for your collection.If you’re interested in a particular volume, you might be able to call the store to find out if they have it.
Some antique bookstores might even have an online catalog of their inventory.
Regular used bookstores might also have a rare book or two on hand, so give them a shot, too.

, Find what you’re looking for by using both digital marketplaces like eBay and auction sites or online stores devoted specifically to books. Before committing to a purchase, make sure that the seller is reputable (and, preferably, associated with a professional organization like the Antiquarian Booksellers' Association of America).Visiting a store and examining old, rare books firsthand is the best way to evaluate whether a book is worth purchasing. However, if an old, rare book is too far away (in another country, for instance), buying online might be the only option.

, Rare or antique book fairs hosted by antique bookdealer associations are ripe with opportunities to obtain “new” books for your old, rare book collection. For information about such events in your area, consult the events calendar of your local or national antique book organization online., Both large and small auction houses often deal in old, rare books. Check the websites of local auction houses regularly for announcements about rare book auctions. Additionally, check your newspaper for announcements regarding estate sales in which old, rare books might be listed.Estate sales might advertise old, rare books for sale by listing their specific titles or by issuing a general announcement of the items for sale (such as “old books”).

, Dealers in rare books often produce catalogs to advertise their inventory. Obtain and consult these catalogs by requesting one from the book collector or dealer in question.You might also be able to contact other booksellers by utilizing message boards, blogs, and other online communities.
Building a relationship with a particular book collector (by becoming a regular customer) could prove beneficial. Such a dealer might keep an eye out for books of interest to you or give you the first shot at purchasing certain volumes.
Some book collectors might be willing to make a trade for one of your old, rare books.

, Shopping for old, rare books at these shops and points of sale will rarely yield anything of interest.However, if you are a seasoned collector of old, rare books -- or just extremely lucky -- you might be able to obtain a volume that matches your collection interests., Suppose you’re shopping for a particular volume and know of two extant copies. If one volume is in tatters and falling apart while the other one looks as if it was printed yesterday, you’re generally better off obtaining the edition that is in better condition."

Monitor the temperature and humidity of your storage location.,
Keep the books away from strong light.,
Protect your books from dust.,
Handle the books with care.,
Store most books on shelves.,
Store heavy books on their sides.,
Shelve your books securely, but leave a little wiggle room.",How to Collect Old Rare Books4," The ideal temperature for older books is below tween 65 and 72 degrees Fahrenheit (18 to 22 degrees Celsius).The ideal humidity level is around 35%.Conditions that are too dry can cause your old, rare books to become brittle, but excessive moisture could lead to mold or foxing (the specks, splotches, and other forms of discoloration that often afflict old books).

, Ultraviolet light fades the inks and dyes used in many books, especially in older works. Exposing a rare antique book to constant sunlight will cause considerable discoloration within a few short days., Place your old, rare books in unsealed acid-free polyethylene bags.Invest in a bookshelf with a glass door to further protect them from dust., Remove a fragile book from the bookshelf by tilting it backwards and easing it out of place from the front or top sides of the book. Do not remove the book from the top of its spine, since this is the most fragile part of any book. Ease the book open rather than forcing it, since force will likely cause stiff pages to come unbound., Even old, rare books can be stored on bookshelves and actually do well when stored this way as long as the humidity, temperature, and light conditions of the room are managed well. Keeping the books in a vertical position not only saves space but ensures that each book does not have to support the weight of any other book., The weight of large, heavy books put pressure on the spine, causing pages to slowly pull away. Avoid stacking too many of these larger, heavy books on top of one another, though, since stacking more than two or three such books puts too much pressure on the bottom book., The books should be packed securely enough to prevent them from tumbling over, but not so tightly that they are difficult to remove. Leaving a small gap between books both allows you to remove them with ease when you wish to and allows for greater air circulation between the books. This will prevent unnecessary friction or stress caused by squeezing one book against another."

Are there any books in a certain series you would like to read? If you know the series then you can search the series online and you can find the books. You can also go to the library and see if they have the series that you are looking for.


What are your interests? Insert your hobbies into your library catalog search and set it to, ""Keyword."" By doing this, you will find books that you can read that you might like.;
, Often times good books will be quietly collecting dust in your own house. Maybe you forgot about one, or someone who is living with you has a couple good books. Also by search your house, you can find books for yourself, that you can read, and it won't even cost you any money.

, You can ask your older sibling, your mom, your dad, your best friend, or even your English teacher. Friends or family with whom you have things in common can often make excellent book recommendations. Local, small bookstores often have wonderful recommendations, and when they get to know you, it's even better! You should ask people that like the same genre of books that they have read, so that you can match books that you read.

, Read the bestseller lists published in most newspapers or weekly magazines. Find out which new books are making headlines, and why.

, Being a book club member is often a way to experience new books you might never have had the motivation to read otherwise. Joining a book club or making a book club helps you know who else likes the same books as you, and you can read books that others have read and discuss them. Get people that like to read books to join your book club.

, If it does, then look on the library's search engine. You can use the search engine to find a certain book, books by a certain author, or anything as broad as just a certain genre. You can also do this at home.

, He/she will be happy to help you.

, If you see anything that looks appealing, pick it up and read the back of the book. Skim over the back of the book or the inside flap, wherever the summary is. If that holds your attention, read the first page or so. If it still holds your attention, then it's probably a good book for you. The subject might be interesting to you, but the writing style can be key to enjoying it. If it looks interesting, put it in your pile. Keep doing this until you have a few books.

, Of course, if you have many books, this can be time consuming. Reading the first chapter of a book can help you know what books and genres of books that you like, and so that you won't have a hard time looking for books again.

, If you would rather have book 1 over book 2, put book 2 back. Keep doing this. If you would rather have book 3 then book 1, put book 1 back, etc.

, Chances are great that you'll like what they recommend. Make this list where you can see it, so that you can keep adding to this list as time goes on.This way you can see what books you have already read, and what books you really want to read.

, These two sites have loads of free e-books that you can download, print, or read on your computer. If your school or library has its own e-books then you can go see them too from there.

, Grab anything vaguely interesting off the shelves, check it out, and read it! You'll be surprised at what you like.,"

Stick with it.",How to Begin an Autobiography," It's very important for a budding autobiographer to document their life regularly. Journals, videos, photographs, and mementos of the past will be extremely helpful for you as you start walking down memory lane. We often remember things incorrectly, or struggle to remember specifics, but objects can't lie. Photos will tell you the truth. Your journal will always be honest.


If you don't already, start keeping a detailed journal of your day-to-day life. The best way to give yourself a reliable record of what was going on in your world and in your head is to keep a journal every night before you go to bed.
Take lots of pictures. Imagine what it would be like to have forgotten what your best friend from school looked like, and not have a picture of them. Pictures will help jog memories later and provide a helpful record of places and events. They're essential for autobiographers.
Video can be especially moving to look back on. Seeing the way in which you've aged on camera, from youth to adulthood, or seeing an old family pet living and moving around can be a powerful experience. Take lots of video over the course of your life.;
, To start collecting notes and start working on an autobiography or memoir, it can be instructive to talk with other people. You may feel like you've got a good sense of yourself and your ""story,"" but other people may have a very different version of you than you think. Ask them for their sincere impressions by conducting one-on-one interviews and recording them, or even writing up a survey and letting others fill it out anonymously. Ask specific questions of your friends, family, and acquaintances:


What is your strongest memory of me that i cannot forget?
What is the most significant event, achievement, or moment of my life?
What's a time you remember me being difficult?
Have I been a good friend? Lover? Person?
What object or place do you most associate with me?
What would you want to say at my funeral?

, One excellent way of looking for meaning in a life and finding a motivation to start writing can be found in the past. Get in touch with distant relatives you might not have previously related with, and visit locations in your past that you might not have visited in a long time, if at all. See what's become of your childhood home. Go find the old park where you used to play, the church where you were baptized, the place your great-great-great-grandfather is buried. See it all.If you're the child of immigrants, it can be very moving for many people to visit the birthplace of your family, if you haven't already. Arrange a trip to the homeland of your ancestors and see if you identify with the place in a way you hadn't before.
Try to get a sense not only of the story of your life, but the story of your family's life. Where did they come from? Who were they? Are you the child of cattle ranchers and steel workers, or the child of bankers and lawyers? On what side did your ancestors fight in an important war? Has anyone in your family been to prison? Are you the descendant of knights? Royalty? The answers to these questions can make for powerful discoveries.

, Don't just look through your own documents and memorabilia, look through the leavings of your ancestors. Read their letters back and forth, written during wartime. Read their journals and diaries, making copies of everything to archive the objects safely, especially if you're dealing with delicate documents that are very old.


At the very least, it's a great idea to look through old photographs. Nothing can jog stronger emotions and powerful nostalgia quicker than seeing your grandparents wedding day, or seeing your parents as children. Spend time with old photographs.
Every family needs a reliable archivist, someone who takes charge of looking over the family's documents. If you've got an interest in digging around in the past, start taking on this responsibility. Learn everything you can about your family, your history, and yourself.

, Lots of nonfiction books are planned beforehand, plotting an exciting change in your life, travel, or project to document with a book. It can be a great way to generate material. If you're worried that not much exciting has happened to you in your life, consider making a big change and writing a proposal to get it funded.


Try being a fish out of water. If you're a city-dweller, see what would happen if you moved to the country for a year and decided to eat only food that you could grow. Spend a year researching farming methods and homesteading skills, propose the project, and strap on your gardening gloves. You could also travel to a turbulent location, getting a gig teaching overseas, somewhere exciting and unfamiliar to you. Write about your experience being there.
Try to give something up for a long period of time, like throwing away your garbage, or eating processed sugar, and document your experience of this experiment.
If you have an exciting enough proposal, lots of publishers will advance you some money and a contract if you've got a good track record of publishing, or if you've gotten a really great idea for a non-fiction project.

, Before you get started on your own, see how other writers have approached the task of recording their lives in print. Some of the best writing comes from writers taking on the challenge of their own lives. Some classic autobiographies and memoirs include:



Townie by Andre Dubus III

I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings by Maya Angelou

The Autobiography of Malcolm X by Malcolm X and Alex Haley

Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood by Marjane Satrapi

A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius by Dave Eggers
Life"" by Keith Richards

Me by Katherine Hepburn

Another Bullshit Night in Suck City by Nick Flynn

, The hardest thing about writing an autobiography or memoir is in finding the core of your story. At the worst, an autobiography can be a rambling series of boring details, flying by whole months and years without any interesting or specific details to hold up the story for itself. Or, an autobiography can elevate mundane details to feel important, profound, and grave. It's all got to do with finding the emotional core of your story and keeping it at the forefront of your story. What is your story? What is the most significant part of your life that needs to be told?


Picture your whole life, as you've lived it, like a beautiful mountain range off in the distance. If you want to give people a tour of your mountains, you could rent a helicopter and fly over it in 20 minutes, pointing to little things in the distance. Or you could take them on a hiking trip through the mountains, showing them the nitty-gritty, the up-close, and the personal. That's what people will want to read.

, If you're struggling to find the relatable part of your life, start thinking of big changes in your life. What's the difference between the way you used to be and the way you are now? How have you grown up? What obstacles or struggles have you overcome?


Quick exercise: Write up a short one-page portrait of yourself 5 years ago, 30 years ago, or even a couple of months ago, if necessary–however long you need to account for a significant change in yourself. What would you have been wearing? What would have been your major goal in life? What would you have been doing on an average Saturday night?
In Dubus' Townie, the author recounts what it was like growing up in a college town, where his estranged father worked as a successful and famous novelist and professor. He, though, lived with his mother, doing drugs, getting into fights, and struggling with his identity. His transformation from being an out-of-control, anger-obsessed ""townie"" to a successful writer (like his father) forms the core of the story.

, Every good story needs a strong supporting cast of other characters to round out the narrative. Although it's your life that will form the main structure and focus of the autobiography, nobody wants to read a self-absorbed rant. Who are the most important other characters in your story?


Quick exercise: Write up a one-page character sketch of each member of your family, focusing on questions you've asked of yourself, or asked others about yourself for research. What is your brother's most crowning achievement? Is your mother a happy person? Is your father a good friend? If your friends are more significant in your autobiography than your family, focus more on them.
It's important to keep your list of main characters as small as possible, and ""blend"" characters, if necessary. While all the boys you used to hang out with at the bar, or all the people you used to work with may be important at some point in the story, throwing 10 new names at us every two pages will quickly overwhelm your reader. It's a common writer's technique to blend them into a single character to avoid burdening the reader with too many different names. Pick one main character per important setting.

, What will the setting of your autobiography be? Where do the most important dramatic shifts, or events, or changes take place? In what way has that placed shaped you and your story? Think both in terms of the geography and in terms of the specifics–your country and your state might be just as important as your street, or your neighborhood.


Quick exercise: Write down everything you associate with your hometown, or the region you're from. Do you identify as a Midwesterner, if you're from Iowa, or do you identify as an Iowan? When people ask you about where you're from, are you embarrassed to describe it? Proud?
If you've moved around a lot, consider focusing on the most distinctive, memorable, or critical-to-the-story locations. Mikal Gilmore's Shot in the Heart, which chronicles a life on the move and his tumultuous relationship with his brother, the convicted murderer Gary Gilmore, involves dozens of moves and living spaces, but will often summarize them, rather than dramatizing them.

, The difference between a successful and unsuccessful autobiography is whether or not you'll be able to limit the scope into a single, unifying idea, or whether the amount of different details will overwhelm the story. No one can include their entire life in a story. Some things will have to be left out. Deciding what those things will be can be just as important as deciding what will go in.


An autobiography is a record of the entire life of the writer, while a memoir is a document that covers a very specific story, period of time, or aspect of the writer's life. Memoirs are more versatile, especially if you're young. An autobiography written at the age of 18 might be somewhat tedious, but a memoir could be great.If you want to write an autobiography, you need to pick a unifying theme to carry through the story. Maybe your relationship with your father is the most important part of your story, or your military experience, or your struggle with addictions, or your rock-solid faith and the difficulty in holding onto it.

, When you start getting some sense of what you think your autobiography or memoir might include and where you might go with it, it's helpful for many writers to write up a rough outline of where the story will go. Unlike in fiction, where you've got to invent the plot, you already will have some sense of where your story might end, or what will come next. Outlining can be a helpful way of looking at the major plot points all at once and deciding what to emphasize and what to summarize.Chronological autobiographies work from birth to adulthood, following closely to the order of events as they occurred in your life, while thematic and anecdotal autobiographies will jump around, telling stories based around particular themes. Some writers prefer to let whim drive the car, and not a complicated outlined plan for the plot.
Johnny Cash's autobiography Cash wanders around his story, starting at his home in Jamaica, then going back in time, constantly shifting around like a good late-night conversation on the front porch with an old timer. It's a wonderful and familiar way of structuring an autobiography, impossible to outline.

, The biggest secret that successful writers, novelists, and memoirists have about the process? There is no secret. You just sit down and start working. Every day, Try to write some more of your autobiography. Get some more out on the page. Treat it like you're mining raw material out of the earth. Get everything out, as much as possible. Worry about whether or not it's good later. Try to surprise yourself before your work is done.


Ron Carlson, a novelist and story writer, calls this commitment ""staying in the room."" While you might want to get up and grab a cup of coffee, or fiddle with your record player, or take the dog for a walk, the writer stays in the room and sticks with the difficult part of the story. That's where the writing happens. Stay in the room and write.

, Many a writing project has faltered due to lack of production. It's hard to sit down at the desk every day and actually get some words on the page, but it can be a lot easier for some people to write up a schedule and try to stick to it. Decide how much you'd like to produce on a daily basis and Try to meet that level every day. 200 words? 1200 words? 20 pages? It's up to you and your work habits.


You might also decide on a set amount of time you can commit to the project every day and not worry about a number of words or pages. If you've got a solid 45 minutes of quiet after you get home from work, or before you go to bed at night, set aside that time to work on your autobiography undisturbed. Stay focused and do as much as you can.

, If you want to write an autobiography but aren't thrilled about the idea of actually writing, or if you struggle with things like vocabulary and grammar, it might be more appropriate to record yourself ""talking"" your story, and transcribe it later. Get yourself a good drink, a quiet room, and a digital recorder and hit the green button. Let the stories flow.


It might be helpful to have someone to talk to, treating the recording process more like an interview. It can be weird to just talk into a microphone by yourself, but if you're a great raconteur with lots of hilarious stories to tell, it might put you in your own element to have a close friend or relative to talk with and lob questions at you.
Most rockstar autobiographies, or memoirs written by people who aren't professional writers, are ""written"" this way. They'll record interviews, telling stories and anecdotes from their lives, and then put it together with a ghostwriter who oversees the actual writing of the book. It may seem like cheating, but it works.

, Memories are unreliable. Most real-life stories don't fit together with the simplicity and the elegance of fiction, but writers have a tendency to let narrative guidelines and rules affect memories, polishing them and fitting them into the story. Don't worry so much about whether or not the story you're telling is 100% accurate, worry about whether or not it rings true in the emotional sense of the story.


Sometimes, you might remember two important conversations with your friend Craig, both times over pizza at your favorite place. Maybe they happened on two separate nights two years apart, but for the purposes of the story it'd be a lot easier to make it all one conversation. Is there any harm in doing so, if it tidies up the narrative? Probably not.
There's a difference between cleaning up the messy details in your memory and straight-up making stuff up. Don't invent people, places, or problems. No outright lies.

, Every writer has an internal critic perched on their shoulder. That critic complains, finds everything too cliché, shouting insults into the writers ear. Tell that critic to can it. When you're first getting started, it's important to uncensor yourself as much as possible. Just write. Don't worry about whether or not what you're writing is perfect, whether each sentence is immaculate, whether or not people are going to be interested. Just write. Do the important work of cleaning it up in revision.


At the end of each writing period, look back at what you've written and then make changes, or better yet let your writing sit on the shelf for a while before you do anything to make changes.

, If you're going along and writing your story, you might eventually get stuck and find yourself at a loss for where to go next. Time to get creative. Use all your research and the documents you've collected to wrestle something out of yourself onto the page. Treat it like a collage, or an art project, more than a ""book.""


Dig out a picture of your family from the era yore writing about and write about what you imagine each character was thinking at the moment the picture was taken? Write it.
Let someone else talk for a while. If you've done some interviews with family members, write in one of their voices for a while. Transcribe an interview you conducted and get their input on the page.
Imagine the life of an important object. Make your grandfather's brass knuckles he brought back from WWII be the point-of-view character for an argument between he and your father. Sit with your father's coin collection and imagine his collecting them, his feeling them, his looking through them. What did he see?

, When you're writing narrative prose, it's important to learn to distinguish between writing scenes and writing summaries. Good writing is paced according to its ability to summarize periods of time in narration and at a distance, and to slow down certain important moments and display them in scenes. Think of summary like montage in a movie, and scenes like particular exchanges of dialog.


Example of summary: ""We moved around a lot that summer. It was all scraped knees and gas station hot dogs, the hot leather in the back of dad's '88 Suburban. We fished at Raccoon Lake, got leeches at Diamond Lake, and visited grandma in Kankakee. She gave us kids a jar of pickles to split while dad got drunk in the backyard, fell asleep, and ended up with the god of all sunburns lobstering across his back.""
Example of scene: ""We heard the dog whine and Grandma opened the screen door a crack to look out at him, but we could see she held her foot against the bottom of it, like she was scared of something she saw. Her hands were still covered in globs of pie dough and her face was like a mask. She said, 'Bill Jr. you touch that dog again and I'm calling the police.' We stopped eating pickles. The pickles seemed ridiculous, suddenly. We waited to hear what she would say next.""

, Good writing is made of luminous particulars and specific details. Bad writing is made of abstractions. The more specific and detail-oriented you can make your writing, the better off your autobiography will be. Try to make each important scene as long as possible, get everything out of it that you possibly can. If it ends up being too much, you can always cut it back later.


If the emotional core of your story revolves around your relationship with your father, you could give us 50 pages of a systematic takedown of his worldview, railing against his small-mindedness, or misogyny, or tyrannical ranting, but you might lose a lot of us three pages in. Instead, focus on things that we can see. Describe his after-work routine. Describe the way he said things to your mother. Describe the way he ate his steak. Give us particular details.

, Most inexperienced writers over-use dialog, writing whole pages of exchanges between characters. Writing dialog is very difficult, especially in an autobiographical project. Only use dialog when characters absolutely need to speak, and summarize all other spoken language. Aim for no more than one exchange of dialog for every 200 words of summary and narration.


When you're writing a scene, the dialog should be used to move the scene forward, and should also be used to show us something about how the character is experiencing the scene. Maybe it's important for the grandmother character that she be the one to stand up to Jay Jr. and tell him to stop. Maybe that's a big important change in the drama.

, There are no ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" in real life, and they shouldn't show up in good writing. Memory has a tendency to colonize our opinions, and it can be easy to erase the good qualities of an ex-girlfriend, or only remember the good parts of college friends. Try to paint an even-handed portrait though, and your writing will be better off for it.


There should be no straight-up evil characters that show up in autobiography, they need to have motivations and attributes all their own. If Bill Jr. is a drunken dog-beater, there needs to be a good reason why, not just because he's Satan reincarnate.
Let ""good"" characters have moments of embarrassment, or failures of character. Show them in failure so we can see them in success and appreciate them more for it.

, Keep to your production schedule as much as possible. There'll probably be days that you won't feel like writing much, but try to keep going. Find the next scene, the next chapter, the next story. Jump around if you need to, or go back to the research well to jog something else loose.


If you have to put your writing aside for a while, so be it. You can always live a little more, gain some more perspective, and return to the book with fresh eyes. An autobiography can be an ever-changing thing. Keep living your life and writing new chapters.

Decide on the topic you want to write about.,
Come up with characters for your story.,
Show, don't tell.,
Make sure you are able to set the story in a setting.,
Lay out your plot in an organized way.,
Keep writing.",How to Be Able to Create a Story1," Your work can be about whatever you want it to be. You could try a traditional genre, or you could make up your own, unique genre.;
, You'll want a main character or characters, people with whom they are friends and with whom they are enemies. If there is a main antagonist (often considered a bad guy) come with them too.


Authors find that actually planning the entire story, though it may take months, is beneficial to creating a smooth, connected story. Developing your characters is important, and conveying them correctly in your work is even more so.

, When writing, don't tell your readers everything you planned abruptly (although the occasional telling is fine). Instead, show them. The readers can figure out your characters' personalities better when they observe the characters' to reactions to different situations.


For example: your main character, Mary, is very smart (according to your planning). Don't write, ""Mary was a very smart woman;"" write, ""Mary always stayed in the library for hours, picking through reference book after reference book, unable to decide what she was going to study today."" The latter lets the reader pick up on the fact that Mary is smart without you force feeding it to them.

, Try to come up with a setting that the reader can find believable, and one that makes sense, even if it's a fantastical setting, it should have elements that ground it in reality. Try to make it sound like a place that someone would want to read about. Make up your own town or state if you want.


For example: Harry Potter has a very fantastical setting, but the idea of school, politics, and the importance of friends and family are very real and very universal and make the fantastical elements feel more realistic.

, Use an outline or some other form of organization to keep your plot straight. Then, when you write, all you have to do is look at the outline.

, Unless you plan on changing your story completely, don't touch what you've already written. Once your story comes to a close, then you start at the beginning and work your way through the book, changing little segments, adding characters' back stories, etc.

People watch.,

Scour the phone book.,
Read nonfiction.",How to Be Able to Create a Story2," Spend time in public places, surreptitiously watching people and making up stories for them. Write down descriptions of their appearance, their mannerisms, their voices, what they were saying and what they were doing. Then take those stories and make them longer and more intricate.


Put people that you see into the same story, even if they aren't interacting in real life.

, Obviously be safe while doing this, but talk to random people. Get insights into their lives and what they're doing. Even a simple discussion about the weather can give you insight into a person.


Do they mumble? Do they meet your eye or do they look anywhere but you? How is their body language?






Using what you've observed, write a story about them, using the mannerisms and descriptions that you've noticed about them.

, You will find the most amazing and bizarre names in the phone book. Look through it and pick out the best ones. Write stories with characters based on the names that you've discovered.

, The best stories do seem to come from real life events and experiences (as they say ""Truth is stranger than fiction"") so read lots of nonfiction, especially if you're a fiction writer. Read histories of all different countries and time periods and build stories based on the things that happen. Read science books and medical books. Read about seafarers, and potential witches.


Pick out the facts and things that most interest you and build stories based on them. For instance, you could take something as simple as a decommissioned lighthouse in Maine and turn it into an epic tale of good and evil.

, Many local libraries hold occasional book sales to clear out ""deacquisitioned"" books they've decided to remove from the shelf. These books are usually sold cheap (US $1–$5), and are usually kept in very good condition compared to other used books.

, Depending on the store and region, second hand stores and pawn shops may sell a wide variety of books under $10. Always flick through the books to check for damage first, as condition varies greatly.

, Also called opportunity shops or ""op shops,"" the selection and quality is similar to second hand stores. The books tend to be slightly more expensive, and prices are less negotiable, since the goal is charity fundraising.


Some hospital gift shops have a similar section to benefit the hospital.

, Books sold here tend to be in the best condition, but are more expensive than other options. Your best bet is stores that sell publisher overstock and other bargain books, although these tend to flood with non-fiction rather than bestsellers. Check the store's website for upcoming sales and discounts.


Antiquarian bookstores are great for finding unexpected treasures and books on old-fashioned topics, often for low prices. And what bookworm doesn't enjoy wandering around a hoard of books older than he is?

, You can find great deals here, depending on the store. However, 99% of the books sold here are unsorted. If you don't mind hours of searching through boxes, keep an eye out for these sales.

, ""Take a book, leave a book"" boxes have been cropping up in many regions the last few years. If you don't see any in your neighborhood, consider setting one up in front of your home. In good weather, this is as simple as putting out an old bookcase stocked with old books, and a paper sign with instructions. This can be a great way to meet neighbors and start a little community as well.


If you don't have a yard, ask your landlord if you can put a bookcase in the lobby. Public or semi-public places such as libraries, college campuses, or churches are another possible opportunity. If possible, have the hosting organization advertise it on its website.
For more information, look up the Little Free Library project.

, If you know other people who share your reading tastes, don't waste money buying multiple copies of the same books. Lend each other reading material instead, and/or agree to split the price of new purchases between you.

, You can arrange this event at a community center, school, or even just among a large group of friends. Each person drops off books they no longer want, and receives an equal number of tickets. You can then browse the books and talk to other attendees, then trade in each ticket for any one book.


There are also online book swap sites such as BookMooch.

, Thrift Books, Amazon's AbeBooks, and similar sites offer many used books, often for less than US $2. The cheapest ones are often dog-eared, frayed, or heavily marked, but they are rarely unreadable.


Keep in mind that it's difficult to judge a book based on the cover image. Don't spend too much money on an unknown book unless you're confident in the site's return policy.

, Unless you can find a specific book market, these locations usually have relatively few books. Keep an eye out if you're also looking for other cheap goods, but don't expect great results.


The main advantage to these locales is the negotiable prices. Most sellers expect to haggle.

, Although it takes some initial investment, an e-reader can be cost-effective in the long run. Some e-readers offer a subscription service, where you pay a certain amount each month to gain access to hundreds of titles. If you're an eBook fan, this could rapidly make up for the initial cost.


You can often find used e-readers for under $30 online.
Paying for an Amazon Prime account may get you access to one free eBook each month.

Link the tone to theme, mood, plot and style.",How to Analyze Tone in Literature," One of the most common tones in literature is a solemn or gloomy tone, where the tone feels heavy or serious. Often the tone comes across as bleak or dark if it is solemn. You may respond to a solemn literary work by feeling sad or unsettled.A good example of a solemn or gloomy tone is in the short story “The School” by Donald Barthelme.;
, Another common tone in literature is a suspenseful tone, often found in thriller novels or mystery stories. A suspenseful tone creates a sense of dread and anticipation in the reader. Often, you may feel on the edge of your seat or full of anxiety as you read a literary work with a suspenseful tone.A good example of a suspenseful tone is in the short story “The Lottery” by Shirley Jackson., A work of literature with a humorous tone will often make the reader laugh or smile. A humorous tone is often found in works of comedy and satire. It can come across as playful, witty, or ironic. Sometimes writers use a humorous tone to counter a solemn tone in the same work, such as in a novel or a short story.A good example of a humorous tone is the poem “Snowball” by Shel Silverstein.

, A sarcastic tone is often used to invoke laughter or amusement in the reader. It may come across as biting and critical. You can find a sarcastic tone in novels and short stories, particularly if they are told in the first person with a narrator who has a sarcastic or dry sense of humor.A good example of a sarcastic tone is in the novel The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger.

, It can be tricky to distinguish between mood and tone in literature, especially because they are often connected or interrelated. Mood is different from tone in that it describes the setting and atmosphere of a text. Mood is created through the reader’s response to the tone in a work. However, both mood and tone are shaped by the writer’s ability to convey emotion in the reader.For example, if a story is set in an abandoned cabin the woods, it may have a creepy or unsettling mood. The author may then have a narrator or main character who uses a gloomy or depressing tone to describe the cabin in the woods to the reader.

, One way you can determine tone in a literary work is to pay attention to the words and language used by the author. Consider why the author chose certain words or language to describe a scene. Think about why certain words were used to discuss a character. Think about how these choices create tone.For example, you may study a passage from the short story “The School:"" “And the trees all died...I don’t know why they died, they just died. Something wrong with the soil possibly or maybe the stuff we got from the nursery wasn’t the best...All these kids looking at these little brown sticks, it was depressing.”
In the passage, Barthelme creates a solemn, gloomy tone by using words like “depressing,” “dead,” “died,” and “wrong.”

, Read a few lines of the literary work and notice how the sentences are structured. You may notice the sentences are short and often do not vary in length, creating a certain tone. Or you may notice sentences that are long and winding down the page. This could create a meditative or thoughtful tone.For example, in many thriller novels, the sentences are often short and to the point, with very few adjectives or adverbs. This can help to create a suspenseful tone, full of action and tension.

, Another way you can determine the tone of a piece is to look at the imagery used by the author to describe a setting, scene, or character. Certain imagery will create a certain tone to the piece. Strong imagery can tip you off to the tone intended by the author.For example, if a person’s face is described as “glowing with happiness and excitement,” this may create a joyful tone. Or if a cabin in the woods is described as “grimy with the fingerprints of the previous occupants,” this may create a suspenseful tone.

, Reading a work of literature out loud can help you get a better sense of the diction of the piece. Diction refers to how words sound next to one another in a sentence. It is often more clear when a work is read out loud, as you can hear how each word sounds and pay attention to how this creates a certain tone to the piece.For example, you may read the following lines from The Catcher in the Rye out loud to determine the tone: “God damn money. It always ends up making you blue as hell.” The use of “god damn” and “blue as hell” gives the line a sarcastic or bitter tone, with a hint of humor and sadness.

, It is common for an author to use more than one tone in a work of literature, especially a long work like a novel. You may notice that the tone shifts in the work from chapter to chapter, narrator to narrator, or scene to scene. The author may do this to get into the particular voice of a character or to signal a shift in the characters or the action in the piece.For example, a novel may begin with a humorous tone and shift into a more serious tone as the author delves deeper into a character’s history or personal relationships.

, To describe the tone of the literary work, use specific adjectives that illustrate which tone the narrator is using, such as “gloomy,” “solemn,” “humorous,” or “sarcastic.” The more specific you are when describing the tone, the more insightful your analysis will be.For example, you may write, “The tone of this work is solemn and serious. The author uses word choice, language, diction, and imagery to convey this tone.”
You can use more than one adjective if this will make your description more accurate.

, After describing the tone in detail, use a few quotes from the text to back up your argument. Pick quotes that clearly illustrate tone based on word choice, language, diction, or imagery.


For example, if you are writing about The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, you may use the last line of the book as an example: “So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.”
You can then note that the imagery of a boat going against the current as well as the use of the words “beat,” “borne,” and “past” create a solemn, nostalgic tone to the ending.

, If there is more than one tone in the work, compare the different tones in your analysis. This often occurs when the literary work is long, such as a novel or an epic poem. Identify when the shifts in tone occur in the literary work. Discuss why you think the tone shifts and how it affected you as a reader.


For example, you may note, “The tone shifts in Chapter 13 from a humorous tone to a more serious tone. This occurs when the narrator discusses their mother’s illness and death.”

, Make sure your analysis of tone is always connected to other elements such as mood, plot, theme, and style. The tone of a work is often used to illustrate a larger theme or to create a distinct mood. Linking tone to these other elements can sharpen your analysis and make it that much stronger.


For example, you may link the nostalgic, solemn tone of the closing line in The Great Gatsby to the themes of remembrance, loss, and thwarted love in the novel.

Make time to read.,

Select several books according to your interests and your reasons for reading them.,
Sample each book.,
Start reading each book while your attention for it is fresh.,

Scatter books around.,
Mix books of different types and formats.,
Have a time line in mind, even if it's not a firm or strict one.,
Don't ignore any book so long that you lose the story or forget where you were.,

Read an entire chapter or section at a time whenever possible, or at least find a good stopping place.,
Let your focus and preferences guide you.,
Get through a difficult book by using a fun book as a reward.,

Take notes on key points as you go, or mark pages you will need to find again for a project.
,
Try to read endings in longer sittings and spend less time in other books.,
Finish books.",How to Read Several Books at Once," If you cannot get through even one book at a time, starting several at once is only going to make the whole process slower. Even if you can only spend a few minutes per day reading, you can still switch on and off between different books.
,

The books may be related or unrelated, depending on your purpose. If you are researching a particular subject, they will probably be related. If you are reading for fun, the books may be any assortment you wish.
Choose books that draw you in. It will be easier to come back to a book you enjoy.

, You can read the beginnings (one at a time), or you can pre-read. Look at the table of contents, and read or skim the summaries, introductions, and prefaces., Try to start the day you bring it home or the day you begin a project. Use your fresh interest to read a larger portion of a new book in the first sitting or sittings. Thoroughly engage with and commit to reading each book in turn. Reading more the first time will also give you a good head start.

You need not start several books at the same time to read them concurrently. Instead, try laddering them, getting well into the first before starting the next.

, Leave one on your nightstand, one by the breakfast table, and another in your bag. Read whichever book is nearby when you are there. Match the book to the focus or mood you usually have when you visit a certain place.

Place one in your home bathroom in easy reach of the toilet, especially if it's nonfiction with a lot of short subtopics. You'll be surprised at how often you read in the bathroom. Don't put it where the shower will get it wet though and be careful if you read during soaking baths to have a towel handy to dry your hands while handling pages. You might want a short reading stand next to a bathtub.

, Listen to an audio book in the car, keep a paperback or e-book in your purse, have e-books on your iPad, etc. Depending on your purpose, choose books of different subjects and difficulties, so that you'll have choices for different places and moods. Reading about different topics will help you keep straight which book is which.

Your mind can cope well with associating different books being read within the same time period but in different places. So, have books for the bus or train to and from work, books for bedtime, books for the hammock afternoon, and books for moments when you need instructions, such as cookbooks.
Keep in mind that reading a politically charged tome at bedtime will be more effort than a lightweight genre read. Another good reason for having several books on the go at once! Good bedtime choices include rereading old favorites - when you know how it ends, it's easier to set it down when you finally drowse.

, If no library or project due date is built into your reading choices, notice when you begin each book and pay attention to your progress. Use this awareness of time to keep yourself relatively focused., The books you read concurrently must compete for your attention. If a book interests you much less than others, change your approach. Read that book separately. Read that book alongside others of a similar interest level. Or, consider dropping the book altogether., Reading an entire section in a sitting will help you keep continuity when you skip from book to book. Reading one or two shorter sections of a book per sitting can also help you understand difficult or complex writing better., If you find yourself drawn into a book and feel like continuing for longer, go ahead. Read whichever book you are in the mood to read at a given moment., Let yourself read the fun book for awhile when you get through part of the difficult book.,, Endings in fiction are often the most intense part of the story. In nonfiction, they usually contain summaries, conclusions, and other important information. Either way, try to read with more continuity near the end., However many books you choose to read at a time, make sure to continue to read the important ones until you finish with them."

Children's picture books are great beginner choices, moving on to children's chapter books and comic books. Intermediate readers can try a young adult novel, pulp fiction, or interesting blogs and articles. Classic literature tends to use old-fashioned language and difficult grammar. It's best to save that for a later attempt.


Avoid books aimed at foreigners learning the language. These tend to be very boring.
It can help if you're already familiar with the subject matter. Classic fairy tales are a good choice for this reason, as are books you've already read in your own language.
If children's books bore you, find a book with side-by-side printings in two languages. Try only to refer to your native language text when you're truly lost.;
, If you can, do at least part of your reading together with a conversation partner, teacher, or native speaker. Even someone at a similar level of language ability can help you unpack difficult sentences and stay motivated to continue.

, Speaking and listening are important for learning a language as well. Practice these skills by reading some passages aloud. If you're reading with a conversation partner, take turns reading aloud.

, Don't rush to the dictionary every time you don't know a word. Read the rest of the paragraph and see if you can figure out the general meaning from context. Only look up a word if you can't make sense of the passage without it, or if you see the word appear many times in the story. While difficult at first, this active effort increases your understanding of the vocabulary and language.

, A pocket dictionary or electronic dictionary lets you look up words much faster than a comprehensive printed source. Just don't give in to the temptation to look up every word.

, Periodically stop and summarize what just happened. If you're not sure or it doesn't make sense, you may want to go back and try again.

, If you're serious about learning the language, keep a small notebook around as you read. Jot down vocabulary and idioms you'd like to remember, or unusual grammar you'd like to ask someone about. This helps you expand your knowledge without much interruption of your reading.


If you don't understand an idiom or informal phrase, an online search can be more helpful than a dictionary.

, Even a fun book can be difficult to read. Setting a daily goal is a great way to keep yourself on track.


One or two pages per day is a very reasonable goal for a beginner. Increase this as your skills improve.

, If a book is losing your interest, find something different. This may mean the book is too easy or too difficult to hold your attention, or just that you're not enjoying it. Move on to a different author or genre if you're not excited by the subject matter or plot.

, If you want a broad understanding of the language, read at least two types of language: formal writing and colloquial conversation. News articles are a good middle ground that can teach you contemporary speech with fairly formal grammar.

, Everyone who learns a foreign language begins by translating every sentence back to their native tongue. As your language skills improve, you'll start to bypass this and understand it without translation. Keep this in mind as you become an experienced reader, and resist the urge to think in your native language.

If you are involved in cover art, try sketching a cover for your book.",How to Come Up with a Good Book Title," Some writers get stuck on the thought that an author must come up with the perfect title before starting. However, most authors do not find this a productive mindset. Most writers will come up with a ""working title"" which is basically a rough draft edition of the title--temporary and almost guaranteed to change.


After you write the book, everything will become more clear. But be sure to write down any ideas that come to your head, even if they're ridiculous.;
, Ask someone to join a brainstorming session. Brainstorming with another person is faster, more effective, and more fun than thinking about it yourself. Ask the other person to read your book.


Meet in a quiet, relaxed location so you can both focus on your work. Put on unobtrusive music if it helps you think. Sometimes music, especially if relevant to your book, can give you inspiration. Don't be afraid to use a lyric or two as a potential title.

, Read your book and think about its identity. Think of titles related to the central message, or to the main emotion it inspires. Talk to your friend about what inspired you to write the book, and how you felt as you wrote it. These conversations will guide you to a title that fits the story and your personality.


Different people may interpret your work in different ways; let each person involved in the brainstorming session list their ideas. Share the lists of ideas with each other.
If stuck, brainstorm keywords that cover your book's main themes and story.

, Write down favorite phrases from your work. These may or may not work as book titles, but they can give raw material to play with. Some books use titles from book quotations. Like The Beginning of Everything. This book's title is inspired by a quote from F. Scott Fitzgerald. Do you have a quote that relates to your book? This just might be the best title you come up with.

, Many novels simply go with the name of the main character. Think of titles that mention the main character of the book, or a group of characters. This tends to be especially true of books driven by one main character. For example:


Jude the Obscure
Anne of Green Gables
Harry Potter
The Hobbit
Percy Jackson

, This can be a good choice if the setting is a key part of your work, or if it's an unusual setting that attracts attention. For example:


Little House on the Prairie
Through the Looking Glass
The Jungle Book
50,000 Leagues Under the Sea
Wuthering Heights

, Your title can address the book's themes or inspiration rather than the exact content. Mysterious titles intrigue readers who are looking for something poetic or unusual. For example:


The Shadow of the Wind
Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil
The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe

, The way the author works with these two elements - clarity and mystery - really depends on the type of book. For non-fiction, clarity is more important (especially for books that focus on a very specific topic). For fiction, mystery is more important.

, This is a popular approach for nonfiction books. The title should give the reader an idea of the book's topic, but it doesn't need to be an exact description. For example:


Thinking, Fast and Slow
How Not to be Wrong
Good to Great
Made to Stick

, Think of titles that relate to common life experiences, especially ones that promise solutions to the reader's problems. Books with these titles range from self-help books to literary novels. For example:

How to Get Happy
The Awkward Age
The Dangerous Book for Girls
If necessary, use a subtitle to expand and clarify any misconception. The title How to Be a Man may draw a different reader than How to Be a Man: A Memoir of the Rocky Mountains, versus How to Be a Man: The Autobiography of a Tran-person or How to be a Man: A Study of Gender, Adolescence, and Media in 1950's America.

, Browse book titles online or in bookstores and libraries.


Do not copy an existing title, but good titles spark ideas for other good titles.
Identify what appeals to you about the title, and brainstorm ideas for your book with similar characteristics.
Be original. Your book's title has to compete with many other similar novels, so have a title that will stand out from the crowd.
Titles are not protected by copyright, at least in the United States, but unique phrases may be trademarked.You are probably safe if you go with a well-known phrase, but you still risk confusion at the bookstore.

, In some cases, a unique title can be used for


For example, readers who are interested and generally proficient in mathematics may be drawn to a book with a mathematical expression. Example: 4-1=0

Try a foreign language. Books with a title in a non-English title can help give your title an international feel. Or, may tie into a character, place, idea, or event that may not be well described by the English language.
Keep your audience in mind. If you are writing for people interested and knowledgeable in astrophysics, this will likely be a very different target group than that of a Christian romance novel.

Avoid confusing titles. There is a fine line between ""mysterious"" and ""confusing"".
If your title is hard to spell, it may be difficult for potential buyers to find your book online or in bookstores.
Titles in non-English languages may be confusing. To some, it can be hard to remember, spell, or be viewed as overly scholarly. Some words, phrases, or the like may be relatively well understood by the public at large (""deja vu"", ""et cetera"", ""hasta la vista"") but be careful of the usage of these. In general, it is better to translate a title if possible.



, Use all of the techniques above, until you have 25 possible titles or even 50! If the titles are not good, they can spark more ideas and discussions.


You can combine more than one of the above techniques. For example, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets mentions both a character and a setting, and foreshadows the climax of the novel.

, Go through your list of ideas and pull out ten favorites. Follow the steps below to evaluate each title. Examine each title. If there is no clear winner, narrow it down to your favorite four or five and repeat the process.

, Review the title with your editor, publisher, or a friend whose judgment and scrutiny you can trust. Would it attract the attention of people who would enjoy your work? Does it make sense? Is it memorable? Does it relate to the contents of your book?

, How does it sound? Does it have good flow and rhythm, making it easy and pleasant to say? If the title sounds strange, or is difficult to say, clumsy or just somehow not right this is likely an indication that this is not a good title.

, Keep your title as short as possible, no longer than a few words. Long titles are difficult to remember, and rarely reach out and grab a passing reader.


If you think more detail, is necessary, attach a subtitle. For example, the cover of Wild Swans shows off the short, punchy title, and adds the informative subtitle Three Daughters of China in much smaller text.

, Authors may or may not have any involvement with cover art. But if you do, many find a little visualization helps. Sketch a simple book cover just to get an idea of the title's impression. Play with different arrangements of the title and your name. Does it pop out at you from the shelf? Is there a drawing that would work particularly well with the title?


Be careful of being overly hung up on details at this point.
If you have an illustrator to do this part, keep in mind he or she will be working with the graphic elements. Your title might look perfect with the right font, or a clever design.
Depending on your publisher, you may or may not have input on the design of the cover anyway.

Try selling your books at a yard sale.",How to Sell Books1," If you have a pile of well-loved books that you’re trying to resell, the first thing you’ll want to do is get them in tip-top shape. You’ll get a much higher price for a book that doesn’t have rips, bent pages, writing, or frayed edges. Although not all of these things can be fixed, do your best to repair any damage done to your books. Unfold any ‘dog-ears’ and remove old bookmarks or sticky notes, tape the edges to prevent them from fraying further, and patch any tears that might be visible.


For textbooks that are worth quite a bit of money, it may be in your best interest to purchase book-repair materials commonly used by librarians.
If you’ve written in your book, erase marks if possible or use white-out to cover up ink.;
, It may not always be easy to know how much a book is worth, but you should try to find a ballpark price range prior to selling it. That way, you’ll know what to charge or whether you’re being offered a decent amount. Check the price online of books in similar condition as your own; if prices vary, take several that seem ‘normal’ and take the average to get the price for your book. If there are no other copies of your book on the market (it is a vintage copy or textbook), look at books similar to your own to gauge your selling price.


A damaged book will never be worth very much, no matter what the content is.

, If you’re looking for ease and a quick sell, your best option for selling your used books is to try an online store. Look for venues/sellers specific to your type of book - textbooks, vintage, cookbooks, fiction, etc. - and go through the process of registering online with them. There are two general ways you can sell online: sell directly to a large buyer, or create a posting for your book that people can search. The former gives you the fastest means of selling your books, but the latter gives you more control over price and where your books go.


Look on websites like Amazon or Ebay to see what their selling process is like.
If you don’t want to pay for shipping, look into possibly selling locally via a website like Craigslist.

, Although chain bookstores tend to be the go-to for many readers these days, there are plenty of used bookstores around for those of us on the more frugal side. Used bookstores get their stock from people trying to sell books. You go in, drop off the books you want to get rid of, they search/price the books they want, and give you a quote for the total. Used bookstores are nice because they get books off your hands immediately, but they may not buy all your books from you.


It is becoming more and more common for used bookstores to give store credit rather than hard cash for any books they decide to purchase from you. Make sure you check on this policy before trading in your books.
Keep in mind that used bookstores can sell good-quality books for much more money, so if you’re trying to get rid of books that are bent up and damaged, they probably won’t buy them from you.

, If the weather isn’t too bad and you have quite a load of books you’re trying to get rid of, it might be in your best interest to host a garage or yard sale. Here, you’ll be able to set up shop and sell tons of books, fast. Yard sales are a favorite hunting grounds of book lovers, as there tends to be a large variety for little cost. Put your books on display, price them cheaply, and people will be snatching them up off your hands quicker than you can put them out!


Advertise your garage/yard sale a few days in advance for the most traffic. Place an ad in a local newspaper, or put up signs around your house so that people know where to come to.
If you have a friend with lots to sell, you can draw in more people by doubling up and creating a big yard sale. Bringing in more stock from a friend will get people much more interested than just a few books sitting out on a table."

Sell your books online.,
Sell your college textbooks to the college book store.,
Sell your textbooks to students who will need them.,
Sell your books to a used book store.,
Sell your books at a garage sale.",How to Get Rid of Old Books2," Sell books yourself on a site such as eBay, Half, and Amazon. Expect these sites to take a commission of at least 15% of the sales price. Be willing to lower the price over time if the book isn't selling.


To sell your books online, you'll have to set up an account at a website, provide some basic information about the book, and wait for an interested customer to come along.

, If you used the textbooks recently, you may be able to sell them back for a fraction of their original cost. You can call the store in advance to see if this is an option. You'll most likely have to sell the textbooks to the same campus bookstore where you got them, though you could get lucky and find that the textbook store of a different campus is also buying and selling those books.

, Find college students who will be taking a class that you've just finished taking and see if you can sell them your books at a fraction of the cost -- both people will benefit from this exchange. You can ask your friends if they know anyone taking the course in the future, or even stand outside the course after the first day and approach some students who might not have had a chance to buy the books -- just don't be too aggressive.

, Used bookstores typically buy back or give trade credit for selected books in good condition. Most used bookstores will price current titles at around half the cover price and pay around 15% of the cover price in cash, or 20% in trade credit. The store will also look up book values, so if you've priced your book online, that's what a store would expect to sell it for, not what they would pay you for it.


If you want the most money possible, sell the book yourself online; for speed and convenience, offer the books to a used bookstore.

, You can hold a garage sale to sell these books as well as a few larger items to hook some customers. If you're selling some furniture and have some interested customers, you can direct them to your books. You can advertise for the sale through a sign or even by alerting your Facebook friends or friends on other social media that you'll be having a sale -- just make sure you only tell the friends who know well enough to tell your address to.

Host a book swap.,
Host a books-only White Elephant party.,
Trade your old books for new books.,
Trade books for video games, CDs, or movies.",How to Get Rid of Old Books3," Invite a few of your friends over and tell them to bring a box of old books. Then sit around and look through each other's books to find books that might appeal to you as you encourage your friends to take some of your books. Just make sure you don't end up with even more books than you started with.

, During this fun type of gift exchange, all the wrapped books (or ""gifts"") will be placed in the middle of the room. People will take turns selecting gifts and will compete to swap for more desirable gifts. Make it clear that you'll only be swapping old books. A minimum of six people will make this a fun gifting game.

, There are a variety of websites that allow you to trade your old books for new books that you are excited to read. Visit BookMooch, Green Textbooks Recycling, PaperBackSwap, orTitle Trader. For every book you send to someone else, you get a credit towards getting a new book.

, Swap is a web site that allows you to trade your books for other products that may interest you. This is a great way to build up your CD, movie, or video game collection while getting rid of your old books.

Give away your books at a party.,
Give the books to friends who would like them.,
Make a hollowed out book.,
Recycle.",How to Get Rid of Old Books4," Throw a party for a group of your favorite book-loving friends. After an hour or two have passed and a few drinks have been consumed, place a box of your old books in the middle of the room and tell your friends your books are up for grabs. Your friends will rush toward the box and will furiously select a few of your books. You'll be surprised by how quickly the box of books will be empty.

, Go through your books and put post-its on the cover that mark the person who would most appreciate them. Then distribute the books to the few friends you thought of. This will look like a thoughtful gift instead of an attempt to get rid of something. Just tell your friends something like, ""This made me think of you"" or ""I know you'll love this book,"" and they'll gladly take the books off your hands.

, If your book is so old and worn that you and anyone else can have no use for it, have fun by hollowing out the book and using it as a treasure chest to hide your secret things. Here's how you can hollow a book:


Find an old book with a relatively sturdy cover and glue the pages together with Elmer's glue. Wait for them to dry for at least 15 minutes.
Use a pencil to mark the rectangular area at least 1/2 an inch (1.2 cm) within the perimeter of the book.
Use an Exacto knife or a box cutter to cut through a chunk of pages at a time.
Continue to cut through chunks of pages until you've hollowed out the book.
Enjoy storing your favorite items in the book.

, If your books are so decrepit that no one can have a good use for them, it may be time to throw them away. If you do want to throw your books away, recycling is the best and most environmentally-friendly option. Some city recycling programs allow you to put paperbacks into your single-stream recycling bins, and other municipalities will recycle books if brought to a solid waste deposit. Check with your local council website to find out if your books can be recycled.

Make sure your book is in perfect condition.,
Advertise it on social media.,
Do local events and book signings.,
Create a mailing list.,
Do plenty of marketing.",How to Sell Books2," The biggest mistake you can make in selling a self-published book is putting it out on the market while it still has mistakes and needs editing. Make sure that your book has been well-edited, is formatted correctly, and has a matching cover and appearance with the story. A good-looking and clean book will sell many many more copies than a book that has numerous mistakes or an obviously hand-made cover design.


It is worth your money to hire a professional editor or cover designer to help get your book ready for selling.
Don’t rely on friends and family only for opinions/editing help on your book. It will be clear if you were lazy and took the easiest way out for getting your book prepared for selling., You need to make as many people aware of your novel as possible, which means using multiple social media platforms to get the word out. You should be posting regularly about your book on various platforms to get people other than your close friends and family involved. Try using social media like:


Blogs/Tumblr
Facebook
Twitter
Goodreads (like Facebook but for books/authors)
Instagram

, If you make appearances in places where your book-buying audience is likely to be present, you’ll be sure to sell plenty of books. See if any local bookstores, radio stations, or libraries will host you for a public interview or book signing. If you make a public appearance and can use your charm and wit to lure people into reading your book, you’ll be able to get plenty more buyers than just sending your book off to be sold somewhere.


If you can get a book deal at a local store and a book signing event, you’ll be golden.
Getting published in a blog or online magazine might be a great way to get word out about your book. Look into blogs/magazines that tend towards your reading audience, and ask if you can be hosted on their page.

, If you’re able to get a group of fans to sign up for a mailing list, you’ll be one step closer to getting your book into the hands of people who may not have heard of you before. Have people sign up for either letters or emails (the latter are more popular these days) which you can send out any time you have an event or need their support. Using this mailing list strategically will help build stronger relationships with your fans, while using it too frequently and not professionally will cause people to stop following you. Do your best to stoke interest in these lists, and your fans will likely forward them on to other friends and family.

, Marketing isn’t easy; there’s a reason entire college degrees exist in the field. However, if you treat selling your book like a business and do tons of marketing, you’ll sell way more books than a self-publishing author who does not. Hire a marketing agent to help you get your book out in the world, or do a bit of research in marketing on your own. In the end, it will be worth the money and time spent, as you earn it all back and open the eyes of hundreds of readers to your writing."

Consider how your use might affect the work's potential market.,
Consult an attorney.",How to Avoid Copyright or Trademark Violations in Your Self Published Book," Read through your book carefully and make note of any brand names that you've used. Generally, any brand name you use should be capitalized as a proper name. Depending on your usage, you may need to include a disclaimer on the copyright page of your book.For example, if you've written a fictional account of a character who works at Apple, you might want to include a disclaimer that your work is a work of fiction, and that various names used in your novel such as ""iTunes"" are intellectual property of Apple, and that Apple does not sponsor or endorse your work.
You can find general language for a disclaimer online, or by looking at the copyright page of a published book that makes liberal use of trademarked words or phrases.
You also should watch out for words that have slipped into normal speech as generic words but actually are brand names that should be capitalized. For example, ""Band-Aid"" is a trademark, as is ""Kleenex,"" even though people routinely use those terms instead of ""bandage"" or ""tissue.""
When in doubt, a style guide such as the Chicago Manual of Style or the Associated Press Stylebook can help you. Just make sure you pick one and use it consistently.;
, The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has a searchable database of all trademarks with complete or pending registration available on its website. Use it to your advantage when you're screening your book for possible trademark violations.In addition to searching brand names that you might have used in your text, you also want to search for the title of your book as well as character names.
Some established writers as well as film and television companies frequently trademark the names of potential characters for future use, as well as characters that are already well known to prevent other companies from exploiting them.
Generally, if you find your title or the name of a character in the trademark database, you should just change yours. That's the easiest way to avoid a potential trademark violation.

, If you quoted a song or another work anywhere in your book, you often must get permission from the copyright holder to use it in your work. This is especially true for quoting song lyrics.Keep in mind you can always use song, movie, or book titles to reference those works. Any title is considered fair game and you don't need permission to use it.
However, if you're quoting the lyrics of a song or a couple lines of a poem, you typically must secure permission from the copyright owner.
Keep in mind that getting permission to use song lyrics in particular requires contacting the songwriter and his or her publisher, and typically is very expensive. Unless you can afford to spend thousands of dollars to quote a line from a song, you're probably better to leave it out.

, You should have permission for any images you've used, including your cover art. Even if you've purchased a stock photo, not all stock licenses cover the use of the photo for a book cover or anything that involves making copies and selling them.If you're using stock images, read the stock license very carefully. If you have questions regarding whether you can use the image in your book or on its cover, contact the company from which you licensed the photo.
Typically it will be cheaper and more efficient for you to work with an artist directly to create a book cover – but don't expect to get art for free. Working directly with an artist gives you the opportunity to work out a deal in which you pay the artist a little up front and then a small percentage of sales.
Don't think you can use an image just because you found it on the internet. If you want to use a found image, do everything you can to find the original creator of the work. But keep in mind that just because you can't find the creator, that doesn't mean you're in the clear to use the image without getting permission.
Your better option, if you've found an image you want to use but can't find its creator, is to not use the image at all.

, If something is essential to your book, you will want to seek permission to use it. However, in most cases you can simply eliminate any language or trademarked terms that might cause problems.Generally, you should reserve the use of brand names for instances in which you intend to specifically refer to the product or service offered by a particular company. Don't use ""Kleenex"" where the word ""tissue"" would do.
Often you can conjure up the idea of something, such as a song, without quoting it directly. For example, if you have a scene in which a character is singing along with a particular song on the radio, you don't necessarily need to quote the particular lyrics – you can simply name the title of the song and say the character is singing along with it, or that she knows all the words by heart.
If you feel strongly that a certain trademarked word or phrase, or a copyrighted line, is essential to your book, ask yourself why. Get to the bottom of the significance of that particular word or phrase, and dig into the reasons you need it.
You also might want to ask yourself if using the trademarked or copyrighted material adds something to your story or description that couldn't be communicated if you used a substitute.
If you have friends or colleagues who you're using as test readers, have them read two versions of the paragraph or section in which the problematic material appears – one with the copyrighted or trademarked verbiage included, and one with something else substituted.
If your readers feel the text is stronger when it includes the material that potentially infringes on someone's copyright or trademark, you should consider seeking permission to use that work.

, After you've screened your book and eliminated unnecessary words and phrases that potentially infringe someone's copyright or trademark, you may be left with a few potentially infringing uses that you want to keep in your work. For these, you typically must ask permission.Particularly if you have to send several letters, it may be easiest to create a basic spreadsheet. This way you can keep track of when you sent your letter seeking permission, when that letter was received, and your deadline for a response.

, If you need to seek permission from a copyright or trademark owner to use their work in your self-published book, send them a written letter. You can search online for templates to ensure you've covered everything necessary.Sending a written letter the old-fashioned way, rather than sending an email, is crucial for maintaining your paper trail. Potentially, an owner could simply claim they didn't get your letter and sue you for infringement the moment you released your book.
Before you send your letter, you have to know who owns the copyright or trademark in the work you want to use – and sometimes this is easier said than done.
Trademark is simpler, because if the trademark is registered you can find ownership information in the USPTO's database. If the trademark isn't registered, you don't need permission because there is no registered trademark to violate.
Copyright protection, however, exists regardless of whether the copyright is registered. Searching the U.S. Copyright Office's database is a good place to start, but you won't find ownership information if the copyright isn't registered.
If, for example, you found an image on the internet, start by contacting the owner of the website where you first found it. You also can conduct an image search to potentially locate its source.
Once you know to whom you're sending the letter, format it in traditional business letter format, and write in a succinct, professional tone.

, If the work you want to use has a title, use that. In the case of a trademark, describe it specifically and explain the context in which it is used. If you're quoting from copyrighted text, be specific about the portion you want to use and where and how it appears in your book.You also might consider including a copy of the page or pages in which the work appears as an attachment to your letter. This way the copyright owner can completely understand and evaluate the context within which you're using their work.
Keep in mind the interests of the copyright holder. They're not going to give you permission if they believe your use will damage the market for their work, or if they feel it disparages their name or image.

, As succinctly as possible, tell the copyright owner what you are using, how you are using, and the scope of your project. This can be difficult with self-published books, particularly if you are using a print-on-demand service, but you need to make sure if the copyright owner grants you permission it will cover your actual use.If you're using a print-on-demand publishing service, you have no way of predicting how many copies of your book will be sold – so don't try. It may seem safe to say you won't sell more than 100,000 copies of your book, because you're thinking there's no way that will happen. But saying this limits the scope of your license. If you sell 100,001 copies, that last copy will include copyright or trademark violations.
You also shouldn't offer limits that you can't enforce or control. In most cases, you need the right to distribute worldwide, since many print-on-demand services make the product available to anyone in the world with an internet connection.
You don't necessarily need to use fancy legal jargon here. You can just say ""I would like your permission to use the lyrics from your song in my self-published book, which will be printed and distributed online by POD Magic Self-Pub.""

, This portion of your letter is key if you want it to be legally enforceable even if you never receive a response from the copyright or trademark owner. It also means you don't have to delay publishing over worry about the issue still being up in the air.State that unless you hear from them within a week from the date of receipt of the letter, you will assume that they have no problem with you using their work as stated.
It's important to put the ball in their court. If they don't want you to use their work, they must contact you. If you don't hear from them by your deadline, you can consider yourself in the clear.
Giving them a week should be fine, but you may want to give them longer. Don't go more than two weeks, though – you don't want the question to be unresolved for too long.
Make sure you provide a preferred method of contact. If the copyright or trademark owner opts to call you, make sure any agreement you reach over the phone is memorialized in writing. You can send them a letter confirming the conversation.
Do not offer any money. With this initial letter, seek permission to use the trademarked or copyrighted material for free. If you offer money, the person may take it – or attempt to negotiate for more – when they would have given you permission for free if you'd started there.

, Once you've finished writing and proofread your letter, print it and sign it. Make a copy of the signed letter for your own records and keep it in a safe place – ideally with any other legal information or contracts you have related to your book.Use certified mail with returned receipt requested. This way you will get a notification when your letter is received and you'll know when the clock starts ticking on that deadline.
When you get your certified mail receipt back, keep it with your copy of the signed letter you sent.

, While you should always seek permission to use copyrighted work in your self-published book, some uses may qualify for ""fair use,"" a legal doctrine based on the First Amendment.Keep in mind that fair use only comes into play as a defense against infringement – meaning you would have to be sued first. For this reason, it's dangerous to rely on fair use simply as an excuse not to get permission to use a work.
Fair use only applies to copyrighted works, not to trademarked words or phrases. A trademark protects commercial value and commercial uses, and is independent of creative or artistic value.
The fair use doctrine is designed to protect uses for which the copyright owner would be unlikely to give permission, such as when you create a satire of a copyrighted work, or critique it. Fair use also protects scholarly and research uses that have profound social value that overrides the copyright owner's intellectual property interest.
Generally, your use has a strong likelihood of being considered fair use if it transforms the original copyrighted work or adds value to it by creating new understanding or meaning.

, Certain types of work, such as non-fiction or factual works, have thinner protection against fair use than other types of work, such as purely creative works of fiction.No one can claim they hold a copyright in facts, so if the information you're using is factual information, fair use doesn't even come into play. You simply cite the source where you found the information, but you don't need permission to use it.
If you want to quote from unpublished work, you always should have permission from the copyright holder. Although publication is no longer required to enjoy full copyright protection, U.S. copyright law has a strong preference that the creator of a work should have the first opportunity to disseminate it to the public.

, Your fair use claim typically is stronger if you only used a relatively small portion of the copyrighted work within your own. However, how much is too much may depend on how important the part you took is to the work as a whole.If a small portion constitutes the heart of the work, a fair use argument typically falls flat. Depending on the work you're quoting or using, this could be a very small portion indeed.
This is especially true with song lyrics. The line you quote may be a small portion of the overall song, but if it happens to be a refrain that's repeated a half a dozen times throughout the song, you're going to have a hard time getting away with a fair use argument.

, Copyright is at its core an economic right, allowing creators to profit off of their creations. Accordingly, uses that qualify as fair tend to have a relatively slight or marginal negative impact on the market for the original work.Think about this factor in terms of whether your readers would be more or less likely to purchase the copyrighted work after reading your self-published book.
If you have so blasted the original work that you turn readers away from it, you would potentially have a difficult time arguing your use was fair.

, If you have questions about fair use, or are concerned about a problematic passage in your self-published book that you fear may violate someone's copyright or trademark, an intellectual property attorney may be able to answer your questions.Although you may have to pay a few hundred dollars to get a full analysis of your potential intellectual property issues, keep in mind that this amount pales in comparison to the hundreds of thousands of dollars it would cost to raise a defense to an infringement lawsuit.

",How to Distinguish Between a Comic Book and a Graphic Novel," Although ""comics"" encompasses both comic books and graphic novels, a comic book is properly a magazine with volume and issue numbers. A graphic novel is properly a single publication, although some comic publishers have produced a line of graphic novels, as Marvel Comics did from 1982 to 1988 with its series of 35 works.


The use of the word ""novel"" in the pages of a comic book does not automatically make it a graphic novel. The 4-chapter ""novel-length"" stories of All-Flash Quarterly in the 1940s and the 3-part Superman ""novels"" in Action Comics and Superman of the late 1950s and early 1960s are not themselves graphic novels, because they were part of an overall comic book series of stories.
A novel adapted to graphic form may or may not be a graphic novel. The novel adaptations in Classics Illustrated are not themselves graphic novels, because Classics Illustrated was published as a periodical. An adaptation of a single novel across several volumes, such as Jane Fancher's 3-volume adaptation of C.J. Cherryh's ""Gates of Ivrel,"" although not covering the entire novel, may be considered a series of graphic novels by some and a graphic miniseries by others.
Some comics are designated ""one-shot"" comics, such as ""Superman vs. Muhammad Ali,"" published as an oversize (Treasury) edition in 1978. These comics usually have their own volume and issue numbers, usually the number 1. One-shots are not normally considered graphic novels.;
, A comic book may contain a single story, 2 stories, or as many as 3 or 4 stories between its pages, which may or may not all have the same characters. A graphic novel normally contains only a single story with the same cast of characters.


Some bound reprint collections, such as ""The Greatest Superman Stories Ever Told"" and ""The Greatest Batman Stories Ever Told,"" are as thick as graphic novels. These are not properly graphic novels themselves, because they contain more than 1 story, even if the stories feature the same main character. They can be called graphic anthologies, as they follow the format of prose anthologies, which are collections of short stories within a single genre and often with a common theme.
Bound collections of single story arcs, such as Frank Miller's 1986 ""The Dark Knight Returns,"" which was originally published as a 4-issue miniseries, or Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' 1987 ""Watchmen,"" originally published as a 12-issue limited series, are graphic novels because the comic book story arc constitutes a single story within its pages. Each story from the original multiple-issue format constitutes a chapter within the graphic novel.
There have been some exceptions to the ""one story"" definition for a graphic novel. Will Eisner's ""A Contract with God, and Other Tenement Stories"" was a set of interrelated short stories bound in the same volume. (It should be noted that the term ""graphic novel"" was used only on the trade paperback edition and not the earlier hardcover edition.)

, Comic books have a fixed length, which ranged from 64 to 96 pages during the early 1940s and today is around 32 pages. Graphic novels typically run longer, ranging anywhere from 60 to 500 pages. Archie Goodwin and Gil Kane's 1971 ""Blackmark"" ran 119 pages, and its sequel the following year ran 117, while the graphic novel collections of Dave Sim's ""Cerebus"" are nicknamed ""phone books"" by their fans because of how thick they are.


Many comics series produce special longer issues once a year. While these annuals may publish longer stories than the monthly comics with the same title, these cannot usually be considered graphic novels, even if they contain only a single story, as the issue is often identified with the word ""Annual"" and usually bears an issue number.

, Comic books are typically published with a width of 6 5/8 inches (17 cm) and a vertical length of 10 1/4 inches (26 cm). Graphic novels may be published with this length and width, with the dimensions of a trade paperback, an oversize (Treasury) edition, or a digest-size comic.


Trade paperbacks have a width of 5.32 inches (13.5 cm) and a vertical length of 8.51 inches (21.6 cm).
Digest size has a width of 5 3/8 to 5 1/2 inches (13.65 to 13.97 cm) and a vertical length of 7 1/2 to 8 3/8 inches (19.05 to 21.27 cm).

, Comic books traditionally have been bound with staples, much like prose magazines of similar size. Graphic novels, on the other hand, are usually bound the way thicker magazines and books are bound.


Note, however, that some higher-quality special comic books are bound like books. The individual volumes in the 3-issue ""Subterraneans"" Elseworlds miniseries featuring Batman feature high-quality paper and are not bound with staples, but the individual issues are not themselves graphic novels. The overall story, if bound in a single volume, would be a graphic novel.

, For most of the decades they have been published, comic books have been printed on lower-grade matte-finish paper. Graphic novels and anthologies published from the 1980s onward typically are published on a higher grade of paper, either matte or glossy finish. However, many recent comic books have also been published on slick paper, even though they are still held together with staples.

, Because of the limited scope of their stories, their being single publications, and the higher quality printing and binding, graphic novels usually cost more than comic books.

, You will need it for the copyright officer and also your own records so that you can go back and check to see if the file has been removed. To have an exact link, send yourself an email with it and cut and paste the link. You can also send yourself a copy of the full page, with the date uploaded and number of copies.

, Look at the top, bottom, or side of the page for the link (often in very small print) that says something like: copyright policy, copyright protection, removal requests, report violations, or report abuse. Read the policy carefully and collect all the needed information.

, Cut and paste a record of all the information requested, or send yourself a blind copy of the email, including the date of the request. Save it. You will need to return to the site in a few days and from time to time to make sure the file has been removed and that no other copies have been uploaded. Pirates are tricky and very determined.

, This is usually on a link on the same page of the site as the file, though the name is usually a screen name. Read the profile and consider sending a message to them. Many are well-meaning but naive people who do not understand that they are passing along stolen material. They might be chagrined and promptly remove all the ebooks they aren’t sure are legitimate. Others are defiant rebels who consider themselves heroes, and you’re better off not triggering their alert system. If you see that the person has uploaded dozens or even hundreds of files, this is clearly a career pirate. Most sites will ban them if you report them with proof of the piracy and will remove all of that offender’s uploads. By reporting them, you aren’t just handling your own problem, you’re doing a favor to other authors the thief has victimized.

, Again, be reasoned and polite, not threatening legal action. They don’t need or want to read about your emotions, and emoting does seem to slow down their response time. What they generally need is proof that you’re the author and copyright owner and that you did not authorize the file. If it was actually copyrighted it through the government copyright office, say so and provide a number if possible. Send yourself a copy of the note also. Here’s a format that generally works well:



For a hardcopy book: “I am _____, the author and copyright owner of ____ published in hardcopy by ______ in (date). A pirated version has been uploaded to your site without my knowledge or permission by _____ (link to the member who uploaded the file). The book appears at this link on your site: _____ and I note that _____ unauthorized free copies have already been downloaded. The book is for sale on my website at _____ (or the publishers website or on Amazon.com). Let’s work together to get this file removed. You may write to me at ____.

For an ebook: “I am _____, the author and copyright owner of the ebook _____ published by _____. A pirated version has been uploaded to your site without my knowledge or permission by ____(link to the member who uploaded the file). The ebook appears at this link on your site: ____ and I note that ____ unauthorized free copies have already been downloaded. The book is for sale on my website at ____ (or other site where the book is sold on the web). Let’s work together to get this file removed. You may write to me at _____.

, Go back to the site in a few days to see if the file has been removed, and also use the site’s search engine to make sure it hasn’t been reloaded by someone else or the same person with a new screen name. If it hasn’t been removed in a week, write to the copyright officer again with the original date and information. Ask if there’s anything else they need from you as proof of your claim, and again, say, “Let’s work together to remove this file.” Bookmark and revisit the site again periodically.

Examine the questions at the end of each section or chapter.,
Read the chapter intro and final summary.,
Look carefully at section headings and subheadings.,
Read the first and last sentence of paragraphs.,
Pay attention to important concepts and details only.,
Break up the chapter with your classmates.",How to Read Textbooks Faster1," Use these questions as a guide to help you focus on the important and relevant material. As you are skimming the chapter, ask yourself if the material you are reading is answering these questions. If it is not, then skip it., Look for key words like “effects,” “results,” “causes,” “versus,” and “pros and cons,” for example. These key words will clue you into the chapter’s thesis or main idea. Knowing the main ideas beforehand will help you identify sections of the chapter that need careful reading.Highlight and refer back to the main idea or thesis so you can stay on topic.

, Rephrase section headings and subheadings into questions to help you focus on the important ideas being presented. If the section heading says, “Kramer’s Three Social Laws,” then rephrase it into a question by saying, “What are Kramer’s three social laws?” Then read the information that answers this question.Remember that bolded or italicized headings and subheadings contain clues to the most important information.

, If you understand these two sentences, then just skim or skip the paragraph. If you do not understand the first and last sentences, then read the entire paragraph.Make sure to slow down when you encounter complex paragraphs and sentences. This way, you will be able to fully understand what the author is trying to articulate in the paragraph.

, Skim the book for important concepts, people, places, and events. These are usually bolded or italicized. If you understand a concept, then you can skip the contextual information that explains it.Read the supporting text and contextual information only if you do not fully understand a concept.

, Ask some of your classmates if they are willing to do this. If they are, assign sections of the chapter amongst one to three other classmates. Each classmate should be responsible for their section. Make sure that you all can come to an agreement about each person's responsibilities.For example, devise a plan where each student in the group reads and writes a detailed outline for their respective section. Then, have everyone complete their outline by a certain date like the end of the week.

Define a goal.,
Take notes in the margins.,
Summarize what you read in your own words.,
Create a study environment that is free of distractions.",How to Read Textbooks Faster2," You can do this by asking yourself pre-reading questions such as, “What is the author’s main idea?” “What does my teacher want me to focus on in this chapter?” “What have I already learned or not learned about this topic?”These questions will help you focus on important and relevant content that will enhance your leaning while excluding information that is irrelevant or that you already understand.

, In addition to highlighting, write questions and comments in the margins of your textbook or on a sheet of paper if the book does not belong to you. This will help you engage with the material and retain the information better, and thus prevent you from having to read the section over again.Make diagrams, flow charts, and outlines of the material when you can.
Make sure to focus on and define terms that you are unfamiliar with.

, Write down the main points on a sheet of paper. Use examples to clarify the main points. If you are not able to summarize key information, then you may need to go over relevant sections once more.Limit your summary to one page.

, Pick a quiet space in your house, for example your room, or the library to read. Put away other sources of distraction like your phone, computer, and the Internet. Instead, read the chapter and write your notes by hand, and silence your phone or turn it off.Additionally, make sure the the space you choose is well-lit and comfortable, but not too comfortable.
If you choose to study at home, let your family (or roommates) know that you will be studying quietly in your room and that you would appreciate it if they kept the noise level down.

Give yourself a time-frame.,
Use a pointer to focus on the material.,
Try not to sub-vocalize.,
Control the speed of your reading.",How to Read Textbooks Faster3," Tell yourself, “I will read this chapter for one and a half hours.” Giving yourself a time-frame will help you stay on track as you read. If you begin to notice that you are reading a section for too long, get the main points and move on.Mark the section and come back to it if it is a particularly difficult section.

, As you read, place your finger (or an index card or pen) below the first word of the sentence and move it as you read. Your finger will help your eyes focus on the words you are reading, instead of other pictures and information.Additionally, using a pointer can you help control how fast or slow you read something; for example, the faster you move your finger the faster you will read and vice versa.

, Sub-vocalization is reading aloud in your head and/or moving your lips as you read. There is nothing inherently wrong with this, but it can slow down your reading rate. Reduce your sub-vocalization by chewing gum or listening to music while you read. By forcing yourself to read faster you may also be able to reduce sub-vocalization.Additionally, there are apps and programs that can help you reduce your sub-vocalization.

, Reading faster isn’t just about reading fast, but about controlling your speed. In other words, slow your reading when you encounter concepts that you are unfamiliar with or do not understand. Then, increase your speed once you have gauged the meaning."

Understand what a spoiler is and why it occurs.,
Start reading.,
Expect to enjoy the book.,
Be skeptical about the spoilers that you think you already know.,
Keep in mind that movie plots and book plots frequently diverge and vary in depth.,
Be someone who loves spoilers.,
Avoid times when you might be confronted by spoilers.,
Don't go looking for spoilers online.While there are many opportunities to find out what a book's contents are, if you have the slightest peek at spoiler sites or reviews, you only have yourself to blame!

,
Remember that no ""spoiler"" can ruin a truly great book.",How to Enjoy a Spoiled Plot Book," In terms of a book, a spoiler is something that reveals critical elements of the plot, and often includes the ending. It will usually be parts of a book that would otherwise be surprising for the reader.Reasons for a spoiler might include:



Reviewing the book and critiquing it.
Excitement of a reader who wants to share his or her appreciation of or annoyance with the book with others.
Naïveté of a reader who doesn't believe it will spoil another person's reading of the book, or doesn't realize that you haven't yet read the book.
A spoilsport who wants to ruin someone else's experience of the book; perhaps someone showing off or just being mean-spirited.;
, Part of the problem may well be that you simply won't start the book because a voice in your head keeps insisting that it's not worth the effort. Stop listening to that voice, start reading, and let your reaction to the first chapter or so be the real test of whether or not you want to continue reading. Chances are, if the book is good, you will be compelled to keep reading even though you know the plot or a key element.

, Since it's clearly already popular and well talked about, there will be a lot to enjoy throughout the book, and it's important to keep in mind that books can still be enjoyed even if you know how it ends or know the ""big twist"". You already know what happened, but you can still probably read to figure out why and how it happened. And no matter how much you have already heard, it won't ever be possible to truly grasp the manner in which the book is written and how it comes across in tone and narrative until you are personally reading it.


There will be plenty of parts of the book that you won't yet know. Spoilers are about the most popular, surprising parts of the book. They aren't the whole book and indeed, there may be parts that resonate a great deal more with you than the spoiled parts. But you won't know until you've read it for yourself!
Expect the funny parts to be original. Spoilers often don't convey the funnier parts of a book well because these are not the surprising twists in the book. And it's actually very hard to convey the precise humor out of a book in a review or by recounting – you kind of have to ""be there"" to ""get it""!

, Try not to overthink what you've already been told or your expected reading experience. You might have heard or read a lot of opinions about the plot but that doesn't mean they are either right or representative of what will be your own experience. In fact, you can have a lot of fun reading and thinking about other people's takes on the plot. You might find yourself scoffing, ""Whoa! Joe was so wrong about that interpretation of what character X does in this scene! What a load of rot! What really happens is X, Y, and Z!"". Consider these points:


It's possible the person retelling the story doesn't understand the narrative elements or misunderstands the psychological underpinnings and misconstrues what really is going on.
Narrative devices are not always clearly conveyed by spoilers. For example, you might know about the ending precisely because the author begins at the end and then unfolds the plot as to how the story reaches that ending (a reverse chronology). Or, it might be a case that the story begins in the middle (in media res) and the flashbacks leading up to that point are poorly conveyed by the spoiler. And the spoilers may not have revealed the delightful red herrings strewn throughout the book. There are many narrative devices that won't be fully appreciable until you delve into the book yourself, in spite of spoilers.
Savor surprises. There still might be something not major in the plot that surprises you, that hasn't been discussed or reviewed.
Focus on the subjective elements that are in the realm of the reader's interpretation, not that of the reviewer. For this, you would do well to look for such narrative devices as MacGuffins (a prime motivation for a reader that is never adequately explained to the reader), flashbacks and flash-forwards, prophecies, foreshadowing, etc. All of these elements are for your own exploration for a deeper understanding, to be interpreted through your own experience of life and feelings for the characters. You might be pleasantly surprised at how much you differ in opinion about the rationales and outcomes of the book that other people have presumed to be a certain way.
Don't anticipate the spoiled element coming up, or try to predict when it will happen; maybe the spoiler wasn't even true? Then you will be twice as surprised!
Relish the fact you know the ending but not the how, a common narrative device in plays such as those by Shakespeare, or movies that begin with the end. You know the ending but you're a lot less certain of how the characters and story get to that ending.

, If you have seen a movie version of a book before reading the book, there is even less reason to fret about a spoiled plot. Movies simply do not have the luxury of being able to go into the same level of depth as a book. So, while you may have the general gist from a movie, there are likely to be a lot of surprises and revelations for you when reading the book. Some of the things that might happen include:


A deeper understanding of what has motivated characters - perhaps you have wondered why a movie character has been so one-dimensional; the book read might prove otherwise.
A different ending from what you expected (movies often change endings for Hollywood preferences).
Additional characters, scenes, action, etc., that the movie didn't have room for. Of especial interest are those characters that get the chop in the movie but are of added interest in the book.

, There are people who thrive on spoilers as a way to inform them before they start reading, as a form of incentive!Knowing what the ending is and how the plot unfurls can sometimes be a way of avoiding unpleasant surprises, or be a form of motivating your reading. There are various websites devoted to spoilers, which provide a discussion point for people who like spoilers, which can be a reason of itself to enjoy spoilers as you get to argue the finer points or even veracity of spoilers with others online.

, There are some occasions when you're more likely to be exposed to spoilers than normal:



Book club meet ups – always expect at least one person to have already read the book and to be ready to spill the beans.Book reviews – whether or not a book review will reveal the plot will depend on the purpose for which it is being written. If it is for promoting the book's sales and readership, it is unlikely to give away the plot and ending; if, however, it is for the purpose of critiquing the book (often the case in blogs), it may well reveal the ending and major plot elements. You will need to judge according to the context of the review before reading further. Many reviewers will use the phrase ""spoiler alert"" if they are about to reveal major elements of the plot or ending. You have been warned!
Websites – reader reviews, forums, blog posts.
You see someone with a copy of the book and they're talking about just having finished it – let them know quickly that you don't want to know the ending!

,, Many avid readers will confess that they have read a number of books over and over, and enjoyed them more with each subsequent reading. Books are stories, and sometimes you need time to ruminate or meditate on the story, the way it was told, how it ties in to other stories.


Think ""Titanic"" - the movie was based on an event almost a century prior to when the movie was made. Everyone knew how it had to end, and yet it was one of the most popular movies of all time. No spoiler will ever make reading a great story pointless.
Another recent example: An episode of Doctor Who featured Vincent Van Gogh. Everyone knows who Van Gogh was, and most know that he took his own life at a young age. Yet the story was widely considered one of the best of this series ever, because it wasn't about Van Gogh's death. It was about his life, and it tied into a previous episode in which a regular character leaves the earthly plane; it was about seeing beauty and feeling inadequate despite having tremendous talent, and also about the importance in each of our lives of leaving a legacy and being remembered after we die. A great story is a great story, whether you know what happens in the end or not.
Old Yeller. Most people know (possible spoiler alert) that Old Yeller, the dog, dies, but that doesn't mean it's not beautifully written classic!

Walk into a bookstore or librarywith a specific ideal in mind.,
Do a keyword search of your library's Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC) and/or a website such as amazon.com to see if you can find a resource that matches your needs.,
Perform ""foot patrol"" of the reference shelves.,
Begin from the end.,
Think up a few questions that you know the answer to.,
Read the passages and decide for yourself whether it seems knowledgeable or if it's too vague on the topic(s).",How to Choose a Good Reference Book," This ideal should be based around exactly how detailed you want the book to be. Do you want it general and simple (a general overview of globalization, a definition of a computer term etc.)? Or are you searching for a more verbose manuscript (The Encyclopedia of Internal Medicine, Complete History of China, etc.)? Once you've decided on the level of detail you are looking for, you may move on to the next step.;
, Additionally, the Online Computer Library Consortium's WorldCatcan help you search for books at a library near you (including reference sources).

, Browse around and see if you can find what you want. In libraries, it helps to have a general idea of the classification systems used (Library of Congress, Dewey Decimal etc.). If you can't find what you want during your ""foot patrol"", ask a librarian or bookstore employee.

, Go directly to the index of a book that looks sufficient along the lines of the topic you're interested in -- ignore the fancy cover and how many pretty pictures it might have. What truly defines a good reference book is its rear.

, Ask the book these questions. (Not literally or you'll get some strange looks from other customers and possibly be asked to leave when you get angry because the book won't answer you directly.) Scan the index for the answers and follow it through the book.

, Ideally, chances are if it couldn't answer something you already knew, it won't be able to answer any of the other questions you will eventually have.

Know what general sort of dictionary you need.,
Look for newer words.,
Look for proper nouns.,
Look for slang and vulgar words.,
Check for regional words, if you know them in the language(s) your dictionary treats.,
Examine the reference matter at the front and back.,
Find out how the dictionary handles terms with multiple meanings.,
Notice whether the dictionary includes phrases and idioms and see how it handles them.,
Read a few sample definitions.",How to Choose a Dictionary," Here are the basics you should decide before you begin looking:



Languages. Are you looking for a dictionary in English, with definitions in English? Are you looking for a translating dictionary, a book that will allow you to look up words in your language and find words in another language?

Size. For print dictionaries, will you be carrying this dictionary with you in a pocket, purse, or briefcase or will it remain on a desk or bookshelf somewhere?

Scope. Do you want a general dictionary? Do you want a dictionary that includes technical terms or terms relating to a particular field or specialty? Some dictionaries specialize in words pertaining to certain subjects, such as music or law.

Binding. Do you care if your dictionary is hardcover or paperback? Do you prefer a book that will stay open by itself, or do you mind holding the pages open while you use it?

Print or digital format. Printed dictionaries require no electricity to operate. On the other hand, they are updated only by purchasing a new one.;
, New words enter the language all the time. Ask yourself, does the dictionary include current technology and computer terms?

, Does the dictionary mention Arizona? Does it mention important people?

, Even if you think you already know these words in your own language or you don't wish to use them, you may not want to neglect them in another language, simply to understand what others are saying.

, For example, the words biscuit, cookie, chips, and crisps mean slightly different things depending on where in the English-speaking world you hear them. If your dictionary is written for a certain region, be sure you know which region it is before you buy it.

, Does it have a pronunciation key? Do you understand it and know how to use it? Did you have to read the pronunciation key, or could you make a pretty good guess? If it is a translating dictionary, does it include a usage section or a phrasebook section? Are these features that you will use when using this dictionary?

, This is particularly important in a translating dictionary. In English word ""board"" can mean a piece of wood, and it can mean a committee. In most other languages, you will need a bit of guidance to choose the correct translation according to your meaning.

, Again, these can vary between regions, so be sure to note if regional differences are mentioned.

, Try to choose both familiar and unfamiliar entries. Are they clear? Do you understand them? In an English dictionary, are etymologies listed and are they clear? Does the dictionary give examples of the word in use? Are they citations from published works? Does the dictionary include synonyms or other information about the word?

Hold the books.,
Consider the purpose of the book.,
Consider the price.,
Consider the time delay, if any.,
Take into account the difference in durability.,
Consider the long-term environmental impact.,
Decide if you want the book now or later.,
Note that sometimes there is no choice.,
Throw non-print books into the equation.,
Don't be a slave to preferring one type over another.,
View the publication of your own book in a similar light to the reader's decisions for purchasing one type of book over another:


Is your book likely to be popular and used as a reference work or become a bestseller?,
Consider whether it is either viable or possible for you to print a run of both hardcover and softcover books.,
Consider producing eBooks and books for eReaders and the iPad.",How to Choose Between Paperback and Hardback Books," Feel sense is a very important part of whether to choose a paperback or a hardback book. For many people, there is an obvious and immediate reaction of texture, weight, and strength. Even the odor of the book can captivate or disturb the reader. However, whether you prefer a hardcover or a paperback may vary between books depending on the size and amount of pages, so it isn't always a given that just because you prefer one type of book over another that this will always be the case for all of your books.



Be honest with yourself. Some people love hardcovers because they're pretty.Really. It can be as simple as that!

, Hardcover books are made for durability. As such, they are an excellent choice when it comes to reference texts that you will be using often, such as dictionaries and thesauruses, quote books, professional texts such as case law and medical or veterinary manuals, great literary works, and so forth. In addition, hardcover is best for larger sized books such as atlases, coffee table books (paintings, scenery, photography, etc.), and similar large sized books. On the other hand, softcover or paperback books are great when you take them with you on public transportation, when you're traveling, or when you're reading in bed at night because they're not as heavy or cumbersome to carry or hold.


Do you enjoy reading a heavy or a light book in bed? Everyone has their own preferred method for snuggling up with a book and for some, the hardback versions are just too heavy while for others, they offer the required stability amid the marshmallow crevices of pillows and mattress!

, Most bookstores, chain or not, sell the paperback for a cheaper price than the hardback.This is because paperbacks are easier to manufacture. Hardbacks have a longer printing and production process that can be quite costly (better quality paper, harder cover, more paper used, etc.); printers set the prices on them higher so that they can get their money back.

, Hardbacks are usually the first version of the book. A couple of months after the publication of the hardcover, the paperback comes out – possibly with new information, such as an excerpt for the sequel, extended endings, or Q & A's from the author.If you're a book collector or you're collecting books of a particular author or series, the hardback first edition book is usually the preferred edition and is usually the book you'd buy for collection purposes. High value books, such as those from the Harry Potter series, tend to come out in hardback form first because they already have a high known value., A hardback would be better in terms of durability. Hardback books tend to have higher quality printing standards. They're usually made with acid-free paper (a pH of 7, neutral), which ensures their durability long-term. The paper is usually stitched and glued to the spine.Paperbacks are made less for durability and more for mass consumption. They have easy portability but also lack the durability of a hardcover and they may also suffer from foxing (yellowing and spotting), marking, lose pages, etc., much sooner than you'd find with a hardback.


Hardback books are protected by their binding in a way that paperback books are not and may be less prone to tear and wear as a result and are less likely to get dog ears. Although, be aware that libraries will often request that you do not return large hardcover books through the after hours chute, as these books can be easily damaged if they land awkwardly when dropped from a height. And while a paperback can be easily bent out of shape, the flexibility of a paperback can be its saving grace when carrying it about as it can squish into small bags and provided you take care, still come out okay for a good read!

, Like everything else, books wear out eventually and are no longer worth selling or even donating. While many single-stream city recycling programs accept paperback books along with newspapers, cardboard, etc., the glue in the binding of hardcover books makes them ineligible for some city recycling programs. If this is important to you, ask your local recycling service their policy on recycling worn-out books.

, Your desired book may be released in hardback first. If a book is released in hardback form first (as most books are), they are most likely destined to be successful and you'll have to wait awhile before it's published in paperback version. It all depends on how ""up-to-date"" you want to be or if you have the patience to wait. Even if it isn't released as a hardback first, that paperback shouldn't be shunned! It might just pleasantly surprise you.


You can circumvent the waiting period and the cost by placing a hold on hardcover bestsellers at your local library. Free and hardcover; now that's a perfect combination!

, Sometimes the book is only ever published in one or other format for reasons of cost, durability, marketing promotion, and so forth. In that case, the choice has been removed from you and you'll just have to go with whatever is provided.

, With the advent of eReaders and iPads, the avid reader has yet another type of book to consider. While not printed on paper, many eReaders have been formulated to look just like the pages of a printed book and the iPad has some very fun interactive features for books. The benefit of these electronic gadgets over books is that they're lightweight and can hold more than one book; indeed many of the eReaders can hold hundreds of books. On the other hand, they don't look, smell, or handle like a book and they're probably not as convenient when researching or writing an article as you can't have several of them open at once (unless you happen to be wealthy enough to own several of them at once but that's sort of wasteful in comparison to books). And they need juice, so when their battery is flat and you're in the middle of nowhere without electricity, your trusty book will still give you the satisfaction of a good read.

, Finally but importantly, don't lock yourself into only ever choosing one type and not the other. Each book or eBook has its benefits and its disadvantages dependent on all of the factors above and dependent on your intended end use. Give yourself the flexibility to chop and change between formats as needed.

, If so, choose hardback first.
Is your book testing the waters, a first off print run, a novelty or specialist topic, or just a big unknown? If so, choose softcover first.
Are you trying to keep down the costs of your print run? If so, choose softcover first.
What are your readers likely to prefer? (You're going to have to stand in their shoes a bit for this one.);
, This might enable you to meet the needs of each type of reader. However, it's likely that your budget will be the ultimate deciding factor here as this will definitely be a more costly way to produce the book.

, These are increasingly popular formats for publishing in and you might not even need to publish in print form!

Visit a textbook buyback price comparison website.,
Look for the Textbook's Original List Price.,
Look at the Textbook's Condition.,
Determine The Price of Your Textbook.",How to Price Used Textbooks for Sale," You may want to visit a web site that buys and sells used books before you try to sell your own used textbook. After going to a used textbook sell back web site, you can search for the value of the used textbook in question by using that book's ISBN number. This gives you an idea of how much the used textbook pricing is selling for to book buyback companies which is sometimes more than the price on Amazon, especially when you consider the commission you have to pay Amazon which is 15%.;
, You should also look for the original value of the textbook you are trying to sell. You can do this by looking on the back of the book. If the original value is not found on the back of the textbook, you can visit an online bookseller for more information about the book. For example, you can find out the original value of a specific textbook at Amazon and other online web sites. All you need to do is type in the ISBN number of the textbook and look at the list price of the book.

, Now you need to look at the condition of the textbook. Check out the cover and look for any tears, bends, or markings on the cover of the book. Once you have taken note of any changes to the book, you should flip through it to make sure that there are not too many notes, highlights, or underlined information. Although a little bit of notes and highlights will not harm the price of the book, a very beat up textbook will not be sold at a very decent price.

, If you bought the book brand new and it is still in good condition, you should take around 25 percent off the original list value. If you bought the book used, you can take 25 percent off the price that you paid for the book. Make sure that you take more money off if the book is in bad condition.

Search for your book in the library's card catalog.,
Obtain the call number contained in a book's entry.,
Go to the shelves.,
Look for a label matching both the call number and the author's last name.",How to Use the Dewey Decimal System1," This system is likely computerized. If you are having trouble, ask a librarian for help or have her simply look it up for you.


The Dewey Decimal System applies only to nonfiction books. This system organizes the books by topic, ranging from genetics to Victorian England to astrology.;
, The call number will contain three digits or more. Record both the number and the author's last name before you begin your search.

, Skim the spines of the books you pass to find the ones with the same first digit as your desired book. Then search those books for ones with the same second digit, and so on. Here's an example:


Let's say you are looking for a book with Dewey Decimal number 319.21.
Find the aisle that 319 would fall under, ignoring the decimals for now. For example, ""300.2–340.99"" would be the correct aisle, since 319 falls between 300 and 340.
Walk down the shelf looking at the spines until you find the books beginning with 319.
Search within the books beginning 319 to find the one you're looking for. These are arranged by the value of the decimal, so 319.21 falls between 319.20 and 319.22.

, There may be multiple books with the same call number, so check the author's name to confirm that you've found the one you selected in the card catalog.

, Each of the ten areas contain 99 divisions - more specific categories that fall under the larger areas. Additional decimals indicate the even even smaller sections, which are even more specific. Decimals are added if the topic is even more specific. An example of this specification process is below:


500 Natural Sciences and Mathematics
  590 Zoology
    595 Arthropods
      595.7 Insects
        595.78 Lepidoptera
          595.789 Butterflies

, The Dewey Decimal System is great when you're browsing. If you wanted a book on Ethics, for example, you would go to 170. Once you were there you could scan the shelves for a book on an area of Ethics that interested you. This is infinitely more convenient than alphabetical arrangement, in which you might find a book on turtles next to one about turbulence in politics.

, If your library is large and you would rather not spend a whole day browsing books on the Arts, you could go online for a guide to the various general categories, divisions, and sections. Websites with Dewey Decimal System guides include OCLC, The University of Illinois, IPL.

Spot Waldo’s clothes.,
Focus on landmarks.,
Know where else Waldo is not.",How to Find Waldo1," In the beloved “Where’s Waldo” books by Martin Handford, readers are supposed to look for a cartoon man named Waldo. Knowing what to look for is where you must start.Waldo wears a red-striped shirt and a red-striped hat. Be careful, though, because the illustrator has planted other people with red stripes in an attempt to fool you. There should be a picture of Waldo on the cover of the books.

Create a picture of Waldo in your “mind’s eye” by studying his picture for a few minutes. This helps your brain seek out similar colors and images in the pages.Waldo also has round black glasses, and a walking stick/brown wooden cane with a curved top.Waldo wears brown work boots.Waldo wears blue jeans with pockets. He has short brown hair with longer bangs that are swept to the right. He usually has a smile on his face.;
, One technique that can be effective is to focus on landmarks where Waldo might be hiding out, rather than just wildly looking around.


Look around landmarks like a castle moat or a blimp or other central elements to the scene. Waldo often carries objects with him. This could be a camera, camping gear, a teacup, or any other relevant accessory. Sometimes, looking for these things on the page will lead you right to Waldo!
Handford has said that he didn’t strive to be purely random when choosing where to put Waldo. Instead, he said that he puts “Wally when I come to what I feel is a good place to hide him.”
Most of the Waldo books also contain a postcard from Waldo in the top left-hand corner of the left page when you open a two-page spread. Waldo is never hidden here.

, Various studies have found that there are some places Waldo almost never appears on the page.


Waldo is almost never spotted in the page’s top left-hand corner. He is rarely located on the edges of pages, and he is never found on the bottom of the right page.
Waldo is called different names around the world. He is Ubaldo in Italy, Jonas in Lithuania, Walter in Germany, Wally in the UK and Australia, and Van Lang in Vietnam.Have fun with it! Challenge yourself by scanning the page, and seeing how long it takes you to find Waldo without extra help."
"
Look near the middle area of the page.,
Look in the middle bands of the page.,
Find other characters.",How to Find Waldo2," A graduate student named Randal S. Olson used computer science to create a way to find Waldo in each of the seven books in the “Where’s Waldo” series.


Olson charted where Waldo appears in each of the books. He found that Waldo is usually not found in the left corner or around the edges of pages. The bottom part of the right page is somewhere Waldo never appears.Olson even created a heat map that included a line for you to follow if you want to increase your chances of finding Waldo. It’s rather complex, but you can find it online.Olson claimed he could find Waldo in 10 seconds, and sometimes even less than that. Start at the bottom half of the left page. Then move your way up to the middle and then down the right side of the page.

, Others have also tried to study Waldo’s hiding spots looking for patterns to help readers. They too have found that Waldo is often found near, although not exactly at, the page's middle.


Waldo is not hiding all of the time in any single one corner of a page. He found that Waldo is rarely in the right-hand corner at the top of the right page. In general, Waldo is not found as often near the bottom or top of a page.
However, more than half of the time, Waldo is hiding within one of two 1.5-inch tall bands. The first one is located three inches from the page’s bottom. The other one is seven inches from the bottom. Waldo is also not likely to be found in the middle of the page, but just above or below it in one of these two bands.
Both of these bands stretch from one end of the page to the other when the book is open wide. Start by studying these areas to increase your chances of finding Waldo quickly. He is not always located there; he is just located there more often.

, Initially, Waldo was the only character to find in each scene, but as more books have been created, other characters were added.


Wally or Waldo has a friend named Wilma who appeared in the Ultimate Fun Book. Her twin sister replaced her in Where’s Wally: The Magnificent Poster Book.
Odlaw opposes Wally. He looks a lot like Wally, but he wears yellow and black striped clothes. His glasses are blue tinted, and he has a mustache.
Wally has a dog named Woof, who shows up in the Ultimate Fun Book. The Wizard Whitebeard is a background character who often goes along on Wally’s travels. You might find Waldo located near these characters.

Look online.,
Download a Waldo app.,
Use tricks to find Waldo in the app.,
Look at the scenery in which Waldo appears.",How to Find Waldo3," Waldo is a cottage industry of his own. In addition to puzzles and the books, you can find online Waldo riddles and games.It works the same way; you are given a complicated photo that includes a sea of people and you're tasked with spotting Waldo.
Sometimes you will be given a multiple sentence riddle containing clues as to his location.
Waldo is often harder to spot because the illustrator uses colors to fool you. For example, don’t assume he’s in the seas of red you see.

, There are Waldo apps you can download on the Android and iOS smartphones. The newest apps are free.The plot involves a twister that has torn through the countryside, and you must locate Waldo and other hidden objects that the twister has scattered about, or they will be lost in the sea.
Unusual stories accompany each new land. You will use a map to visit each of the lands, and will earn coins as you find the objects in them.
The coins are used to unlock new lands. The game is called Waldo & Friends. One downside of it is that it contains ads. The positive is that if you are done with all of the Waldo books, there are plenty of other places you can find Waldo!

, You can increase your chances of finding Waldo in the app with a few quick strategies.Try playing the same scene again and again so you figure out where objects are placed, and you will be able to find them when you play again.
When you find an object, don’t tap it right away. If you find more objects nearby and tap them to get combos, you will end up with a higher final score.
Save bones for really tough scenarios because you can use them to instantly find an item. Wait until the final star of the game because they’re hard to get.

, Look for the colors that stand out in Waldo's clothes, or look for the hat. These items will either be differently colored from the surrounding scenery or will stand out as something out of context.


Watch out for Waldo lookalikes! Often, there will be Waldo impostors in red-and-white striped shirts or glasses, there to trick you into thinking you've found Waldo.
Be sure to look closely at the image you find to make sure it's the true Waldo.
Look for ""extras."" Often, scanning for the bonus items on each page, you'll uncover Waldo along the way! It's a two-for-one that can save many valuable minutes in your day.

Do you have a skill or interest you would like to share? Volunteer to give a presentation. Public libraries are geared to serve the community, and participation by their patrons is an effective way to assess the community's needs.



, Most libraries have an online database, although a few small libraries may still use a card catalog. The collection can be accessed through the title, author, subject, and other criteria.
Search online. Many libraries have computers available for searching, and have access to online databases not readily accessible to popular search engines.
If the library doesn't have what you're looking for, you can request it through inter-library loan.

Some inter-library loan requests may require a fee. Ask in advance if there is any cost involved.

Clarify your personal mission statement.,
Develop a reasonable monthly or yearly budget.,
Develop a time line to acquire books.,
Determine a specialization.,
Create a library environment that is spacious enough to hold books, computers and a study area.",How to Set Up Your Own Reference Library1," Most libraries have a mission statement that helps to identify their goals, acquisitions, funding, organization and more. Although this need not be a formal document, it is a good idea to clarify your goals before starting to build a personal library.;
, Unlike city or school libraries that are at least partially publicly funded, a personal reference library relies on your own funds. If you have a small budget, you may want to look into acquiring used books, rather than new books.

, Unless you have a very large budget from the outset, you should follow the general rules of all libraries and create an acquisition plan.


For example, if you have $100 per month, you may plan to acquire at least 3 new books per month, every month for 2 years. You will have 72 books after 2 years, if you follow this plan. If you plan to buy used books because you have a budget of $50, you may be able to find 4 books per month, resulting in 98 books in your reference library after 2 years.

, Most reference libraries are somewhat defined by the personal interests of the people creating it. After plans are made to acquire the staples of a reference library, such as an encyclopedia and an atlas, you may want to start collecting based on your interests.


For example, possible specialized topics include biblical studies, natural science, psychology, music, travel or art.

, This may be a room, or a large corner of a room, but it should be dedicated to the reference library, in order to preserve organization and provide a quiet study space. Include the following items in your library:


Find sturdy bookcases with adjustable shelves. Many reference books are larger and heavier than fiction books. You can hire someone to build in your bookcases, or you can buy freestanding bookcases at most furniture stores. If you have freestanding bookcases, make sure they are anchored to the walls.
Add a computer and computer desk. An online database is the best way to catalog your books. An online research center is also a necessary part of any reference library. The computer desk should be set up with a chair.
Make room for a library table. These tables are long and flat, so that you can lay out more than 1 book at a time when you are doing research. The table should be large enough so you can lay out large atlases, with room to spare for a notebook.
Find a comfortable reading chair, if you plan to do extensive reading in your library. Many people prefer to have a well-upholstered chair where they feel comfortable sitting for a couple of hours.
Add incandescent lighting to limit eyestrain. Your room should have task lighting above work stations and the reading chair, so that you can see your pen, paper and book pages. Task lighting can be provided by pendant lamps or standing lamps. It should also include ambient lighting that fills the room with enough light to see the book spines on the shelves. This is usually provided by overhead lights or fixtures near the ceiling.
Choose ambient lighting that is separate from task lighting. It is not a good idea to place lighting directly on the books themselves for long periods of time. Over time the books will be damaged by harsh lighting or sunlight. Turn off the ambient lighting when you have collected your books and you are under your task lighting.
Buy a library ladder or stool, if you have tall, custom built shelves. This will help to avoid falls and allow you to access your entire library.

"
"
Buy an up-to-date dictionary.,
Collect atlases of the world and your local area.,
Go to library auctions.,
Choose a reputable encyclopedia collection.,
Subscribe to magazines in your area of interest.,
Include other media, such as classical music, documentaries, photographs and newspaper clippings.,
Visit antique and rare book sellers.,
Search textbook and reference publishers websites for ""remaindered books."",
Develop a relationship with a book store or book seller.,
Read book award lists to find possible acquisitions.,
Go to a large public library and peruse their reference section.,
Buy a book repair guide, such as ""A Simple Book Repair Manual"" by Dartmouth College.",How to Set Up Your Own Reference Library2," Choose 1 that is extensive, such as a version of the Oxford English Dictionary. This may be the most expensive acquisition at the beginning of your reference library, because it is necessary for research.

, These should also be fairly new because countries and cities change regularly. Collect detailed atlases of any specific areas you plan to study.

, Public and school libraries must regularly update their collections in order to stay current. You can get the last edition of many common library books for a low price, because they may be sold for a few dollars a piece.

, You may be able to get a full collection for less, if you research bulk book sales on the Internet or through local estate sales.


You can also choose to invest in an online encyclopedia that you store on a disk, on your library computer hard drive, or on the Internet. Popular encyclopedias like Encyclopedia Britannica offer online subscriptions to their content.

, You can find discount subscriptions of many publications on the Internet. National Geographic, Scientific American or the Smithsonian include articles that are valuable to a reference library.


If you do not have room to store these magazines, then opt for an online subscription to their archives.

, These are part of a complete reference library. Visit your local library and make photocopies to develop your collection.

, This is a great place to look for primary sources, such as journals. Pay extra attention to editions, modifications and the fragility of the book.

, Often these books are not selling quickly enough, so the publisher sells them at a deep discount to make space in the warehouse. Non-fiction books are often remaindered by publishers.

, They can keep you up to date about new reference book editions or rare books.

, Most genres have a yearly award, such as the Pulitzer Price for History, the George Washington Book Prize or the Phi Beta Kappa Award in Science.

, Make a list of books you want to acquire and place them on your acquisition schedule. Ask them how often they replace the books, in case you can get them at library sales.

, They can instruct you on how to condition leather, repair spines and more. This can save you from needing to ship a book to a professional book binder.

"
"
Organize your books by subject.,
Record your library electronically as you acquire books.,
Use acid-free bookplates or a library stamp on each book, if you plan to allow lending.,
Stack large and heavy books horizontally.",How to Set Up Your Own Reference Library3," Unlike a fiction library, searching by author is difficult because many reference books are written by more than 1 person. Research the Dewey Decimal system, the Library of Congress System, or reserve a shelf for each subject.

, There are a number of programs that are made for this function and offer you the ability to search by subject, author, bar code and more.


Electronic databases allow you to create your own card catalog. Good programs include LibraryThing, GuruLib, BookCAT, Reader2 and Shelfari. Some programs have both a free and a paid option. The free account may allow you to catalog a few hundred items, but you would need a paid account to add more.
If you own an Apple computer, then Delicious Monster may be the best program for you. It includes a bar code scanning process and a media cataloging function.

, Many online stamp makers provide personalized library stamps.

, Lay them flat to avoid excess damage to the spines. Place other books 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the back of the shelves for better air circulation.

"
"
Keep the temperature of your library between 60 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit (16 to 21 degrees Celsius).,
Dust the tops and spines of the books regularly.,
Look out for infestations of silverfish, cockroaches, bookworms and book lice.",How to Set Up Your Own Reference Library4," You should also aim to keep the books in an environment that is not too humid or too dry to discourage mold, fungus and infestation. Use a dehumidifier in the summer and a humidifier in the winter to keep books from molding or drying out.

, As well as an aesthetic problem, dust attracts moisture, mildew and book lice.

, Many of these animals are attracted to dust, glue and paper. They eat through the books, spines and often leave their waste on the pages. If you find an infestation, consult a professional exterminator before they destroy too many books.


If you believe the pest problem only extends to 1 or 2 books, place each 1 in a plastic freezer bag. Remove as much air as possible and seal it well. Leave them in the freezer for a day to kill the insects. Then clean out the book as thoroughly as possible.

Follow the bookmobile library’s borrowing procedures.Like any library, a bookmobile library has certain requirements and rules regarding the borrowing of materials.,
Pay off any fines.",How to Use a Bookmobile Library," Most bookmobiles are part of a larger library district. As such, many bookmobiles only require patrons to have a library card to their parent district. Other bookmobiles may require patrons to have a special card before being permitted to use the bookmobile library, even if they are attached to larger districts. Find out if you have a working library card or if you need to apply for a new one before you do anything else.;
, For most bookmobiles, the service is free to residents who live within the area of the bookmobile’s parent library district. Some bookmobile libraries are closed to people living outside of this region, but others will allow citizens from neighboring cities or counties to take advantage of the bookmobile service for a small fee. If your library district does not have its own bookmobile, find out if a neighboring one does and if you can obtain access.

, The typical bookmobile library makes a range of stops. These stops often include neighborhood stops, nursing homes, and daycare centers. Some bookmobiles accept suggestions for new stops, while others determine their stops without community input.

, Before you can use the bookmobile, you need to know where to find it and when. Most bookmobile libraries will put out a yearly, bi-yearly, or quarterly schedule of bookmobile stops. You can usually obtain a copy of the bookmobile's schedule by asking the bookmobile workers, library workers from a branch in the district, or by accessing it online.

, Many bookmobile libraries are willing to take requests, but you may need to wait until the next schedule is drafted before it will be put into effect. Moreover, even bookmobiles that are willing to add a new stop or neighborhood to their route may have specific requirements. For instance, you may need to guarantee that a minimum number of books will be checked out each month or that road and traffic conditions can accommodate a bookmobile stop.

, Many bookmobile libraries are willing to provide a special service to individual patrons who are physically unable to visit one of the district's branches due to disabilities, age, illness, or loss of mobility. Depending on the circumstances and the bookmobile library's policies, these home-bound individuals might be able to arrange a brief visit from the bookmobile once or twice a month.

, Bookmobile libraries can carry thousands of titles that may include not only print books, but audio books, DVDs, videos, and compact discs, as well. Additionally, your library on wheels may have a selection of materials from many genres. The selection may be heavy in one area depending on whom the bookmobile caters to, though. For instance, bookmobiles primarily aimed at serving a day care may have a large selection of children's books, while bookmobiles mainly aimed at senior citizens may have a larger selection of large print books.

, Many libraries allow you to reserve books online or in person and are willing to send the reserved materials to your branch of choice. For library systems that have a bookmobile, the bookmobile may serve as one such choice.

,


Obey the check-out period. Oftentimes, the check-out period for bookmobile materials depends on how often the bookmobile comes around. If the bookmobile comes around once a month, for instance, then you may be allowed to keep the materials that long. In other cases, especially for bookmobiles that come around on a more frequent basis, the check-out periods may only be as long as they are for books and materials checked out from the library district as a whole.
Know the check-out limits. Since a bookmobile library has a limited supply of materials as compared to a standard library branch, the check-out limits may be a little more rigid. You will probably only be allowed to check out so many books, DVDs, compact discs, or other materials at once.
Learn about the renewal policy. Bookmobiles associated with parent library branches may allow you to renew bookmobile materials as long as the renewal happens before the check-out period expires. Not all bookmobile libraries will allow this, however, due to the limited supply of materials they carry.

, As with any library, keeping library materials past their due date will result in a fine. Pay fines as you get them. Strict bookmobiles may restrict you from borrowing further materials until your current fines are paid. Others may not restrict you immediately but will do so if too much time passes with unpaid fines.

You can just put in the word ""library"" and your town name in the search bar, and the local library branch should pop up.


There are even some websites that list all public libraries in a given country. If you want a list of all of the libraries in your state, go to one of these sites.;
, You will need to bring in some form of official identification, such as a passport or drivers license.You may also need to prove your address, which is usually done by bringing in a piece of official mail (a utility bill for instance) that has your name and address on it.If you are too young to have an official piece of identification, then you will most likely need to go to the library with an adult who has this type of identification. You can get your own library card, but the adult will need to vouch for you.
Some libraries want you to fill out a form online, and then go in to a branch to show your identification and pick up your card. This is why it is a good idea to check online about the application process before going into the library.

, Bring your identification documents with you to the library. Be sure to check that the library is open before trying to go there. Some libraries are open at unexpected times, so double check online for hours and days open., Once at the library, find a person who works there to ask about library accounts. In many cases, you will want to go up to a desk that has a sign that says something like, ""New Accounts.""


If it is unclear where to go once you enter the library, feel free to ask any employee you see about getting a library card. At the very least, that employee should be able to steer you towards a person who can actually help you.

, This should be a common request at the library, so the employee should understand what you are asking for. They will then walk you through the process and review the documents that you brought with you.

, This process will vary drastically from library to library. Some libraries will ask you to fill out a form, while at others you will just give your identification to an employee and they will put your information straight into a computer.


Whatever information your library requires, such as your address or date of birth, provide it if the request seems reasonable and you are comfortable giving the information.

, Depending on your specific library, you may get your card right away or it may be sent to you. When you get it, sign it to make it official. You now have access to all the amazing resources provided by your local library.


When you come to the library, remember to bring your library card so you can check items out.

, If you're not used to borrowing books from the library, take out one at a time. Then, as you grow more comfortable and you return your books on time, you can get a few out at a time.


Most libraries have a limit on the number of items you can have out at one time. Ask your librarian how many items you can have out at your specific library., The librarians in your library are a really great resource for you. They can give you all kinds of information, such as recommending good books on your specific interests or helping you research topics you find interesting., The more you visit, the more enjoyable it can become. The library can be a wonderful space where you can learn new things and where you have free access to a wide variety of ideas from all over the world. They are a valuable resource that you can use any time they are open.Explore your local library. Peruse the stacks of books and learn where different types of books are housed. This may lead to you finding books on a topic you didn't even know you were interested in.

All of the works written by the author that the library has available will be listed.In addition to books, newspaper articles, conferences, and other books associated with the author will be listed. You can narrow down the search results by filtering the list. Filter the results by clicking on books.
You can also use this method if you are interested in other books by a specific author. Type in the author’s name and look through the books that come up in the search engine.

, Do this if you do not have a specific book or author in mind, but you are interested in a particular subject. When searching by subject, use key words to narrow down your search.For example, if you are interested in immigration, then type in the search box “U.S. immigration,” “European immigration,” or “Mexican immigrants.”

, Do this once you have found a book. You will be redirected to a new page that contains specific information about your book, like the book’s status and where it is located. To access this information, you may need to input an ID and password if you are at a private library, like a university library. If you are a student of the university or member of the library, then input your information.If you are at a public library, then you may not need to input an ID and password. If you do, then ask the librarian for this information.

, These are the three most important pieces of information that you need to write down. This information tells you where the book is located in the library and if it is available.For example, write down, location: Anderson Library Stacks, call number: QA 600.K57 2009, and status: available/unavailable.
If your book is located in the “stacks,"" then it is a circulating book that can be checked out for a certain period of time like four weeks.
If your book is in the “reserves,” a reference book, or in the “special collections,” then it can be checked out, however, it cannot be taken outside of the library.

, Do this if your book is available (not checked out or missing). Identify the first two letters of the call number. Then find them on the guide. The guide will tell you which wing of the library the book is in and on what floor.For example, a book starting with QA may be in the blue wing on the fourth floor.
Look for call number guides around the computers, or at the library's main desk.

, Do this if you are unsure where the blue wing is, for example. You can find maps at the main desk of the library. The map will outline how to get to the different wings of the library, using the main desk as the reference point.Alternatively, you can ask a staff member to direct you to the wing.

, The bookshelf labels are organized alphabetically. Use these labels to locate which bookshelf your book is on. The labels typically contain a range of letters and numbers, for example, QA 100.74.B50 to QA 300.70.A30. If your book’s call number falls within the range, then begin looking through that bookshelf.For example, if your book’s call number is QA 200.86.S50, then it falls within the range and your book is located on that shelf.

, The books are also organized alphabetically, so use the call number to locate the book. The call number is typically located at the bottom of the book’s spine. The book's call number should match the call number in the system identically.Since books are organized by topic using the Library of Congress Classification System, try browsing the other books in the section you found your book in if you want more books on your topic.

, Do this if you cannot find the book, but the system says it is available. The book may be misplaced, or perhaps you are looking in the wrong place. After all, most libraries are huge and it is easy to get confused. The staff member will go and look for the book for you.Tell the staff member, “I went to look for a book in the blue wing, but I could not find it. The system said it was available, but it was not there when I went to go look for it. Could you check for me?”

, If the librarian confirms that the book is missing or unavailable, then request an interlibrary loan. You or the librarian will need to fill out a request form detailing the name of the book, author and year it was published, as well as your contact information. It usually takes five to seven days for a book to arrive.An interlibrary loan allows you to check out a book from another library where the book is available.

Remove all furniture, movable shelves and books from your nook.,
Decide on a color scheme for your nook and paint the walls or shelves.,
Buy book shelves if you don't have any.",How to Turn a Nook Into a Home Library1," Give the area a deep cleaning with soap and water. This can serve as preparation before you paint or as a way to protect your books from dust, sunlight or insect damage.;
, If the rest of your house has white walls, you may choose to leave the area white. However, some nooks benefit from having soothing colors, such as earth tones or pastels, on the walls and book shelves.


If you are renting your house or apartment, you should not paint your walls. However, you can paint your book shelves to add color to the area. Make sure all shelves cure for 1 to 2 weeks before you put books on them, so that wet paint doesn't ruin your collection.

, Estimate how many books you will have in your library and count how many books your shelves can hold. Not all the shelves need to be large or built in, because you can find many freestanding book shelves that allow you to stack books in tight spaces or on the walls themselves.


Make sure to choose bookshelves that either have adjustable shelf height or that have shelves of varying heights. Many reference books are taller than normal shelves.

Decorate a child's reading nook with bright colors, a comfortable rug, stuffed animals, comfortable chairs and low book shelves.",How to Turn a Nook Into a Home Library2," Decorate any open wall space with art. You can choose a print or poster with a literary influence, but it should be a calming or thought-provoking image.

, Many people choose alphabetizing by author, but you can also choose to stack books by color or subject matter. Place the books on your shelves, about an inch away from the back of the shelf, so the books can be kept dry through ventilation.

, Most people need a comfortable chair, such as a small sofa, recliner, chaise lounge or plush chair. Also, consider setting up a desk for research, an ottoman, baskets or boxes for magazines and a small table to keep drinks away from the book shelves.

, Natural light should not stream directly onto your books, or they will be damaged by sunlight. Hang a pendant lamp that casts light directly from above or choose a standing lamp that reaches throughout the whole nook.


Place light-filtering shades over windows that direct light onto your books. If possible, place your books so that sunlight isn't cast directly onto them.

, Insects can damage books, so you want to put any plants on the outskirts of your nook, and check regularly for infestations. Water the plants in the sink so they don't ruin furniture.

, Keep this area separate from televisions and other stimuli that could disrupt your child from reading.

If you find an infestation in your books, you can place your books in a sealed plastic bag and stick them in the freezer to kill the insects.

, If that is not possible, you can use an air conditioner or a dehumidifier to control the moisture in the air.

, Try to keep your books organized according to your chosen filing system. Keep track of books that are borrowed in a small register on your library desk or table.

If you're younger than that, ask an older sibling, parent, guardian, or baby sitter to take you. Find the circulation desk (sometimes called the front desk), and tell the librarian that you would like a library card. To get your card, you or your guardian will have to provide:Your name
Your address (they need to make sure you live in the area)
Your phone number
The names of other people you want on the account (they’ll get their own card that’s linked to your account)
Photo identification with your name and address on it;
, Books in libraries are often organized by genre, which means a particular style or type. This means, for instance, that all the mystery books will be grouped together, and all the science books will be together, and all the cooking books will be together.


Within these sections, books will also be organized alphabetically by the last names of the authors.
To find books, you can browse through the different sections until you find something that catches your eye, or until you find what you’re looking for.
You can also use the library’s computer to look through the catalogue and locate specific books or books about a particular subject.The computer will tell you what section the book is in.
When in doubt, you can always ask the librarian where you can find certain books, particular authors, or specific genres.

, Some libraries have limits on how many books you can check out at a time, and others also limit the number of books you can take out on a certain subject at one time.


While you may be able to take out a large number of books at any given time, you may be limited when it comes to checking out multiple DVDs, CDs, magazines, and other materials.

, When you’ve looked through and decided on the books you want to take home, take them to the circulation desk. Most modern libraries will have two options: either take your books right to the desk for the librarian to check out, or take them to the nearby self-checkout machine. To have the librarian check out your books:


When it’s your turn, go up to the desk and place your books and your card on the desk. Always have your library card when you're taking out books.
The librarian will scan your card, scan the books, tell you your due date, and run the book through a machine so it doesn’t set off the alarm. The librarian may also give you a slip of paper that says your due date on it. Try not to lose this!
If you're going away on a family holiday and need the book for longer, ask about being able to keep the book for longer., Instead of waiting in line at the circulation desk, you can also check out books yourself using the self-checkout machine, if your library has one. These machines will often be close to the circulation desk, but you will have to be tall enough to reach the touch screen or button.Tap the button on the screen or use the laser on the machine to scan the barcode on your library card.
When the machine tells you to, scan the barcode on your first book. Make sure you scan the library bar code on the front cover or inside cover, and not the publisher’s barcode on the back.
To turn off the alarm device in the book, place the spine of the book into the reader and wait until the screen prompts you to remove it.

, These days, many libraries have online sites you can use to renew books, place holds, check out e-books, add books to a list of ones you want to read, see your borrowing history, and browse the library’s catalogue.When you're at the library checking out your books, ask if the library has an online portal where you can access your account online. Ask the librarian to write down the website and the information you'll need to make an account.
If you can use the computer on your own, go ahead and set up your account at a time when you're allowed to be on the computer. Otherwise, ask a parent, teacher, or older sibling to help you out.

, Libraries allow borrowers to extend the amount of time they can keep a book through the renewal process. Usually you can renew a book two or three times, as long as it’s not a brand new book and as long as nobody else has placed a hold on it. You can renew by:Logging in to the online site. Find the book in your list, select the box beside it, and click Renew.
Calling the library. Be sure to have your library card number handy and the name of the book.
Visiting the circulation desk directly. Again, be sure to have your library card with you.

, Sometimes a book you want to check out won’t be available, and this is usually because somebody else already has it checked out. When this happens, you can place a hold on the book to ensure that when the book is returned, it will be held for you.Like renewals, most libraries allow you to place holds in person or through the portal. If you're on the portal, find the book you want to borrow and look for the Place a Hold option.

, To borrow e-books from libraries, you need access to your own or a parent’s mobile device, like an e-reader or tablet. If you aren't allowed to do this on your own, ask if a parent or guardian will download Overdrive onto the device.Go to the applications store on your mobile device, such as the App Store, Amazon Appstore, or Google Play, and search for Overdrive. When you find it, select Install.
Overdrive is like an online bookshelf that links public library accounts to e-reader and mobile device accounts.
Once the app is installed, launch it so you can put in your information and find your local library from the dropdown menu., From a desktop computer or with the browser on your mobile device, log in to your library’s online portal using your account information. Browse through until you find an e-book you want to borrow.

, To do this, find the title of the book and the link that says Borrow or Download. Once you’ve done this, it will ask you for the delivery method. You may need to select the type of device (such as a Kindle) or the specific app you're using (such as Overdrive).If prompted, select Checkout to initiate the transfer to your Overdrive account.

, If the device you want to use to read your e-book isn't connected to a network, connect it to Wi-Fi so it can receive the e-book. If you're using an Amazon device, you will need to sign in to your Amazon account to receive the transfer and download the book.If you're using a mobile phone or tablet to read your book, log on to your library account from the device, and then select download to Overdrive. Make sure you already have Overdrive installed on your device to open the book.

, Materials that you can take out from the library, including books, magazines, and DVDs, always have a due date, which is the date by which your items are due back to the library. This allows other people to check out and enjoy the materials as well.


Libraries have individual policies about loan periods, and different items usually have different loan periods as well. For instance, whereas you may be able to keep a book for 14 to 21 days, you may have to return a DVD after seven days. If you lose the slip of paper that tells you when your materials are due back, you can either call the library to ask, drop by the circulation desk to find out, or check in to your online account, which will give you a list of the materials you have checked out and their due dates.

, Sometimes books are recalled, which means you have to bring the book back sooner. If this happens, you will usually receive a notification by email or phone., When you do this, you return books directly to a library staff member. This method is good if you want to say hi and chat, or if you want the books returned right away so that you can take out more.


Some larger libraries have check-in/check-out desks and help desks where you may be able to return books as well.

, Many libraries have drop boxes that can be used to return books. For most libraries, there will be a drop box inside at the circulation desk, and there will also be one outside so that you can still return books after the library is closed.


Simply open the door to the box (for external boxes), place your books inside the compartment, and close the door again to drop your books into the box.

, E-books are generally returned automatically when they are due, but if you have an e-reader and want to return the item early, go to Manage Your Content, then find the title you want to return. Select Actions beside the title, then Return, then Yes."

Understand that library books are often more expensive than privately bought books.,
Inquire where the library buys their books.,
Ask the publishing company if they can send the library the book before receiving payment.,
Buy the books that fit within your library's criteria.",How to Buy Books for the Library," Many libraries subscribe to lists that automatically send them books from certain publishers. You will want to avoid doubling up on books, or buying something that the library doesn't need.;
, Many libraries make the majority of their acquisitions at the beginning of their fiscal year. This is a good time to buy books, if you are part of library staff, but if you want to donate, you may want to help out later in the year.


Ask if the library needs a purchase order for every book it purchases. Many libraries are publicly funded, and a purchase order, or PO, helps them keep track of their budget.

, Friends of the Library is a common non-profit organization that helps to support library collections and presentations. They often have a fund to help the library receive books or collections they need most.

, Most libraries put an emphasis on acquiring very new books; however, they may also be in need of replacements for lost or stolen copies.

, Most libraries prefer library-bound or hardcover books because they stand up to more circulation than paperback books.


Library bound books are bound with extra stitching and a hardcover, but are often less decorative than the original covers. Most library bindings are made through a special service, although some publishers have started to provide library bindings.

, Libraries aim to keep copies of new books on hand for patron use, so they often pay the full price from the publisher. Library binding also adds money onto the process, which the library hopes will add value with further readings. Few new releases are acquired for less than $25 (18 euros, 16 pounds).

, Book stores and even Amazon.com often give a discount to libraries and schools.

Some small to mid-sized libraries have Amazon accounts that receive an extra discount. If you go onto this site, you can buy books from their wish list.

, Unlike other book purchases, sometimes payment is required within 30 days of receipt of the books. This allows the library to put it into the system.

, If the book is not library bound, ask if you should arrange for a library binding to complete your library book purchase.

To start, apply a basic primer and foundation. This will lay the groundwork for the make-up that follows.


If you're going to a party or convention dressed as Katniss, keep in mind you'll want your make-up to last for awhile. Try using heavy amounts of foundation and primer to keep your make-up solid.Find a type of primer and foundation that matches your skin tone. You might have to try a few different shades until you find one that matches. Apply the primer first. You can use a make-up brush or sponge. If you use a sponge, use a gentle dabbing motion. You can also simply use your fingers. If you do choose to use your hands, however, wash your hands thoroughly first and you do not want to expose your skin to bacteria. When you finish applying the primer, add a layer of foundation across your face.
When you're done, your face should look smooth and your skin tone should look even. From here, you can apply your other make-up.;
, In the movie, Katniss seems to have very defined eyebrows. Therefore, you should look into altering your eyebrows to match.


In the film, Katniss's eyebrows do not have much of an arch. You can use concealer to create a flatter, thinner effect if your eyebrows don't match her appearance.If you're having difficulty getting your eyebrows right with make-up, consider shaving them off and then drawing them on with a brow brush., Once you've done your eyebrows, move on to a basic bronzer. Pick the shade that best matches your skin tone. From there, bronze your cheekbones, the bridge of your nose, and gently outline your face in bronzer. You should use a make-up brush to apply bronzer. Blend the bronzer into your other make-up using your fingers if you see make-up lines. Once again, wash your hands first., Eye liner is important to the Katniss Everdeen look. Katniss does not wear much make-up in the books or movie. She seems to rely on mostly natural beauty unless she's at a ball or chariot scene. Therefore, basic foundational eye liner is your best option for portraying Katniss.


Use a black eye-liner, as it seems to be Katniss's choice in the movies and books. Simply outline your eye using the pencil or brush. Focus first on your eyelid, drawing a thin black line just underneath your bottom eyelashes. There's no need to draw a thick line, as Katniss does not wear much make-up. Just add the eye-liner necessary to highlight your natural beauty.When you finish with the lower lid, move on to the upper lid. Draw a thin line on your eye lid, just above your eyelid. Once again, a thin line is best as you're just trying to highlight your natural looks.If you slip up when applying eye liner, you can always use baby wipes to dab off any smearing. If you don't have baby wipes, just wet a paper towel or tissue and add a small bit of soap. Work slowly to avoid getting soap in your eyes.

, If you're doing a battle scene, you might want to pick an eye shadow that matches your regular skin tone. Neutral shades like browns, peaches, and tans are your best option if you're doing battle-ready Katniss. Apply slowly with a make-up brush and blend excess make-up into your existing foundation and bronzer. As with the eye shadow, the aim here is to highlight your natural beauty so you don't want to look like you're wearing a lot of make-up.

, However, in some scenes Katniss has more dramatic eye make-up. In chariot scenes, and when she's performing, her eye make-up is generally very defined. If you're portraying Katniss from one of these scenes, you can try a smokey eye or make a design using your eye shadow.


To do chariot scene make-up, use eye-liner to outline a curved shape around your eye. Add little tipped arches on the edge of each eye, pointing outwards towards your temples. Fill this space in with black eye shadow. Then, take the black eye liner again. Draw small gold wings stemming from the bend of the tipped arches. Fill in the outlined wings with gold eye shadow.If this feels too elaborate, consider a basic smokey eye. Katniss wears this a lot in scenes where she's dressed up. A smokey eye is made using various shades of gray and black eye shadow. Apply lighter shades of gray around the inner corners of your eye, swiping upwards slightly. Then, use your darkest shade to fill in the remainder of your eyelid., Once you've done the rest of your make-up, start working on your lashes. Depending on how dramatic you want your look, you can use mascara or purchase fake eyelashes from a make up or department store<A light coat of basic mascara is best if you're doing a battle scene Katniss. The goal here is to make your make-up less noticeable, so simply go over your eye lashes once with regular mascara.
If you're doing a chariot or performance scene, consider fake eyelashes. You can purchase fake eyelashes at a department or grocery store. The container should provide instructions on how to put the eyelashes on.

, Katniss wears her hair in a french braid for much of the movie. If you want to look like Katniss, the first thing you'll want to do is work on braiding your hair appropriately. To start, grab a chunk of your hair. From there, separate this chunk into three smaller chunks, roughly equal in size., Once you have your hair ready, begin the process of french braiding. French braiding can be tricky, so if you're new to it consider having someone help. If you're unsure of the process, there are many videos online that walk you through how to french braid.


For simplicity's sake, let's refer to your chunks of hair as group 1, 2, and 3. To start, take group 1 and pull it under group 2.Then, take group 3. Dip it below both group 1 and group 2.Add a small amount of your remaining hair into group 2. Then, bring group 2 under group 3.Add hair to group 1 and then bring group 1 under your braid., Continue all the way down your hair and pull it tightly so it remains in place. Continue to add hair to the different groups, tucking them under the braided group as you go. Do this until you reach the end of your hair. Pull your hair tightly and, if necessary, wrap the end in a rubber band. This will help your hair stay in place., For much of the movie, Katniss wears knee-high black boots. Consider buying a pair of your own if you want to look like Katniss. You should also look into lace-up boots, as these are the type Katniss is most often seen wearing.If you're unsure of your shoe size, you can measure your size when you go to the shoe store. Make sure you take time to walk around in any boots before purchasing them. Your toes should have some wiggle room and the boots should be comfortable, especially if you'll be walking around a lot.

, If you're going to be portraying Katniss in jeans, choose the right kind. Look into black jeans, as Katniss is frequently seen in black. If you plan on wearing jeans with boots, consider bootcut jeans or at least jeans than can be easily stretched or tucked into your boot.Keep in mind sizes often vary in women's jeans. If you're getting skinny jeans or a different cut than normal, your size may be smaller or bigger depending on your body frame. Always try jeans on in the store before making a purchase.

, If Katniss is going into battle, she is frequently portrayed in black. She often wears a black leather vest over a black shirt. Consider this basic ensemble to aid in your Katniss costume., In many movie scenes, especially when Katniss is on TV, she is portrayed in elaborate, sparkly dresses. Make a trip to your favorite store and look into purchasing sparkly, fun outfits for your Katniss costume.Katniss is usually styled professionally before chariot and performance scenes. Therefore, go for a higher quality dress if you can afford one.
Katniss's dresses are rarely simple. Even if you would not normally wear a flashy dress, make an exception if you want to portray Katniss.

Make a schedule if you are reading the book to write a report on it.,

Take every opportunity to read that you have.",How to Read a Whole Harry Potter Book in a Week," The longest Harry Potter book is more than 850 pages, so spread out the number of pages throughout the 7 days.


For a huge Harry Potter book, try reading between 100-150 pages a day.






The first two Harry Potter books are about 300-400 pages, so try reading 50-100 pages per day. The Harry Potter books can be very enjoyable. Before you know it, you'll be all done with your self-assigned reading. If the number of pages just seems like too many, try dividing the number of chapters, instead. You will be doing the same amount of reading, but it will seem less intimidating.





;
, The Harry Potter books don't have a lot of difficult words in them, but if you come across a word you do not understand or know, highlight or write it down and look it up in the dictionary.

, You don't want to speed through a Harry Potter book and miss all the good, juicy material do you? Harry Potter is not very complicated to read, so don't fret. Just as in Step 1, make a reading schedule, but either read more pages each subsequent day, or read for less time to cover the same number of pages.

, This is probably the easiest method, especially for all you Harry Potter fans out there! Get all your chores, homework, or whatever you need to get done first before you start reading so you won't have any distractions or a self-nag in the back of your mind telling you to do what you have to.

, Distractions like noises, interruptions, and household activities will slow you down.

, If you have a place to prop your feet, that is even better.

, If the weather is nice, and there is a quiet space in your yard or park, you can find a shady spot to sit and read, and pass a whole afternoon with the characters in your book. If you are reading indoors, make sure you have lots of light. Some people suggest fluorescent lights, since the light is easier on your eyes.

, Some people will read through the whole book in a few hours, and that is fine, but you should pick your own speed, and read without putting pressure on yourself to finish.

, If you have a wait for the bus, a free period at school, or some other time when you get a chance, have the book with you, and dive in. Even if you only have a few minutes, you will read some pages, and if you have a long wait, the time will seem like it flew by.

"
Create your Character.,
Start by writing your character's full name and their feelings about their name.,
Name your character.,
What house will your character be in?,
Write your character's best friend(s) names and five words or more - you can do however many you like - describing them-not physically, but what they are like.,
Write your character's enemy or enemies.,
Write many other things about your character as well.,
Draw a picture of your character.,
Determine your character's boggart.,
Determine your character's wand.,
Every witch/wizard has a pet at Hogwarts.,
Pick the school your character goes to,The most common one is Hogwarts.,
Determine your character's special abilities or features.",How to Create Your Own Harry Potter Character," To create your own Harry Potter character, you really need to know your character. If you know him/her like the back of your hand, there character will come to life in your story and really make it a whole lot better. So, to start off with learning the inside out of your character, simply get to your computer and open a new word document.;
, (You can write how they got their name and what that name means.)

, Next, write all of your character's family's full names. Grandparents, cousins, uncles, aunts, sisters, brothers, parents, everyone. (You can write your main character's feelings about all of her family and what they are like.)

, If you want you can go online and look up the sorting hat quiz. Answer all the questions the way that your character would. Then submit, and see what house your character would be in. Be sure when you draw your character to make them look like a person from their house. For example if your character is a Ravenclaw draw their school uniform to be a Ravenclaw.

, (You can describe their physical traits if you like.)

, Do the same thing you did for your character's friends and make sure to write why your character and this/these person/s are enemies. If your character is in any house other than Slytherin, you might want to make their enemy or enemies a certain Slytherin or all Slytherins.

, You can write things like how they appear like, their customs, their family's traditions, their neighbors and their neighborhood; basically every little thing about your character.

, You should draw your character or find a picture online that you think describes your character. The drawing doesn't have to be the best, it's only for you to see what your character looks like. This might seem like a lot of things to do for one character, but if your character is interesting-which is necessary for a good story-then making up all of these things about your character will be fun. --

, What is their biggest fear?

, Shorter wands generally go for shorter people, or whose character is 'somewhat lacking', and less flexible wands go for wizards with less adaptability. Go to Pottermore to read about wand woods and cores.

, You can a pick a toad, cat or an owl. If your character is in the Ravenclaw house or Hufflepuff house, it will prefer a cat. If your character is poor, it'll have a toad. Something common would be an owl., Students in Beauxbatons and Durmstrang can also be male or female., Is she a Parseltongue? Is he an expert on non verbal magic? Try adding things like this to make your wizard truly unique.

Ask your librarian for titles he/she recommends that are fantasy or like Harry Potter.,
Ask a friend if they or their child has read the Potter series.,
Look for fantasy novellas.,
Join a book sharing site, like Movella and Wattpad, and find suitable books for your child to read.,
See if any fantasy book clubs are open for members.,
Read a rival book series, and then choose your favorite book/let your child choose their favorite book from the rival series and Harry Potter.,
Be on the lookout for books by J. K. Rowling.",How to Choose Kids Books for Harry Potter Fans," You never know what your librarian can help you find. A public librarian or a school librarian could help you. Give them to the child and see if they like them. If they don't, then ask them why they didn't like them and try again, trying to avoid the books that the child has said that they don't like.;
, If so, they can be a big help in finding something else for a Harry Potter fan to read. Make sure that their child is around the same age as your child/they are around the same age as you, so you read books around the same difficulty.

, There are lots of them, but voracious readers can be picky about their books, so put some thought into it. Some good books to try for 8-13 year olds are:


Whispering to Witches -Anna Dale
Pure Dead series -Debi Gliori
Molly Moon series- (younger end of the scale) Georgia Byng
Inkheart Trilogy- Cornelia Funke
His Dark Materials series- (older end of the scale, for keen readers) Philip Pullman
For older readers (13+) try the Mortal Instruments series (Cassandra Clare) or the Twilight Saga (Stephanie Meyer). However, keep in mind that there are some parts of the books in these series that are inappropriate for readers in the younger end of the scale.

, Keep in mind that these books have been written by non-authors and some are not quite suitable for young children.

, These clubs read books like Harry Potter and can be a lot of fun! They can also recommend good books for your child to read. If there are no clubs in your area, join online forums on book review sites like GoodReads to ask about good books for your child to read.

, You can try Percy Jackson and the Olympians (the main competition).

, Be aware that her adult book, 'The Casual Vacancy', could be considered inappropriate for young children. Try her Harry Potter linked books, 'The Tales Of Beedle The Bard' and 'Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them' instead.

Value intelligence above all.,
Pursue your interests.,
Embrace the unknown.,
Prioritize the future.,
Do well in school.,
Create!",How to Act Like a Ravenclaw1," One of the defining characteristics of Ravenclaw members–if not the defining characteristic–is their love of acquiring new knowledge.Expand your understanding of the natural (and supernatural) world. Watch documentaries. Read non-fiction books and online content. Increase your vocabulary with a Word of the Day calendar. Make a point each day of learning something that you didn’t know the day before.;
, One of the best ways to fall in love with learning is by studying things that already intrigue you, whether it is school-related or not. If you like to read, go to the library every chance you get. If you love to write, carry your notebook everywhere. If you like outer space, go to space camp! Stoke your desire to learn by seizing every opportunity to increase your knowledge and know-how about topics and interests that you hold dear.


You don't necessarily have to become the top expert or practitioner in your chosen field of study. Consider Sybil Trelawney, whose inability to make more than one or two accurate prophecies did not dissuade her from pursuing a thorough knowledge of the art.

, Never be content with what has already been studied, defined, and proven. Tackle new subjects that promise to be difficult in order to expand your overall knowledge. Challenge accepted views from authoritative sources by always asking, “Why?” Aim to not only collect well established facts and concepts, but to discover brand new info so you can contribute to everyone’s understanding of the world., Although Ravenclaws love to learn, their obsession with the unknown can make researching the past boring since there is less opportunity for new discoveries. So when you study subjects like history, focus on how past events have shaped the modern world–and how they may continue to shape tomorrow–to make things more interesting and immediate. Glean those tidbits of knowledge that can be applied directly to the here and now (and beyond!).For instance, learning ancient runes may seem like a waste of time if all you ever do with that skill is read original texts that have already been translated. But if you happen to unearth a previously undiscovered text containing long forgotten spells, that skill will suddenly come in very handy!

, Even though Ravenclaws love to gain knowledge, gaining knowledge doesn’t automatically equate to getting good grades.But remember: Ravenclaws are forward-thinking, so strategize! Even if you feel a particular class is dull or pointless (like, say, phys ed), think about the future. Strive for good grades to improve your overall average. Increase your eligibility for gifted and talented programs, advanced placement, and the college of your choice, where your intellect will be challenged much more than it may be at present!

, Ravenclaws love applying knowledge as much as acquiring it.Use what you have learned to develop something that is totally new. If you devour literature, write your own stories and poems. If you are fascinated by technology, build your own gadgets. If you love solving puzzles, construct your own for others to tackle. Whatever your skills and interests are, utilize them to produce brand new works!

Question yourself.,
Be open-minded.,
Think before you act.,
Stay true to yourself.,
Enjoy time alone.",How to Act Like a Ravenclaw2," Gain more confidence in your own judgments by constantly debating them. Reject the idea that something is “right” just because you happen to think so. Explore the merits and pitfalls of your moral beliefs. Reaffirm those that you still consider to be true after review. Reconsider those that now seem to have been founded more on impulse than sound reason., Never assume that you or anyone else knows EVERYTHING. If someone suggests a way of thinking that strikes you or your friends as too incredible to believe, give them the benefit of the doubt at first. Embrace new ideas or ways of life as a challenge for you to either accept or discount. Correct people when they are definitely wrong about something, but be sure to consider their argument from all angles before passing any judgment.The one exception would be when you are confronted by willful ignorance. Forgive people for simply being uninformed, but do not tolerate their refusal to accept what is undeniably true even after they have been presented with all the facts.

, Ravenclaws may be captivated by the unknown, but they sure hate being unprepared for it. When presented with a new situation, don’t just charge in like those Gryffindors. Consider all of your options before taking any action. Consider the possible consequences of each one and write pros-and-cons lists for them all. Then come up with a Plan A as well as a Plan B (and a Plan C, D, E …) to reduce the risk of having to act impulsively should the unforeseen happen.This aversion to leaping straight into action can sometimes lead to inaction or even cowardice if the chance of success appears especially slim, as best exemplified by Gilderoy Lockhart, who would rather hypothesize about all the heroic things that he would do in the face of danger, instead of actually doing them.

, Be an individual.Form your own opinions and theories. As long as they haven’t been outright disproven, be confident in your convictions. Rest assured that anyone who has thought about and cross-examined their own beliefs as much as a Ravenclaw does clearly doesn’t adopt opinions lightly, no matter how “crazy” other people might find them. Believe in UFOs, the Bermuda Triangle, Atlantis, telepathy, or whatever else is within the realm of possibility.


Luna Lovegood is a perfect example of a Ravenclaw who does what she likes and thinks what she thinks without letting anyone else dictate her beliefs.
Remember, though: Ravenclaws detest ignorance, so if something you believe in has been utterly disproven, accept it!

, Socialize when the mood strikes you, but value time spent apart from other people as well. Appreciate solitude as a chance to read, create, or contemplate without interruption. Content yourself with your inner life and achievements rather than put too much emphasis on surrounding yourself with others at all times."
"
Dress neatly.,
Be quirky.Show your individualistic streak by incorporating some unique element to your outfit.,
Wear house colors.,
Incorporate symbols.",How to Act Like a Ravenclaw3," Tuck in that shirt. Straighten your tie. Ravenclaw’s founder, Rowena Ravenclaw, was known for her beauty, and while not every Ravenclaw can hope to match hers, aspire to achieve an elegance in how you dress.Take pride in your appearance. Give yourself a glance in the mirror before heading out to make sure you don’t look sloppy or disheveled.


Contrast Harry Potter of Gryffindor to his brief love interest Cho Chang of Ravenclaw. Harry often looks like he rolled out of bed already wearing his robe and clothes, while Cho always seems to have taken the time to comb her hair and adjust her clothing so that she appears perfectly presentable time and time again.

, Whether you choose a striking accessory or clothing whose cut, color, or design sets it apart from the norm, set yourself apart from the crowd with a sense of fashion that is clearly your own and no one else’s. Keep it tasteful, though. Remember that Ravenclaws value elegance., Choose blue as your primary color for outfits, since this color is a constant for Ravenclaw in both books and films. If you are a purist, accent your outfits with bronze, which complements the color blue in the books. If you love the movies’ aesthetics, go with silver instead. Or be the open-minded Ravenclaw that you are and work with both silver and bronze!, Look for items that use the letter “R” as an emblem. Use the Ravenclaw Common Room’s ceiling as inspiration and pick clothing and/or jewelry that includes stars in their design.If you favor the books, look for items that feature an eagle, since this is Ravenclaw’s mascot in the original works. If you are a bigger fan of Ravenclaw’s mascot in the movies, go with ravens instead."

Use your Slytherin role model to become the best version of yourself.,
Avoid wizards associated with the Dark Arts.,

Mirror Hufflepuff loyalty.,
Imitate Gryffindor bravery.,
Respect all houses and all people.",How to Act Like a Slytherin," Ambition is a core characteristic of the Slytherin house. If you were sorted into Slytherin, then you likely have bright hopes for the future. Harness your natural motivation into action, and take steps towards your goals every day. Little achievements make for long-term success down the road.Don't burn yourself out working towards your goals. Sometimes Slytherins neglect self-care in pursuit of their interests.;
, Slytherins are naturally cunning and inquisitive about the world around them.If they think a certain subject will help them in their pursuits, they soak up knowledge like a sponge. Do something every day to expand your mind: complete a puzzle, read thought-provoking books, and question how the world works.

Work hard in school! Slytherins know that a good education is often the gateway to achieving their goals.

, Slytherins value order and tradition. Study the past, and research historical figures who made society what it is today. Honor their contributions by showing gratitude and preserving the good they did.

Although this may not come natural to Slytherins, don't be afraid to ask questions about tradition. Even things that have ""always been done"" aren't necessarily the best or right thing.

, Slytherins are the best house at self-preservation. In a dangerous situation, you want a Slytherin nearby to brainstorm a clever escape. When in a stressful situation, imagine the worst-case scenario and think of a solution. Practice quick-thinking skills to keep your mind sharp in case of emergencies.As impossible as a situation may seem, there is almost always a solution to bring you peace of mind.

, Look for Slytherins who have developed the best of their house traits. Perhaps you need to improve your ambition or gain greater respect for tradition. Look for characters who have whatever you're lacking.

Because the books are more detailed and offer a three-dimensional view of the characters, you might have better luck re-reading the series.

, Perhaps you're drawn to Severus Snape's sardonic wit, or Draco Malfoy's eventual good nature. Maybe your heart belongs to Regulus Black for his bravery in the face of danger. Whoever you pick as your role model, write down which traits of theirs you admire. Set goals to achieve those traits.

Not all Slytherins are evil, despite what some houses claim! Remember: the greatest wizard of all time (Merlin himself) was a Slytherin.Choose a role model who inspires you to overcome difficulty in your own life. You may not be fighting Dark Lords at Hogwarts, but you can use their example to face challenges in your own life., After you've narrowed down a Slytherin and why you admire them, work towards achieving that character trait. Suppose your favorite Harry Potter character is Draco Malfoy. Some traits of Draco Malfoy's are negative, like his rudeness and prejudice against others, but other traits are positive. He is, for example, a charismatic individual who cares for his family. Focus on developing his charisma but not his cruelty.

For example, maybe you want to be like Salazar Slytherin because of his cunning. You might read a new book every week and study hard to ace your classes. You might avoid mirroring Salazar Slytherin's prejudice against muggle-borns or people he doesn't understand.

, The point of having a role model is not to mimic that person entirely. Use your Slytherin role model to develop positive traits in your own way. You are not Snape, for example, but you can learn from his devotion to love and apply it to your own life. You can learn from Albus Potter's curiosity and natural intellect, but eventually you must become your own person.

Some people use role models as a way to hide from their insecurities. Avoid this temptation. If you're trying too hard to become your Slytherin role model, work on becoming comfortable in your own skin., Every Hogwarts house (even Gryffindor) has their fair share of dark wizards.Do not choose one as your role model, even if they have positive traits. Young Tom Riddle, for example, had admirable ambition but he had a cruel heart. Choose someone who used their Slytherin traits for good, instead.

If you ever feel like Slytherins have no positive traits, remember: Slytherins are resourceful, clever, ambitious, loyal (to those they care about), cerebral, and daring., Ravenclaws are curious souls who deeply value and respect wisdom.Intellect comes easy to Slytherin, but that is different from being wise: one is raw intelligence while the other is knowledge gained through experience. Channel your cunning into positive outlets, like schoolwork and personal passions, to turn your wit into wisdom like a Ravenclaw.

Pick a few Ravenclaw heroes to learn from, too: Luna Lovegood, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Filius Flitwick are all great choices., Hufflepuffs are compassionate and loyal to those they call friends. Given the right conditions, Slytherins can be fiercely loyal. To bring out this trait, observe the Hufflepuff's trusting nature and willingness to connect with others. Stay true to your friendships and protect those you love with your intelligence and ambition. A Hufflepuff's loyal nature can bring out the best in a Slytherin.

At first glance, Hufflepuffs and Slytherins may seem like water and oil. But both are passionate and hardworking: the difference is just how they reach their goals.
Look to notable Hufflepuffs for inspiration: Nymphadora Tonks, Newt Scamander, and Cedric Diggory are shining Hufflepuff role models., Traditionally, Gryffindors and Slytherins have not always been on good terms with each other. But a Slytherin's self-preservation pairs well with Gryffindor courage. Slytherins have the intelligence to protect themselves in times of danger while Gryffindors take great risks for those they love. If you can develop bravery like a Gryffindor, you can face almost any challenge with strength.

Remember the brightest and bravest of Gryffindor alumni: Hermione Granger, Albus Dumbledore, and Ron Weasley all make excellent inspirational figures.Try to overcome the inherent Slytherin bias against Gryffindor. When enemies, Slytherins and Gryffindors are formidable foes. But when they work together for the greater good, they can accomplish almost anything.

, Never insult or otherwise disrespect a friend who identifies with another house. All houses have positive traits, and no house is better than the rest. If everyone was a Slytherin, our world would be lacking in so many important character traits. Appreciate differences between people and houses, and never make someone feel less than you."

Gather the needed materials.,
Choose a suitable font.,
Start writing the letter.,
Print out the letter.,
Deliver the letter.,
You now know how to write a Harry Potter acceptance letter!

",How to Write a Harry Potter Acceptance Letter," These are listed below under ""Things You'll Need"".;
, The font needs to be realistic, one that would appear to come from Hogwarts. You can download such fonts online––just do a quick search for ""Harry Potter font"" and see what works for your operating system.


As well, look for a suitable image of the Hogwarts crest. This can also be found using an Internet search, then saving the image to your computer.

, If you don't know what to write, find a copy of the first book and copy out the letter or look for a copy of the text online. Use emerald green ink. The letter that came to Harry was written in emerald green ink on parchment paper.


Replace Harry's address with your friend's, and in place of ""the cupboard under the stairs"" put a description of their room, such as ""messy, messy room"" or ""corner with no windows"".

, You can also edit the envelope; it's recommended that you print the crest onto the envelope in the left hand top corner (or print the crest and glue it in place). Then, write your friend's address on the envelope. Make sure it is your best penmanship, or have someone with good handwriting write it. If you know calligraphy, now's the time to use it. Also add Hogwarts return address below the crest (or on the back of the envelope, which is more commonplace in Britain).


If you want, you can make the paper look old before you fold the letter and put it in an envelope. See How to make paper look old or How to age paper using tea for more ideas.

, Think of creative ways to deliver the letter. You could slip it in with a bundle of birthday cards, slip it into a friend's locker or have it dangling mid-air in a room.


One creative way is to make an origami owl. (You can find a clever design by searching ""origami owl bookmark"" and clicking on the result by Activity TV.) Put the letter in the owl's ""beak"", where you would normally put the page. Then you can put the owl in the witch/wizard's desk or backpack, etc.
Another way is, when you go to your friend's house, offer to grab the mail and secretly put the letter in the pile. If you're a good actor, then feign shock when you see the letter, or do an oblivious ""What's this for?"" and hand your friend the letter.
You can also just mail it to them using the postal service. It's less magical, but people love getting mail.

, Cross your fingers it says Gryffindor.

, Again, cross your fingers!

, It's a disgrace to Gryffindors everywhere. Most HP non-fans will spell it ""Griffendor"", ""Griffindoer"", or the common mistake, ""Griffindor"". Politely correct them, and for HP fans, add ""I thought you ought to know that.""

, Look him up on Wikipedia and the Harry Potter Wiki. You will find interesting facts which will help you on your way to Gryffindor life.

, You can substitute gold for yellow, but you may look half-Hufflepuff then. Yes, they're sweet, but we're talking Gryffindor here. Find scarlet and gold scarves, gloves, hats and shoes. Just use a black robe for your uniform, and for the finishing touch, add a Gryffindor badge (which you can find from the HP website) to your uniform.

, Since it's Hogwarts, most of the Gryffindors have a British accent, so try to practice that. Unless you're trying to be Seamus, in which case, speak like you're from Ireland. Use a few slang words

, Most Gryffindors are polite, dignified, and a bit modest. Have you seen Harry? Open doors for people, help old ladies cross the street. You may be a bit of a sissy, but that's better than being a bully.

, Most Gryffindors are brave (pardon Peter Pettigrew) and love adventure. Discover a plan from your school. See in advance which teacher your crazy old professor's going to marry. Dig for treasure. Discover a secret artifact. Anything's possible, as long as you think you can do it.

, (You can just think it if it might offend them.)


Ravenclaws: Smarties. People you get along well with. People who are a bit shy and bookish.
Hufflepuffs: Crazy, unexpected people. People with a love of cooking. Preferably a little bubbly around the waist.
Slytherins: People you can't really work with. Nope. People who you think are loony.
Snape: The professor you know who hates you,but has a soft spot deep,deep down for you.
Death Eaters: Natural enemies.
Voldemort: Your one and only mortal enemy.

, Add scarlet and gold/yellow beanbags, flags of Gryffindor (usually red and gold striped), red bedsheets, yellow cabinets, and an owl for the HP look.

, Keep repeating these steps until you are a true Gryffindor.

Ask the other person why he or she has not read the books or doesn't like them.,
If they just don't like them, perhaps because they find them boring, or maybe because they don't like all the Mary Sue type characters in the book (ex: Harry Potter, Dumbledore) or maybe they prefer other genres less focused on action, leave it at that.,
Explain to people who say the Harry Potter books are promoting satanism/witchcraft that they are all in good fun.,
Do not advertise your appreciation of Harry Potter if you run in many Christian/conservative circles.,
Don't assume that all Christian/religious people would love to see Harry Potter burnt at the stake.,
Ask people who had only watched the movies why they never read the books.,
Keep your cool.",How to Avoid Getting Into an Argument over Harry Potter," If the reason is the books are too long, suggest ways to read the book in portions or by chapter to make it seem shorter. Also, the books are available on tape and CD and listening to them can be a great way to pass time on car trips if someone doesn't have the time to sit and read the books. If they still say no, it's okay.;
, Not everyone has to like Harry Potter.

, Don't persist if they tell you to back off, as this could get you exactly what you're trying to avoid. Tell them that it is all make-believe and that it's not scary to you.

, Don't be untrue to yourself, but there's no need to bring it up on uncalled for situations. Many mistakenly consider an interest in Harry Potter to be an interest in 'the demonic' or 'witchcraft', and may have a lesser opinion of you if you seem obsessed with something they consider against their religion.

, Some will be very offended if you do.

, Relay to them that the books are actually easier to understand, and that they illustrate the entire story of Harry Potter instead of just the interesting parts that the movies portray. Also explain that reading will make you understand better and make you more intelligent.

, Don't try to shove the series down other people's throats if they're not prepared to swallow it. Not everyone can appreciate Harry Potter, or any book at that, controversial or not. Keep in mind that lots of books have had people completely for and completely against them, and that, in time, most haters learn to appreciate the works.

However, more detailed information will be available in the Twilight novels, written by author Stephenie Meyer. You might want to take notes on a blank sheet of paper to list notable characteristics of vampires in Twilight so you can imitate them more accurately.


You’ll likely find the extra details provided in the Twilight novels offer you a more complete understanding of vampires in the Twilight universe. To build the scene and tone in text, a novel cannot rely on images the same way film does. Because of this fact, extra information is included in the written novel to communicate a sense of depth, reality, and setting.
Jot down notes about the physical characteristics of vampires in the movies as well. Especially when it comes to makeup and the physical elements of style, like clothing and accessories, the movies will be one of your best resources. By watching the movies, you can see firsthand how expert costumers choose to visually portray the vampires in Twilight.
Borrow from the appearances of characters in the series. You may not want to look exactly like main character Edward Cullen, but you could attempt his windswept hairstyle in place of your own. You can pick and choose from the costumes of various characters to come up with a design completely unique to you.;
, This will be far easier than coming up with your own. Inventing your own character will require you to imagine various details, like motivation, backstory, personality, tastes, hobbies, and more. By choosing a character from the books to base your vampire identity around, you can get right into acting like a vampire without getting bogged down in creating one from scratch.As you play your character, you should start developing his/her backstory along with other details. This will allow you to identify with your false persona on a deeper level. Little by little, as you tailor your imaginary vampire persona to your vision, the character will become more “real” to you. This will make getting into your vampire persona easier.
While there are many characters throughout the series you might choose to base your vampire persona off of, a short list of noteworthy cast members includes: Bella Swan, Edward Cullen, Rosalie Hale, Emmett Cullen, Alice Cullen, Jasper Hale, Esme or Carlisle Cullen. You might even mix and match features from two different characters you adore to create your new vampire persona!, As a vampire, you’ve have plenty of time to master many skills, like sports, feats of dexterity, and precision tasks. And you’ll need to develop your skill in this area so you can pull off the most difficult moves while making it look easy. This way people will take you seriously when you say, “Ah, yes. I played much soccer when I was a young vampire. It’s been about 20 years since I played last, so I’m a little rusty.”


Spend some time honing your situational awareness. Vampires have supernatural senses, which mean they read their surrounding environment better and react faster to things in it. By improving your situational awareness, you will become more conscious of what’s happening around you, making it seem like you have supernatural senses like a vampire.
You should also have some hobbies that you’ve mastered in the hundreds of years you’ve lived as a vampire. You could actually master a hobby, like chess or painting, to lead people to believe you’ve had decades of practice, but this might be difficult. Feel free to get creative with your character to solve this problem. You might point to an elegant painting of art on the wall of your home and claim to your friends that you painted it yourself, decades ago when you were a younger vampire. When they ask you to prove you can paint, simply look at the paintbrush with a distraught look on your face and say, “Oh no. I don’t paint anymore. Not since that day… no, I’d rather not talk about it.”, Your supernatural strength, senses, and the physical mastery over your body should translate to graceful, controlled motion in everything you do. A vampire has lived to see it all, and is surprised by virtually nothing. Be confident in your character and always carry an air of mystery around you. This will give people the impression that you are more than you seem. Maybe even supernaturally more than you seem. To improve your sense of grace, you might:


Learn to dance
Improve your balance
Improve your agility

, As a vampire, you'll be surrounded by the temptation of human blood constantly. It is only through a supreme act of self-control that you prevent yourself from sinking your teeth into a nice human meal, and this should reflect itself in your behavior. However, just like humans have different personalities, so too do vampires. You might be a seductive vampire, you might be more aggressive, you might be serious and scholarly, or something else entirely.


Whatever you decide, you should be refined and controlled in all you do. Remember, as a vampire you have improved senses and likely have lived many years. These qualities will certainly make human affairs seem more trivial, giving you an air of aloofness.In most vampire mythologies, due to the fact that vampires are already dead, they cannot cry. Be sure you keep your emotions in check during the sad parts of movies if you want to preserve your vampire persona.

, One of the most notable features of Twilight vampires is their eyes. To simulate this look, you might have your eye doctor prescribe gold contact lenses if you plan to be a “vegetarian” vampire or red lenses if you plan to be a human blood drinker. You could also order your contacts online. For hair you might want to choose elegant styles, like a classic updo or a stylishly tousled look for men.


The vampires in the Twilight series are fair skinned and nearly perfect in appearance. Men and women can both achieve this look by using foundation and concealer to create a flawless, light skinned complexion.
Add glitter to your visible skin. A remarkable feature of Twilight vampires is that they sparkle in the sunlight. You should add a light dusting of glitter to give yourself a supernatural sparkle.

Apply some eyeliner to give your features a more supernatural, sharper, and sexier appeal to those who see you. You might even try a smokey eye with your makeup. Try not to overdo it – the look you’re aiming for might be described darkly enticing.
If you’re not a fan of wearing contact lenses, you could always claim that your natural eye color is a contact lens. Tell your friends that you feel like your natural eye color attracts too much attention. Or you could claim that your superior vampires have commanded you not to reveal your true form to humans without permission. Take liberties with your character and have fun!, Your style of clothing should be elegant and classic. As a vampire who’s been around for a century or two, you’ve had time to accumulate a wardrobe that’s refined to your tastes and personality. You’ve also seen fads come and go, and you’re too smart to be swayed from tried-and-true, classic outfits. This is why your species tends to buy clothing that is described as classically beautiful.


A good way to gather classic clothing on an affordable budget is to shop at secondhand stores and thrift stores. These shops will often have retro outfits sold at a fraction of the original cost.

, Meyer’s Twilight vampires are allowed to eat human food, but due to the fact that the bodies of vampires cannot digest food, they must cough up any food they consume. However, as a classic vampiric trait is abstaining from food and surviving solely from blood, you utilize this superstition to your advantage while acting like a vampire from Twilight.



Make yourself small, energy and nutrient rich snacks. Food similar to meal replacement bars will have many of the nutrients you need to keep healthy, but will be small and easy to hide from others. This way, when you do get hungry, you can find a hiding place to eat your meal replacement bar, or other healthy snack, in secret.

, Another characteristic of vampires in the Twilight series is that their breath and scent are irresistibly attractive. A sweet, pungent aroma to your breath will give people the sense that you have the same naturally sweet smelling aroma as a vampire from Twilight!


You might also want to wear a cologne or perfume that you find to be primal and attractive to others. Which perfume or cologne works best for you will depend on a lot of personal factors, so you might want explore fragrances that suit you at your local department store.

Wear essential oils to give yourself a refreshing, alluring atmosphere, or consider making a perfume with essential oils. These concentrated herbal oils carry a powerful scent, but by diluting or preparing the oil in certain ways, you can create a powerfully attractive body scent unique to you.
There are many combinations of essential oils you might use, but to get that sweet elusive scent, you might use fragrances like musk, leather, cinnamon, and honey. Combine these scents in the ratio of one part essential oil, six parts perfume diluent (or rubbing alcohol), and one part fixative (like liquid benzoin)., You might want to spend some time memorizing your history lessons. A general knowledge of world history will help you to claim outdated technology or ancient events as something you experienced. For example, if you were to see a buggy and carriage, you could claim, “I remember when buggy and carriage was the only means of travel. Though I was quite fond of trains when they finally came around.”


To better understand the spirit of the times you learn about in your historical studies, you should also read some literature from these periods. Literature is a reflection of the ideals and issues of the period of time in which it was written. By reading books from the historical times you study, you’ll have a better feel for the language and spirit of the times. For example, you might say in English class, “Everyone romanticizes about Shakespeare’s time, but it was awful back then. It was easier for me because I was a vampire. The worst part about it was the smell… plumbing has improved a lot in the last 60 years.”, The vampires in Meyer’s Twilight series have special abilities they make use of in both the movies and books. From exerting psychic power to cloud minds or convince people to perform tasks, to their keen sense of danger before it happens, there are many mystic traits you could choose. However, it will be difficult to prove many of these “mystic” powers.Decide what kind of mystic power you'd like to have. Some common vampiric powers include mind control, changing forms to nocturnal animals or fog, moving objects with mental power, the ability to predict the future, heightened senses, increased speed/reflexes, and many more., Choosing to have a mystic power like the ability to see the future might be your best bet for convincing others you actually possess this ability. Say vague and metaphorical things about future events, and then after things come to pass, interpret the things you have said to describe what’s already happened. Keep doing this until everyone believes you really can predict the future. Or you could become clairvoyant.You can give your predictions an air of mystery if you do some set up beforehand. A classic séance generally involves you and others sitting around a table in a dimly lit room, with a mystic object, like a crystal ball, at the center of your group. This kind of setup may make your friends take you more seriously than if you had only claimed you could see the future.

, If you plan to choose the ability of telekinesis, which is a fancy name for the ability to move objects with your mind, you might benefit from learning lots of Levitation Tricks. Once you master many levitation tricks, perform these on various occasions to leave your friends bewildered. When they ask, “How did you do that?” Simply tell them, “I’m a vampire. I moved it with my mind.” Particularly you might want to learn how to:Levitate
Levitate a Card
Levitate a Coin
Levitate an Object

, If you want to appear psychic, train yourself in the art of cold reading people so that you can discern information from them at a glance. You’ll want to observe things like mannerisms, accessories, fashion sense, politeness, and so on. Then you’ll use this information to make predictions about the person whose mind you are ""reading.""


Once you are practiced at cold reading, you’ll be able to seem like you are psychic by saying things like, “Ah, Mr. Smith. How did you like the panda exhibition?” He’ll think you’re psychic that you knew he was at the zoo earlier, but what’s really happened is that, while cold reading him you noticed a pamphlet from the zoo sticking out of his pocket."

Ask about volunteer work at your local public library.,
Consider becoming a library page.,
Inquire about other jobs at the library.,
Look for opportunities at your college or university.,
Compare library assistant job requirements.",How to Work at a Library1," The staff member at the reference desk can give you more information on volunteering, or direct you to someone who can. Public libraries often have volunteer opportunities for people without any library-related experience or education. Your volunteer work might include shelving books, repairing damaged books, helping patrons at the circulation desk, or assisting the children's librarian.;
, Library pages are usually paid, but may be temporary or part-time employees. The work is similar to what a volunteer would do, typically shelving books. This may be your best bet at paid library employment if you are not a college student, and do not have a college degree.


The librarian at the reference desk should be able to tell you about this program as well.

, It's important to note that not every library job role involves being a librarian or requires a library science degree. Almost all libraries need a janitor, and the larger ones need security guards as well.

, If you are a college or university student, visit your school's library. It may hire students as library assistants. These positions can often be scheduled around the student's class schedule and may or may not be connected to the student's financial aid package.

, A library assistant position is an entry-level job opening that handles the day-to-day work in the library. Requirements vary greatly between libraries. Small libraries are more likely to have low requirements, and may even train high school students. More commonly, you'll need a high-school diploma, and sometimes college-level coursework in library science.


Some libraries use the term ""library technician"" interchangeably with ""library assistant."" At others, technicians are at a higher rank and have higher educational requirements.

"
As a place of study, many people find libraries the ideal location for studying or completing business or academic work.,
If you run into somebody you know, take your conversation into the lobby or outside of the library to avoid disrupting others.

,
Turn your cell phone off or put it on a silent or vibration setting.,
If you are listening to music or audio through headphones, make sure the volume is low enough to where it is inaudible to others.

",How to Act in a Library1," Make sure to whisper or speak in extremely low tones at all times.;
,, Under no circumstances should you ever have a cell phone conversation inside the library.

Check the bulletin board or website.,
Visit the library before applying.,
Send in your resume.,
Research local politics.,
Network.",How to Work at a Library2," Most libraries have a bulletin board where they display notices of special events and, occasionally, open positions. Check this occasionally so you can apply for jobs you're qualified for, or to find out what requirements you can work toward. The library may also advertise job openings on its website, or on local government websites.


Most libraries are non-profit institutions supervised by a board. Compared to most employers, this gives them less leeway for discretionary hiring. You're unlikely to be hired based on personal connections, and meeting the stated requirements is usually mandatory.

, When you see a job opening that fits your level of experience, visit the library in person. Evaluate the service you receive and the experience of visiting the library. Ask questions of the library staff. Look at the program schedules, the technology available, and other library resources. All these things give you material to talk about in your interview, both for showing that you've done your homework, and for offering suggestions of things you could contribute.


For example, if you visited a library program, come up with ideas to improve it. If a kids' gardening program is popular, suggest starting a seed library.
Gather as much information as possible about the library where you are applying for a job:

the domains the library covers
the classification system used
the database used
whether the library has digitized versions of books



, Many public library jobs, especially in large cities, have a computer scan the resumes rather than a human being. These resumes must include certain key words from the job description, or the applicant will not be considered for an interview.


In your cover letter and during the interview, highlight the qualities that would make you a good librarian (organizational skills, attention to detail, social skills), as well as your interest in the library and the domains it covers.

, Find out everything you can on politics which might affect the library, before you interview there. Has its funding been in jeopardy, or have hours or services cut? Consider a role as an advocate or supporter of the library. Look into a ""friends of the library"" group which may be serving this function.

, If possible, get acquainted not only with the librarians on staff, but with the board members who do the hiring. If, after applying, the library invites you to meet the board, the friends of the library, or another citizen's group, treat it as an extension of the interview. Be professional and engaged.

Look for jobs that require a college degree.,
Study for a Master's in Library Science.,
Specialize.,
Train for an academic library.,
Consider working in a special library.",How to Work at a Library3," Some librarian positions in public libraries require only an associate's or bachelor's degree. These types of positions are often for teen and children's librarians.

, Almost all intermediate and advanced level library jobs require a Master's in Library Science (MLIS). These professional librarians have more advanced duties, such as overseeing the assistants or updating the library's collections.

, Librarians fill many roles, including reference librarian, corporate librarian, cataloguer, library manager, collections manager (deciding which books are added and removed), children's librarian, teen librarian, school librarian (K-12), academic librarian, systems librarian (involves IT work), or running the circulation desk. Research the roles that sound interesting to you, and focus your education towards these positions.


Many library science programs also offer a specialization in archives. Archivists handle historic texts, preserving them physically and granting access to them for research.

, Many academic librarians also hold an additional master's degree in a specific subject. If you're passionate about an academic subject, such as art, law, music, business, or psychology, this path can combine it with your interest in libraries.

, Special libraries are usually private, company libraries that hold collections centered on legal, business, medical, or government resources. Most librarian positions in special libraries require a minimum of a master's degree in library science. A librarian may also need to have degrees or experience in the special library's specific subject area. Example subjects include law, business, science, and government.

Eating can be a noisy process, especially if you are chewing loudly or eating from bags that crinkle or rustle.,
Eating and drinking in the library is also potentially risky because it may harm materials, especially books and computers.",How to Act in a Library2," Make sure you eat snacks in a designated section of the library away from others who are studying or reading.

, Food can also attract unwanted pests.

"
"
Refrain from highlighting passages in books or materials because not only is it considered defacing property, but highlighting passages also makes text hard to read when making copies.

,
Do not damage or deface library materials by writing on them with pen or pencil or tearing covers or pages out of books.

",How to Act in a Library3,","

Always utilize library furniture for studying and reading; never rearrange library furniture or use it for napping or sleeping.

,
Library restrooms should be never be used for showering or washing your clothes.

Borrow with a friend.,
Leave the book where you absolutely know you can see and find it.,
Check your library account like clockwork.,
Get transport help.,
Return the book on time to avoid the fine.",How to Avoid Library Fines," If this isn't clear, ask the librarian. Just taking notice of this is important, as it settles deep inside your subconscious as a reminder.;
, You have to read at a pace that's good for you. Even if you did pace yourself and still need some more time, just renew the book! Next time think about reading a little more each night.


When you're too lazy to read one day, then make up those missed pages the next day, so you always are on track!







, That will help you to remember when it's return time., Mark when the book is overdue, so that it's impossible to miss the return date. If you have a cell phone, set a reminder there too, just to be extra safe.

, Go with a friend to the library, if you want read the same book. Or get a different book that has close to the same amount of pages. Make sure that you both have the same overdue dates. You guys can read together and tell each other your point of view about the respective book.

, For example, on your bedside table, or in your schoolbag (it depends if you need the book for school or if it is just for leisure). This way, you will always see the book.


If you have it in your schoolbag or other bag, make sure you don't leave it at school in a classroom or at work on your desk. This could cause you to lose the book, and gain an even larger fine.

, Set a regular weekly time to look up your library account online, to see what books you have checked out and when they're due back. That way, you'll always be across the due dates and know what's coming up for return shortly., If you don't have a ride, walk, ask a friend, or take a bus.

Make a sign that has something that proves Twilight sucks.,
Complain about how the shape-shifters (werewolves) are in the books.,
Realize what a terrible character Bella is.,
Admit that Edward is a controlling, arrogant brat.,
Discuss overuse of dictionaries.,
Terrible character development.,
Plot holes.,
Also, note that all the women in these books depend on their boyfriends, or husbands, for everything.,
Meyer's descriptive appearance matches Bella's perfectly.

The werewolves are pedophiles.,
Bella is unnaturally obsessed with Edward.,
J.K Rowling's books, theme is saving the world.,
Also note, that the books, 1. drugs, 2. rape, 3. dropping out of high school, to name a few things.

",How to Act Like an Anti Twilighter," It can be a protest sign, or something that says how much Twilight sucks. (e.g. vampires don't sparkle in the sunlight, they die.). This is the most popular protest they have about Meyer's books. But, go with your own, or write fan-fictions about how much it sucks.;
, Like, how they 'imprint' on Bella's baby in Breaking Dawn. And complain about how werewolves turn into wolves when there is a full moon, not when they become angry.

, Also, complain about how dull and boring Bella is. She is a one-faced character, and her life is boring. Also, confront the book by also complaining about how much of a whiny, bratty, picky, clingy, brat she is.


She mocks her own friends.
When she first meets Jacob, she uses his crush on her to coldly manipulate him for information.
Why does every boy like her on the first day of school?

, He forced Bella into having them get married, emotionally abuses her and makes her feel bad.


He breaks the car down so she can't see Jacob, or won't let her be around her friends.
Bella does not get a say in most decisions. She is nearly an adult, yet he and his family consult her no more often than one would consult a toddler.
When Edward leaves Bella, she is devastated for months. Why does nobody take her to a doctor for depression treatment, or question the health of the relationship?
If Edward fears he cannot control himself around Bella, why does he keep toying with her? How much did he really value her life?
This is the most dangerous aspect of the Twilight series: it tells women and girls that abusive relationships are acceptable and desirable.

, Meyer's books always have big words in a sentence, but the outcome never makes sense at all.

, Meyer's books always somewhat have terrible character development. Was she rushing to get the books done? Who knows. These books' characters never have great behavior.

, This book(s) are filled with plot holes. They never seem to make sense. This is yet another one of the biggest complaints about these books.

, Meyer makes all the women in her books weak. Even Leah.


Is it really okay for her husband to hurt her so badly it leaves a scar?
If it's true love, why didn't he control his temper more carefully?

,, Imprinting on a 3 year old, or even a newborn baby?

, It isn't true love; they love each other for their looks; or smell.

, Stephenie Meyer teaches how important having a boyfriend is.

Check out a book.,
Check out – lots of other stuff.,
Get connected to the internet.,
Join targeted reading groups.,
Treat your local library as the place that expands your horizons and keeps you well informed.,
Encourage your children spend time discovering the library on a regular basis.,
Start a business using the help of your local library.,
Consider volunteering at the library.",How to Use a Public Library," Sure, they still loan out books, albeit with a few twists. For example, you'll find it's easier to get a copy of what you're looking for through better systems that allow for inter-library borrowing from libraries elsewhere, broadening the opportunities for locating all titles.


Moreover, many public libraries are now providing access to books in electronic form. You may not even have to visit the library (beyond an initial visit to join) but can sit back at home and search for electronic books, key in your library number and password and enjoy the materials on your laptop, iPad or eReader.
In the United States and some other jurisdictions, libraries are now tied in together, all the local county branches, as well as any community college or other libraries located in the county. Just do a title search on the library computer for any titles not physically there, put in an e-request, and magic library gnomes deliver your request to your branch in a couple of days. Genius.;
, The library is now a multimedia zone, brimful of information in as many formats as formats have been created. If you think it's all about books, you really haven't been to the library in ages. You can borrow movies on DVDs, music on CDs, most popular magazines and some libraries even loan out toys and games.


If the magazine you want isn't in stock, ask about the possibility of getting it in. If they're keeping a list of requests, it may happen once there are enough requests for it.
Ask about online subscriptions to newspapers. This will get you around the subscription payments for a number of newspapers online and still ensure you access to your preferred reads.
Online subscriptions can include journals, articles, newspapers, magazines, reports, booklets, eBooks, legislation, local ordinances or regulations, property information, templates or precedents for legal and other documents and more.
Another source of library information includes readers advisories – these are created by librarians who will recommend new books/authors for you based on what you tell them you enjoy reading. There will often be lists of subject areas that you can collect for free.

, It would be hard to find a library without a computer nowadays and most of them will provide some form of internet access, whether free or paid by time slots. You may need to use your library card for ""time"" on or simply purchase slots of time – ask the librarian for details.


Just be sure to heed the usual copyright rules and don't download anything that is illegal because that will just get your library into trouble and could lead to restricted or no internet access, which would be really sad.
As well as surfing online, you may be able to take online classes through the library. The library may even run its own online classes in certain subject areas – ask them. And if you're skilled in some area, maybe you can teach one to help other library visitors learn something new.
You can also access a local library system online now, from your home or smartphone, to check for availability of resources, and put them on hold, or to order titles from other libraries in that same system, and many other functions that might have previously required your physical presence at the library.

, Libraries will often hold reading group sessions targeted to the very young through to the senior citizen. In particular, you might find it really helpful to drop off a toddler for a half hour reading group while you sit quietly in a corner with a good book or perhaps you're wanting to learn a language or improve your English (ESL, English as a Second Language) and there are language groups happening that you could join.


If you have difficulties reading or you're blind, ask about special reading opportunities for dyslexia, adult reading learners and braille as your library might be able to accommodate them.
As well as reading groups, libraries often offer other groups including craft, art, bookmaking, computer classes, open source and wiki discussions, learning about other cultures, foods, etc., environmental awareness, games and more.

, The library is a place where you can amble along at your own pace and read in a quiet corner or study amid a busy hub of students.


The library is like a place of refuge whatever stage your life is at – it's a place to learn about anything at all whether you're going through a transition, finding a job, learning specific subjects, wanting to understand about your body and health, looking for new recipes and ways to keep house, getting DIY answers, learning about pets, discovering volunteer opportunities abroad, sinking into fiction, flipping through the latest fashions, and so forth.
The beauty of the library is that it can always help to open up your world and opportunities by providing you access to information that is quality, varied and comes with a friendly helper in the form of the librarian.
Ask about lunchtime or other seminars held or hosted by the library. Many libraries invite speakers and authors to come and talk about a topic they know well and it's usually for free. This can be a great way to catch up on the latest information about things that interest you.
While the internet provides ample opportunities for exploration and retrieval of information, much of what is online is of dubious origin and accuracy. The library is the place where you can find a guide to your internet searches, including help on how to search online more effectively and finding ways to cut through the inexpert online advice to pinpoint which information online is trustworthy – it's as easy as asking your librarian to help.

, Children who grow up loving books, information and all the other things a library has to offer are children who will be reassured that they can find answers to the questions they have through life by researching it for themselves.


The sooner they feel comfortable searching for and absorbing information, the more likely they will be to embrace lifelong learning and the benefits that this assures them for a solid future. And be sure to let them see you enjoying the library too – that will impact them positively.
See How to teach your young child about the library and How to raise a child who loves to read for more ideas.

, If you're out of work or you're an already keen entrepreneur, your local library can become a launch space for your own business.


You can find information on starting a small business or running a business in your library in the form of books and online information, plus many libraries will help you with locally supplied information about business management shared through chambers of commerce, business bureaus and government entities.
Some libraries will hold courses on small business matters, too; and some libraries may even be able to rent out office space by the hour if you need somewhere to meet new clients. Ask your local librarian to find out what's available to you.
Many libraries will offer printing, faxing and database services that can be helpful to a person just starting up a new business.

, If there are volunteer opportunities available and you're interested in library work, teaching or the sharing of information resources, a volunteer role might be just the thing you're looking for to become involved in library or information work.


Find out what opportunities are available and if there aren't any, perhaps suggest some, such as teaching library clients how to start a wiki or how to write an eBook.

Amazon sells thousands of e-books in their Kindle Store.   If you own an Android phone or Tablet, they will usually have an Android app for getting Kindle books, and reading them; if you don't, Amazon certainly makes sure you have every opportunity for downloading one for free.  You must establish an Amazon account (for which you only need an e-mail address)The free Kindle apps are perfectly good, but developers are constantly marketing improved apps which you have to buy (for a very modest sum, in 2013 anyway) that give you additional features.  Kindle apps are available essentially for free for iPhones and iPads.  Your Kindle book collection can be downloaded into your Kindle Reader, or your phone, or your tablet or your computer, but they maintain a copy for you on their website of every book you buy from them.  These are available anywhere you can get an internet connection.   Your Kindle Library is in the cloud, as they say these days.






Barnes and Noble's Nook app is on Verizon phones, and can be installed for free on Android tablets. iPhones and iPads too, have Nook reader apps.  On the Barnes and Noble website (which we will abbreviate to B+N) there is a page dedicated to their Nookable offerings, called the Nook Store.  Again, you have to set up an account with the website.  When you buy an e-book from there, it is placed on a list they maintain for you called your Nook Library.  On the plus side, your Nook Library is also maintained in the cloud, and you can get your book if you're visiting friends, if you can borrow a computer with an internet links, and a browser.  At the moment, you can only read certain books on the browser, using B+N's proprietary ""cloud reader.""






The Gutenberg Project (named for the inventor of movable type, Johannes Gutenberg) is a non-profit organization that has begun the process of putting Public Domain books of all sorts on the Internet.  Books in plain language are the easiest --by which we mean books with only text, and no illustrations, and no complicated typography, like boxes or tables.  These sorts of books are put on line in one of three different forms:
(A) Plain text.  This means there is only lowercase, uppercase and punctuation, and nothing like italics or boldface or anything.
(B) Html.  This is the form of basic text which is found on the Internet, and has (in addition to plain text) italics, boldface, underlining, numbered lists and bulleted lists, and hyperlinks.   This enables you to click on one place in the text, and be instantly taken to another place in the text (not always a good thing).
(C) Adobe Pdf (""Portable Document Format."")  This format has been around a long time, and permits very flexible formatting of a page, including graphics.  The big drawback to pdf documents is that you must look at the whole page or a part of it; you cannot repaginate, that is, you cannot change the size of the font, and be given a page in that font size; you have to look at the page as if it were a photograph.   Finally, the Gutenberg project provides, for some books,
(D)Epub format.  This is a format that is maintained by an international organization that allows essentially the same sorts of formatting as HTML: bold, italics, etc, and allows the user to resize the font with which he or she is reading, but also permits some flexibility in formatting paragraphs and margins and so forth, which makes for a better-looking page on the screen.  You can download any number of books from the Gutenberg project, or indeed any organization that provides books in any of these formats, or even other formats which you can look up on Wikipedia.  Unfortunately, you might not be able to read these e-books on either your Kindle or your Nook easily.   But you certainly can read them on your Droid, iPhone, or Tablet.  You just have to get a general-purpose e-book reading app, of which there are many.  Fbreader, Aldiko reader, and Moon reader are three.  But things change every day, and it might be possible very soon to read an e-book you got from any free source on any e-reader, including Kindles and Nooks.







,  But the next few things you absolutely must do are


Manage your e-library, which means maintain a complete list of what you have, and ideally when and where you got them, and
Be able to filter your list by author, or sort it alphabetically, or by publisher, or chronologically.  The Kindle books by themselves, and the Nook books by themselves, are managed by Amazon and B+N respectively, since they don't want you getting mad at them.  The free books you might have got from Gutenberg Project or by making them yourself, you have to manage by yourself, because at least at time of writing, neither Nook nor Kindle are willing to host books from outside their systems in their book management.

, There is at least one piece of free software that focuses entirely on managing e-books, and functioning as an e-book reader, namely Calibre, which is freely downloadable.  It maintains your free library (and even books you bought from vendors other than Kindle and Nook), and even helps you get your e-books into your Nook, for instance, or your Sony Reader, or your tablet or phone.  Each piece of hardware (reader, tablet or phone) is different in how it connects with your central collection of free books on your computer, so a single method can't be provided here.  There is a button you click on in the software that says ""Device"", but some work might be necessary before your device is recognized by your computer, and then by Calibre.


In addition, and most excitingly, Calibre helps you actually make e-books from out of your very own materials.  If you have a document in MS Word, for instance, Calibre will convert it into an e-book in EPUB format, which can be read practically on any device, and certainly on a smart phone, tablet, or even a Nook.  (Nook is more hospitable to ""side-loaded"" books than Kindle, at this point in time.)

,  Some organizations, notably Smashwords, accept writing in e-book form (which must satisfy certain style guides, maintained on the Smashwords site), and will undertake to market your work for you, if you establish a contract with them.

Know what eBook readers are.,

Be careful about the ability to find eBooks and download them to your eBook reader.,
Check the eBook provider's breadth of published content access.,
Visit the store to try the eBook reader.,
Don’t rush your decision.",How to Choose an eBook Reader," An eBook reader is a device for browsing electronic files representing books. An eBook reader typically has a low-resolution but low-glare black-and-white screen, often not backlit, the size of a paperback book page. Compared to a general-purpose computer or smartphone which is often backlit, an eBook reader will be thin and light and have a long battery life. eBook readers typically read one or more of several proprietary ""eBook"" file formats. Some eBook readers are also capable of reading documents in other forms, such as open-standard ""ePub"" eBooks, plain text files, PDFs, Word documents, and so forth, and some will also allow you to take notes, sync with other devices, etc. eBook readers don't have the ""feel"" of books, which some enjoy. But they have a few advantages such as being lightweight and portable, and being able to hold a lot more than a single paperback ever could. This makes them ideal for taking away on vacation, for reading in a favorite outdoor nook, or for reading on-the-go.


A dedicated eBook reader may be the most convenient way to read eBook files, but it is not the only way. PC and smartphone software is available free of charge to read ePub and various proprietary eBook formats such as those for Nookand Kindle. It would be good for infrequent use, for back lighting, for a big screen which props itself up (on a computer, perfect for complicated material that requires glancing forward and back repeatedly), or for sampling the eBook concept before buying a reader device.
An eBook reader can make a great gift for someone who is both a technology enthusiast and a reader of long books. Because there are many specialized kinds, make sure the recipient can easily return it if it turns out not to suit his or her needs.
Not all eBook readers can handle the same formats. In addition to certain seller-specific proprietary formats, many readers support HTML, plain text, and JPG but not all support the open standard ePub.This is an important distinction if you want to check out ebooks from your library, or to read the vast library of copyright-free (in the United States at least) ebooks at Project Gutenberg with nicer formatting than plain text files can provide.Be aware that some eBook readers handle PDFs better than others; this is important if you intend to use PDFs a lot.Some of the most common dedicated eBook readers include Barnes and Noble Nook, Kobo eReader, Amazon Kindle, Sony eReader, etc., with each electronic reader having its own features, feel, and capacity. Non-dedicated eBook readers (that is, items that are used for other purposes as well) include your computer, smartphone (with relevant apps installed), and the iPad.;
, There are numerous things that you need to consider when choosing an eBook reader. One important thing to keep in mind is that choosing an eBook reader is fairly much like choosing many other electronic gadgets and even cars in on key respect – it all depends on what you want to do with it, and there is no one right eBook reader for every person, and different features can make all the difference to your choice.Since the features count for everything, the following features are currently the ones to pay attention to:



Memory: How many eBooks or other documents does the eBook reader have the capacity for? Can this memory capacity be increased?

Format type: Can the eBook reader handle a variety of file types or only one type (see previous step)? Is this ability (or lack of it) reflected in the price?

Connectivity: Does the eBook reader have 3G and WiFi connectivity? Most of the recent ones should by now.

Screen friendliness: Here you need to be concerned about viewability, color, size, and reflectiveness (glare).


Viewability: Is it easy to read? Which eBook readers seem most like the pages of a book? Some have more of this feel than others.

Color: Black and white or color? Both have advantages and drawbacks. Black and white is easy on the eye for novels and sun reading (see ""Viewability"" below), while books and other items such as magazines or comics which need color to transfer their beauty and photos (such as art books, cookbooks, graphic novels, etc.), won't appear so well on plain black and white eBook readers and should be experienced in color.

Size: Compare the eBook reader screen with the screen of non-dedicated eBook readers such as an iPad or your laptop to see which you prefer, and if you're happy to downsize your screen reading experience.

Reflectiveness: One of the advantages of black and white eBook readers (using E-ink technology) is that they can be read in full sun without reflecting, glaring, or loss of image, unlike a laptop, color eBook, or an iPad. If you're planning on reading outdoors a lot, keep this consideration at the forefront.



Weight and comfort: Each person's impression of weight and feel is rightly different but there are some things to assess:

Does it weigh less than your usual paperback? It should.
Is it easy to carry and hold? You don't want something that's bulky, awkward, or hard to hold. In particular, be sure to hold the eBook reader in the store to check its weight and to ascertain whether the weight is comfortable for you personally.
You might spend hundreds of hours with your electronic book reader, and it is important that relationship on a physical level is comfortable. For example, one eBook reader might have buttons and screen that are easy to use for paging through content, but after five minutes you notice some eye strain. That product wouldn’t work for you because you are going to need to be able to look at it for long periods without eye strain or headaches.



Battery life: What's the battery life promised by the blurb? You don't want an eBook reader that runs out after an hour of sitting on your hammock at the beach. You could have taken a paper novel along in that case! Can the battery be replaced by you or do you need to send the eReader to a technician for replacement?

Ease of downloading: Is it easy to download eBooks? Do you have to connect to the computer or can it be done without a computer as the intermediary? This can be important when choosing an eBook reader as a gift for an older person who isn't that keen on ""fiddling"" with technology.Share ability: The ability to transfer eBooks to another eBook reader is important, especially if you need to remove purchased books from an old eBook reader to a new one; if you can't do this, you may lose the purchase when the eBook reader dies. Does the eBook reader allow sharing with friends or not?

Other features: What other features does the eBook reader have? For example, does it allow you to add notes? How easy is the process? Some readers have keyboards that work well. Others are difficult to use and can distract you from your reading. How easy is it to ""page back"" and find something? Are there dictionaries and is it possible to upload new ones?

, Although this is a time-consuming activity, it's the most important part of choosing an expensive product, especially one liable to fast changes and updates. You want to be sure that you're getting the best value product for its kind at the time, as well as knowing that it will do absolutely everything you want it to do. The best research will be a combination of reading both professional reviews and user-submitted content because this provides a balance of viewpoints. Where technology reviewers might be paid to focus on about certain features, the consumer points of view should help to inject some realism into the worth or otherwise of the eBook reader.


Ask others about their eBook experiences. Friends and family members may have insights about what is important to know before buying one. For example, some readers only allow you to read down loadable books, but others provide Internet access so you can also read blogs and websites. Asking people who already have used eBook devices is faster than researching the information and most people are generally interested in ensuring you don't encounter the same pitfalls that they did!

, While it may be tempting to purchase an eBook reader from overseas, double and triple check the compatibility for your home area. The problem may be that you cannot download books for it because you live in a different region from where you purchased the eBook reader and that would leave you with a less-than-bargain priced eBook reader! Moreover, check the method by which your eBook reader allows downloads. Some provide WiFi download compatibility and USB download, others only have USB download. What will be most convenient for you?


Look into the breadth of options for getting eBooks that comes with your eBook reader. Some eBook readers enable free reading with a bookstore and loan of items.If that appeals to you, realize that the extent of free reads and loans might be highly dependent on the particular bookstore.
Check your local library's provision of eBooks. Many libraries are now adding eBooks to their lending systems. Talk to your local librarian about eBook reader compatibility issues, especially if you intend on relying a great deal on your library.

, Some eBook readers are able to access more content than others, and the ideal is to get an eBook reader that has the largest content availability possible, to ensure that you can access eBooks that are relevant to your interests. However, the extent of access is changing rapidly and is becoming less of an issue. What is important is to check that the eBook reader that interests you can access the content that interests you. Ask the retailer for more information if your research hasn't made this clear.

, Once you've done the research, make a list of the features you want (see the suggested things to consider above) and take this list along to the store. You may need to visit a variety of stores to cover each eBook reader you're keen to trial. Take a bit of time to play with the eBook readers and to ask the assistants questions about them. It's important to do this manual checking because it gives you the opportunity to hold the item, page through the content, see how the screen appears to you, and to simply get a feel for each type of reader in your own hands.


Try to read at least one chapter of a book to see how the reading feels on each reader. As you're doing so, think about the ease of seeing the text, the ease of turning pages, the ease of finding the information, etc.

, It's a good idea to go home after your trialing expedition and to think through the purchase. You've done the research and the testing, now allow a few days for the right one to surface in your thinking. Don't be swayed by boredom, loneliness, stress, or the urgency of trends; these gadgets are new and therefore subject to a lot of change and if you're going to fork out a lot of money for one, it needs to be the right one for now.


While some eBook readers might have more bells and whistles than others, if you just want the basics at this stage, a cheaper, less fancy version could be a good initial solution, allowing you to upgrade to a fancier eBook reader as new versions are released down the track. Note that in the short time since eBooks have been released, the prices have been dropping dramatically, so waiting does no harm.
Consider purchasing a reconditioned or used eBook reader. Older models are often just as functional as those which replaced them and can be found for much lower prices.
Be sure to check the warranty information. New products can bring unknown problems with them and it's reassuring to know you can return it without hassle if something goes wrong, as well as finding out what happens if you lose any eBooks due to technical malfunctions.

,, You and the children will have to carry anything you bring. And only pack what you need.

, When you are at the park, you might want to walk around and see what rides and attractions there are so everyone will be able to see what interests them.

, Have each child pick a buddy for the day and every so often do ""buddy checks"". The children must stand with their buddy and if there is a child missing you will always be able to tell. Once everyone is standing with their buddy, count all of the pairs to make sure there isn't a pair missing.

When you are looking for the lost child, retrace your steps for a short amount of time and if you have not found the child go to the meeting place. Also, when you realize one child is missing that is a good time to do a quick buddy check. If the child still can't find anyone at the meeting place after waiting there for a few minutes, tell them to go to a security guard or another mother with children and ask for help.

Choose a roller coaster you want to ride.,
Make a ride reservation.,
Keep the Flash Pass in a safe spot.,
Enjoy other attractions while you wait.,
Locate the Flash Pass entrance.,
Cancel ride reservations if you change your mind.",How to Use a Flash Pass at Six Flags," A Flash Pass is great for skipping lines, but it can be quite costly if you are going to Six Flags with a larger group. A Platinum Flash Pass (the most expensive pass) would cost $896 for a family of four, and that’s not including parking and food. The Flash Pass would definitely be worth it on busy days, but it might not be if you visit the park when it’s not peak season.A regular pass is usually about $45.
You can go to the park and look at the screen that shows wait times to decide if the pass will be worth it.;
, Six Flags theme parks may have different Flash Pass plans and prices, though many parks do offer the same plans. Typically, three different Flash Passes are offered. There is a regular Flash Pass, Gold Flash Pass, and Platinum Flash Pass. The regular Flash Pass is the cheapest, and the Platinum is the most expensive. Determine which plan best meets your needs and fits your budget. The Gold Flash pass promises to reduce wait time by 50%. This pass usually costs about $70.
The Platinum Flash Pas promises to reduce wait time by 90%. This type of pass can range from $100 to $145.
Some parks also offer an All Season Flash Pass.

, The simplest and easiest way to buy the Flash Pass is online. Go to the Six Flags website for the location you will be visiting. Find the section for Flash Passes and choose a pass. Select how many people will be in your group. Although up to six people can be on one device for the pass, you will need to purchase each pass separately. Fill in your billing information and then you can pick up the pass when you arrive at the park.It is important that you make sure you’re buying a Flash Pass for the right Six Flags theme park.
You will need to bring your ID with you. Only one person per group will need to leave their ID are the registration center. Their ID will be held while using the Flash Pass and will be given back when they return the device.

, It’s okay if you can’t buy the pass online. You can buy a Flash Pass when you purchase your entry tickets at the gate of the park. Keep in mind that the wait will probably be longer if you wait to purchase the tickets and Flash Pass at the park., When you purchase a Flash Pass, you will usually receive a Q-Bot, which is a device used to make ride reservations. One Q-Bot can be used for up to six people. The device resembles an oval-shaped beeper. The Q-Bot will have a screen that you can scroll through to make reservations for rides., Individual Six Flags theme parks offer different rides, so your choices will vary from park to park. The easiest way to see which rides the Flash Pass works for is to check the list online at your specific park’s website. You can also check with park operations for a complete list of which rides are eligible for the Flash Pass service.The pass will usually work for all of the major rides at the park.

, Do this once you've identified the ride you want to go on. This is done by either scanning a pager-like device through the reservation stations in front of each Flash Pass compliant attraction, or by entering the information on your Q-Bot. The reservation system varies by park, so check with Six Flags officials about the reservation process at each park., Once you’ve made your initial reservations, keep the Q-Bot in a safe place while you enjoy the park. Most of the Flash Passes will come with a clip, so it is best to clip it to a belt loop or somewhere else that is secure. You can also keep it in a pocket, but don’t carry it around in your hand if you don’t have to.The pass could be dropped or lost if you carry it around in your hand.

, Once you've filed your Flash Pass reservation, you're free to enjoy other attractions at Six Flags. Your Q-Bot will notify you when it's time to go to your reserved Flash Pass attraction. It will typically notify you by vibrating, so keep the Flash Pass close to you., Each attraction offers a separate entrance for Flash Pass users. The entrance will either lead to a different line, or allow you to cut the regular line. An employee will scan the Flash Pass to confirm your reservation, and then you can enjoy your ride with little to no wait time.Some rides will require to sit in Flash Pass rows.

, It’s okay if you want to take a break or change your mind about a ride. It’s simple to cancel reservations. The Q-Bot should give you an option to cancel ride reservations, but if not, you can ask an employee."

Get into shape.,

Make sure your makeup is pixel perfect.,
Practice your smile.,
Consider the realities of circus life.",How to Run Away With the Circus," To be a part of any circus, you should be highly capable physically. Before you join in the clowning about, practice your flexibility for a few months. If you're interested in trapeze or aerial silk, make sure to stretch every day and practice flexibility exercises. Eat healthy foods, and stay as physically active as you can.;
, Circuses usually require auditions, and you should build a repertoire. Look into things like acrobatics, diabolo, unicycle, and trampolining. Once you've picked something to study, get equipment for it and begin practice. Build a bit of a show, perhaps with a theme for entertainment value, to attract possible employers and for use in auditions.

, Some performance attire can be revealing, tight-fitting, or simply wacky. Make sure you have the right costume for you, and that it fits your act. For example, you wouldn't want long, flowing sleeves for fire dancing.

, In the circus, you have to do everything yourself with no help from a makeup attendant. So purchase and collect your own makeup. Good things to use are shiny eyeshadow and diamond studs. If your show has a theme, play off of it. For example, a show based around fire might involve brightly colored makeup.

, Yours may vary based on your act and your own personality. Some performers may opt for a sexy, one-sided smile, but a friendly grin can also warm the hearts of your audience.

, The circus is a crowded environment by nature, and you may not have much time alone. If you can't stand the thought, consider performing in another setting.

Purchase your tickets in advance.,
See if your memberships offer special discounts.,
Find coupons online and through the park’s social media feeds.,
Get multi-day or annual passes.,
Schedule your visit at a lower-volume time.",How to Save Money at Amusement Parks1," The number one way to save money at amusement parks is to avoid buying your tickets the day of your trip. Some amusement parks offer discounts on any tickets purchased online.By planning and purchasing in advance, you’ll be able to check for flash sales, special discounts, and you can schedule your trip at the most affordable time.;
, Organizations like the National Education Association (NEA), American Automobile Association (AAA), and AARP (formerly the American Association of Retired Persons) offer members special discounts. Check with these and other organizations to see if you’re eligible for any deals.Deeper discounts are sometimes offered to members on specific days of the week.
Some credit card companies also partner with major amusement parks and offer their cardholders special offers when you purchase tickets with that card., Online deals are easy to come by, so keep an eye on sites like Groupon, LivingSocial, Undercover Tourist, and RetailMeNot. Some of the best deals can also be found on amusement parks’ social media feeds.If you have a specific park in mind, follow their Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, and download their mobile app.
You can also look for coupons offered by an amusement park’s partners, like fast food chains or beverage companies.

, If you’re open to a weekend or week-long trip, research the park’s multi-day pass options. Many offer a third day free when you purchase a two day pass. Typically, the more days the pass covers, the deeper the discounts.Chain amusement parks, like Six Flags, usually honor season passes at all of their locations. Season passes also typically come with extra perks, like parking deals and exclusive ride times, so splurging on them might be worth your while., Amusement parks have become experts at increasing attendance through discounts and special events, so there’s not really a true off season anymore. However, you can still find deals and smaller crowds during lower-volume times, which include mid-January through mid-February, late August through September, and early December.You can find reliable crowd calendars at TouringPlans.com to see how busy a major amusement park usually is on a given day of the year.If possible, book your trip on weekdays for the deepest discounts."

Determine whether you really want to do this.,
Go with someone close to you.,
Go in a group.,
Stay close to reality.,
Enjoy yourself.,
Plan something afterwards.",How to Survive a Haunted House," If you're somebody who gets easily scared in horror movies/themes, then you may just end up getting badly scared and not enjoying yourself at all. So check that you definitely want to do this. It's okay not to--it doesn't mean that you're a ""chicken"". You just didn't want to do it.;
, Go with somebody you're comfortable around and are especially close to. That way, when/if you get scared, you can hold onto each other. Plus, things don't seem as scary when you've got a friendly face by your side.

, Things can be scarier when it's just two or three people--you feel more helpless. Try going with a group of at least four--things will be more fun and it won't be as scary.

, If you start to get really scared and are regretting going in, then calm down and remind yourself that this isn't real. Tell yourself that it's just pretend, and that it's provided for your enjoyment. Another good method is thinking about what will happen when you get out of the haunted house--driving home, going to the park, lunch, etc.

, Don't run around totally freaked out and screaming. Calm down, and enjoy everything--the suspense, the effects, etc. Remember that the only reason the haunted house exists is so that people can have a fun time. So let yourself get spooked--enjoy it!

, Plan something that's as not scary as possible, whether it be shopping, hanging out with friends/family, or going to a restaurant. Try to make it so that you're surrounded by people and don't have too much time to start thinking about the haunted house again.

Carpool or take public transit.,
Check for hotel deals and packages.,
Look for a nearby hotel with a free shuttle.,
Take advantage of your hotel’s amenities.",How to Save Money at Amusement Parks2," If you have lots of people joining your amusement park trip, try to fill up a van instead of taking two cars. That way, you’ll cut your parking costs in half. If there’s a bus or rail line nearby, use public transit to get out of parking costs altogether., If you’re planning a weekend or week-long vacation, look for packages and deals before you book a hotel. Some on-site or nearby hotels will offer discounts on tickets, express passes, and other perks.While usually more expensive, an on-site hotel might offer perks worth the extra cost, plus save you money elsewhere, such as on car rental or parking fees., Many hotels located near major amusement parks offer free shuttles to and from the park. If you can use a free shuttle, you’ll eliminate the need to rent a car and save a bundle on parking fees.Check potential hotels’ websites or call their office to find out if they offer free shuttles. Even if a shuttle is isn’t free, see if using it will cost less than parking.

, Water rides often cost extra at amusement parks. Instead of paying for an extra pass, head to your hotel’s pool after going on all of the park’s regular rides. If your hotel has a fridge, store inexpensive meals and snacks, like sandwiches and fruit, to cut your food budget."

Bring refillable water bottles.,
Check the park’s outside food policy in advance.,
Purchase souvenirs online after your trip.",How to Save Money at Amusement Parks3," Almost all amusement parks have water fountains or will fill a cup of water for free at concession stands. Instead of forking over two or three dollars for a bottle of water, bring a refillable container to quench your thirst.To be on the safe side, check the park’s policies to make sure they allow outside beverages.

, Buying food at park concession stands will cost an arm and a leg if you’re feeding an entire family. Some parks allow guests to bring outside food, which you can either keep on hand or store in a locker.Even if you can’t bring food into the park, you can store food in a cooler in your car. Just make sure you can re-enter the park (preferably without waiting in line) after you head to the car for a lunch break.

, One of the easiest ways to cut your amusement park budget is to skip the souvenirs altogether. If you or your kids really need a knick-knack or tee shirt, try to find your desired items on eBay instead of purchasing them at full retail price at the park’s gift shop.If you do plan on buying souvenirs on-site, give your kids a firm souvenir budget before you enter the park."

If not, research beforehand. If there doesn't seem to be any attractions that you like, don't force yourself.;
, Make sure you know how much tickets cost and buy them beforehand if necessary. If you are sure that you want to go multiple times, see if a season pass is worth the money. There are sometimes passes that are used up once you go on a certain number of rides. If you only want to ride a few, opt for these, but if not, make sure you are buying a pass that will let you ride all day.

, If you’re making a multi-day vacation of it (which is a good idea if you want to hit up the amusement park), staying on site or nearby will make it all much easier.

, While it may seem tempting, riding rides in whatever order you feel like can mean you travel from one end of the park to the other many more times than is necessary, and your feet will be very sore as a result. To avoid this, get a park map and use it. Ride things in order, or at least ride everything you want to go on in one specific area of the park before moving on to another.

, Depending on how long you will be at the park, make plans for what you will eat. Keep in mind that park food is expensive.

, If you have nausea but otherwise enjoy park rides, there should be nausea-relieving pills at your local drugstore or pharmacy. Take these beforehand. Unless you're sure that you won't be nauseous, it's best to have these with you.

, Dress lightly (but take a jacket if you need to) and take only what you need. If you take your own food, check the park permits this and make sure your amusement park offers storage first. Try to check the weather report for the area you're going visit. Dress accordingly for the weather. Try to avoid wearing dark colored clothes (such as black or dark grey) if it is during summer. Wearing these colors could make you more warm and you may start sweating. Also, if you're going on the water rides, have a swimsuit on underneath your clothes.

, Flip flops aren’t really the best idea for an amusement park, especially rides that leave your feet dangling. Wear supportive sneakers or walking shoes.

, If you want to wear a hat, always remember to put it in a secure pocket before going on a ride. Keep your wallet or purse secure! They can be easily lost in the hustle and bustle of an amusement park.

, Hair past shoulder length can easily get tangled on a windy ride. Braids are recommended, as they stay closer to the head and don't have loose hair like ponytails.

, Many coasters can be rough, and you don’t want holes poked into the back of your head. Some earrings may get stuck in your hair or attire. However, if you really want to wear earrings, wear non-dangling ones such as studs or pearls.

, Especially in the summertime. Most of the ride lines will subject you to the elements, whatever they are.


Take a water bottle. It's easy to get dehydrated out in the sun all day.

, Unless you’re visiting with someone who won’t be riding most of the rides, don’t take huge bags or purses with you if you can help it. You won’t be able to take these on most of the rides. You’ll either have to leave them with a non-rider, pay for a locker, or stuff them into bins before getting onto a ride. This last option offers no guarantee that someone won’t walk off with your brand new Coach purse while you’re on a coaster.


Wear something with big pockets that either zipper or button closed. All you really need is some cash, and maybe your phone. You can always leave a jacket in your car, and go get it later.
Always take medication with you or take it beforehand. Who knows, you might need it.

, If possible, avoid weekends at any park during the summer months. Once school is out, places like Cedar Point are packed, especially on the weekends.

, If you want to catch the shortest ride wait times and escape the heat of the day, get to the park as early as possible. And people do arrive earlier so they can dash to their favorite rides as soon as possible.

, Take a break from the coasters every once in a while, perhaps throwing in a train or gondola ride (these can also serve as great ways of getting around the park that don’t wear out your sneakers).

, Don't force yourself or a friend to go on a certain ride, especially if you or your friend does not fit the criteria for the ride. If you are too short, weigh too much, have medical conditions or are pregnant, be careful about what rides you decide to go on.

, By leaving it to the end, you won't have to be restricted by the giant stuffed animal you're carrying around.

, Once you are in you can't get out but that shouldn't bother you. Think of funny moments and everything you've accomplished in life. This will take your focus off going up the hill. If this ride is like the top thrill dragster where you don't go up a hill slowly then think of this stuff while waiting for it to shoot off.

,, Hold on wherever it feels the safest or wherever you're instructed to hold on. If you're very scared, holding on is the best option.

Don’t do it for the money.",How to Join the Circus," Circuses have many different acts – and that opens up many different jobs. What’s more, there’s different types of circuses, creating even more opportunities. In order to join a circus, you will need one or more specific skills or talents that a circus would find valuable. This might be Silk aerials, trapeze, acrobatics, juggling, trampolining, tightrope, diabolo, clowning, stilt walking, or anything else remarkable and unique. Most circus work is very strenuous, and you will not be able to learn a skill overnight. It will take dedication, commitment, and practice to become stage ready.


If performing isn’t your thing but you still love the thrill a circus brings, there are lots of jobs in circuses that don't require acrobatics or strenuous physical activities. You could work backstage, with costumes, with animals, or set design and production. However, for the purpose of this article, we will be concentrating on circus performers.;
, Most circus acts, while they look easy and flawless, often need months of practicing and working out before getting it to look right and before it becomes physically safe to do. If you're doing acrobatics, aerials or anything similar, you will need to be very flexible and know how to rely on your body. For trapeze and similar acts, you'll need a lot of upper body strength to keep yourself up and swinging. Most acts will result in the performers getting injured at one point or another; the stronger your body is, the more it can take it.


If you're doing something like clowning or juggling, you won't need to be in marathon-running shape, but you'll need to at least be fit enough to do things quickly, or, for example, to keep your arms up and juggling.

, There are circus performers that don't work for a single circus, but instead audition to be part of a show, like an actor does for different movies. They don't need to stick with just one company, but can be part of their shows anyway for a select period of time. Alternatively, you might want to be part of an official circus. You'll need to constantly be able to perform, and constantly be doing your best, so you can remain in your circus, too. There are ups and downs to every argument – it’ll come down to a matter of personal preference.


Do you want to work for something like Cirque du Soleil? Something more traditional, like Barnum & Bailey’s? Would you rather do something on a smaller level, like performing at fairs and festivals? Ultimately, it’s up to you. Just remember that with bigger gigs and more glory comes more responsibility and commitment, too.

, Before attempting to find a circus that will take you on, you'll need to have an act ready to pitch to your potential employers. Having a background in dance, gymnastics, or something similar really helps, but isn't necessary. This way you have a developed routine that you can bust out at the drop of a hat.


This will essentially be a job. You'll need to find a coach, get the right equipment (for safety, for example), and set aside time each day to be the best in your field. This has to be a priority to be on circus-level.

, In order to attract talent scouts and to get recruited onto a team, you’ll need an act to attract the right person. Whether you’re practicing with your brother in the backyard or with your coach at a first-glass gym, keep practicing. It should be something you can practically do in your sleep, where you know you won’t hurt yourself and mistakes aren’t common.


You want it perfect so when you're called up, you can audition or be a substitute on a second's notice. When you get the circus they may change it as they see fit, but it has to get you there in the first place.

, To apply for worldwide gigs (like Cirque du Soleil), you’ll probably need to make an audition tape, showing your skills. Bigger companies often have online submission forms that you can submit during certain times of year.Showcase the best of your act, follow the appropriate guidelines, and make sure your tape is as professional-looking as possible.


Many circus acts have agents and work through recruiters, too. The more time you spend in the field, the more networked you'll be, making it easier to make and find connections.

, Though they don’t get a lot of press, there are legitimate, credible circus schools out there that are looking for students to teach with skills they can help hone. If there’s one in your area (or even if there’s not), look into it – it’s a great way to meet people that are already established in the field.


There’s a great job outlook, too. Most schools tout one of their biggest selling points as placing 100% (or nearly 100%) of their graduates in jobs., Most people don’t start out playing with the big boys – they do small gigs and then get noticed, breaking in through making a name for themselves. To do this, take whatever opportunities you can. Your high school talent show, your dad’s business luncheon, or the halftime show at a local football game. if you build up your resume, more people will look at your act and take it seriously.


Tell your friends and family members to talk to their friends and family members about your act. You may get booked into private parties and local events just by word of mouth. This is one of the most reliable ways to market yourself and it can spread like wildfire.

, In addition to small, one-off gigs like private parties, think of less traditional semi-related gigs like on cruise ships. You work in a show put together by the cruise line for 6-9 months and then that’s that. This is a great stepping stone to getting to one of the bigger, official circuses around.


Consider websites like Workaway, too, where you can sign up for a period of time and be part of the circus in exchange for room and board. It’s not glamorous, but it’s a step in the right direction!

, Yep, those are a thing. The American Youth Circus Organization holds the Youth Circus Festival every year in August, just as one example.Some people are asked to perform and others get lucky enough to nab a slot – but either way, you’ll be able to showcase your stuff and get seen.


Apply as early as you can, talk to your coach, agent, or recruiter, and get your name in the ring. It may, at least initially, cost you money for travel and what not, but it's a small sacrifice to make to be showcased.

, Now that you’ve built up your resume and have an act you can rely on, go for the big leagues. Apply to the next variation of Cirque du Soleil or Barnum & Bailey’s and get ready for the life of a circus performer. Can you believe you made it happen?


Sometimes you'll apply and won't hear for months. If you don't hear back automatically, don't give up hope, but keep applying elsewhere. Don't shy away from international gigs, too.

, The one brutal fact that most circus hopefuls don't really think about is the fact that they'll be away from home, constantly living out of a suitcase. Life onstage will be glamorous, but life offstage means hotels, vending machines, and sleeping in cars. Some people find this life rewarding, but others find it very challenging. To make it, you've gotta be the kind that thrives in this setting.


It can be very lonely, too. You'll develop a circus family definitely, but your real family may even be thousands of miles away. This, of course, depends on your contract. Only sign up for a period of time you know you can handle.

, Life in a circus isn't all glamorous as it's made out to be. If you're working with a traveling circus, you might have to deal with moving around a lot, and you will probably have to do your own makeup and need to buy or make your own costumes. Working with circuses requires a lot of dedication just to stay optimistic for shows.


If you're working for a legitimate, big business circus, most odds and ends (like costumes) will be handled for you. But if you're working on a smaller circuit, you may need to take certain expenses on yourself. Consider it the price to pay for doing something you love.

, You will, without a doubt, run across people that will say ""No.” You will be told to give up, people won't hire you, and you will get injured or run the risk of being injured if you are a performer. It's very important you be able to push through these walls – or perhaps trapeze your way over them. If you are dedicated and love performing, you will find a job that works for you, and you will be able to continue performing.


No one makes it on their first try. You have to hear a chorus of rejections before you finally ""get your break."" It could take months, it could take years, but you've got to trust that eventually it'll happen. If you don't believe in you, no one else will.

, Being a circus performer is almost like being an athlete – your career will be over well before you feel like you're ""old."" And when you do near the end of your run, your body will have been rung through the wringer. You could be in tiptop shape or you could need two knee replacements. It won't be easy, but hopefully the physical stress is worth it.


In fact, your body basically means your job. If you don't take care of it, you could be out of a gig in no time. It's important to sleep, eat right, stay healthy, and, above all, stay safe. The last thing you want to do is compromise your career because you made poor decisions.

, How does circus work pay? Although it differs from circus to circus, it mostly depends on the job, the show, and the length of which you're working. For example, a circus might pay their performers at the end of each week, or (although it's less common) after the show closes. If you're a performer that hires out to circuses, then you'll mostly be paid after the job ends, although they can choose to pay you weekly, sometimes even after each show (although that is highly uncommon, too). This aside, you should probably want to work in a circus for your love of the work first, the money second.


What’s more, every role gets paid differently, too. If you’re at the bottom of the ladder, you may be getting $300 bucks a week; if you’re a featured performer like an acrobat or a contortionist, you could be making between $40,000 to $70,000 a year. Don’t forget – you’re getting free room and board, too.The perks just keep on coming.

, If a combination wrench is used, do not use the open end of the wrench because it may strip the flats before loosening the bleeder screw.,,,, If it comes out with the end plug, this indicates that it had been assembled improperly.,, Save the lining for future use for replacement of worn linings which does not require full disassembly. This lining is still reusable. However, notice the quantity of rust and exfoliation which has accumulated between the piston and the lining. This rust as it built up actually caused pressure and contributed to the shearing of the upper right hand screw. Before this lining can be reused, it must be cleaned of all these oxide deposits, taking great care not to disrupt the ridge at the bottom where the lining seats into the piston. This area is where all of the braking force is exerted, and the aluminum screws will not shear if it is seated properly. Any movement of the lining in the piston under braking pressure will result in the screws being sheared., Notice as well the excessive amount of rust buildup under where the old lining had seated. This rust has allowed moisture to collect under the lining assembly, accelerating the corrosion process, weakening the aluminum screw due to galvanic effects, resulting in the screw having been sheared off. Before the new lining is assembled to this piston, the rust must be thoroughly removed, sealant will be applied to the new lining to act as a seal and adhesive, and new screws will be installed. Never reuse old screws., Notice the use of a folded rag in the jaws of the vise to prevent damage to the piston .,,,, Inspect the housing bore contact area for corrosion, and remove any which may be present., At this time, do not reuse the old linings because new ones are provided with the rebuild kit. This end plug is not reusable. Notice in the photo to the left that the center hole has been crushed by impact with a hammer or other object, and in the photo to the right, the edge where the o-ring and backup ring installs has severe pitting corrosion. The new pressure compensator will no longer fit into the center hole, and the new o-ring and backup ring will not make a proper seal against the pits left from the corrosion. The end plug in the photos to the left is reusable, and if properly cleaned will provide long service., This is the anodizing which has been attacked by filiform corrosion. The anodizing or gold coloration was applied to act as a sacrificial anode, and the white powdery substance is the produce after corrosive attack. This is normal, and if the corrosion has not pitted the groove where the o-ring and backup ring seat, it will be all right. However, due to the fact that the protective anodizing has been compromised, the bare steel will now corrode under corrosive attack, and protective measures need to be undertaken., If using a flammable substance such as naphtha or isopropyl alcohol, be sure to work in a well-ventilated area, well away from sparks or flames, and for safety's sake, have a safety observer with a CO2 fire extinguisher standing nearby., This area is where the pressure compensator makes its seal, and travel occurs within this area as the piston travels outward during normal liner wear. Normally, there is a small area of wear, where the anodizing has been worn away, with rust or oxide deposits in this area. If there is deep pitting in the wear area, the end plug cannot be reused, or leakage will occur past the pits. Use a folded rag to protect the machined surfaces from damage by the jaws of the vise. Note that brake fluid eats paint if it is left on a painted surface too long, and if brake fluid comes into contact with a customer’s clothing made of polymers, it will destroy them just as well.

When using a cylinder hone to clean out the bore of the housing, be careful not to hone down the threads inside the housing. Also, use the finest possible grit stone that can be obtained, normally only glaze breakers are available from most auto parts stores.
If a coarse glaze breaker has to be used, first smear grease onto the stones, so that the fine oxides removed from the inside of the housing will fill the pores of the stones, and make less abrasive. Doing this means that in the future, these stones will only be good for polishing and honing, so keep them separate from other stones used for rougher abrasive work. The finished product should be as close to mirror-like as possible when done.
If there are obvious signs of scratching from the hone, it is too rough, and should be used on something else to wear it down and smooth it more before final polishing of the housing. Adding grease will close the pores of the stones with the materials removed. For quickly wearing down a glaze breaker to smoother polishing, a piece of pipe, a tin can, or other rounded steel item can be used. It is easier to just purchase the proper stones in the first place, because any scratches put into the housing will have to be removed before going on with reassembly.

, These are 10-24 screws, so use a #25 drill bit to drill these out, and follow with a 10-24 tap to clean the threads. If the proper size drill bit is not available, do not substitute for any other size; these parts are expensive, and a #25 drill bit is very cheap. Do not use a 5/32 drill bit just because it is close to the same size and do not go to a smaller size drill bit, because the likelihood that the tap will break is increased when tapping the holes out. When drilling the holes, put the housing, or piston in a vise so that it will not move, and make sure that you drill straight down through the hole, using both hands, and keeping the drill steady. If it is a piston which is being drilled, use folded rags to protect the outer surface, and test its stability in the vise before beginning to drill to make sure the vise is tight enough, and the piston will not swivel sideways in the jaws. It is much more preferable to use a drill press, but sometimes they are not available. Use a 3/8” drill capable of at least 900 to 1000 rpm, do not use a ½’ drill. Most ½” drills are too slow in rpm, and have such high torque that they might break the drill bit off on breakthrough. Use a sharp drill bit, start the drill at high speed, but with very little downward pressure so it can start its way through the aluminum of the screw, and very slowly let the drill bit do all the work., If drilling has been done, the old thread material needs to be removed. This thread material should be of aluminum, if someone in the past has not put steel screws into the part. Aluminum has a tendency to clog up the tap, so a lot of back and forth tapping should be done.

Turn the tap in just a little, then back it almost all the way out again, never putting more than just the minimum of torque on it each time it is turned in. This is a long tedious process, but if performed in this manner, it will prevent the tap from binding in the steel and breaking. When running the tap through the housing, the tap is traveling through almost ¾” of steel, and there is a very high likelihood of binding.
Use the tee handle in the tap set for this, and use wrist action to twist, do not use both hands on either handle as some persons prefer to do. By using wrist action and one hand, it makes sure that too much torque is not applied, and helps keep the torque straight down the axis of the tap, reducing the chance of breakage. If the tap breaks off inside the piston or the housing, then you have just ruined a very expensive part.

, If necessary, scraping it will help, followed by a small wire brush and brake cleaner to remove all traces of oil and dirt.,,, Make sure they are installed in proper position in groove."

Do some research of the park you’ll be visiting.,
Go fully prepared.,
Be sure to dress appropriately.,
Have a plan.,
Use the buddy system.,
Stay hydrated.,
Be sure to get out of the sun and take frequent breaks.",How to Have a Safe Day at a Theme Park," Find out what their hours are, what day the water park opens; many don’t open until the end of May. Starting early in the morning when they first open is a good idea because it isn’t as crowded and the lines are shorter. And buying tickets beforehand will save you time in line at the entrance gates.;
, Which means packing everything you might need including:


Cell phones, sunblock, towels, swimsuits, sunglasses, comfortable shoes, camera, hats.
Cooler of ice, food and water if you don’t plan on buying food inside the park. Check their website and find out what the park allows to be brought in. Some parks don’t allow food or coolers. Most water parks and many other amusement parks also prohibit glass containers of any kind.
A fully stocked first aid kit. You never know when you might need a band-aid or aspirin. Although there are first aid stations, they are few and far between. Even large parks only have one or two first aid stations, so getting a band-aid can mean hiking a mile.
All prescription medications that people in your group may need. This includes medications like EpiPens, inhalers, etc. And if you’re taking a large group of kids, get all of their contact information in case of an emergency. Also be informed of any preexisting medical conditions of anyone in your group. Conditions like asthma, diabetes, hypoglycemia and epilepsy can be scary if you don’t know what’s going on.

, Wear comfortable shoes that you can walk all day in. Wearing loose clothing will help sweat evaporate and keep you cooler. Wearing a hat and a full coverage shirt will save you from being sun burned.

, Tell the children to look for a park staff member if they get lost and make sure they have your cell number. Make sure to designate a meeting place and time to gather your group when the day is over.

, Never let kids roam the park alone. Sending kids in groups of 2 or more with at least one mature teenager or adult is usually a safe bet. Make sure that each group has a cell phone or a two way radio to stay in contact. This wikiHow article provides useful information on what you should do in this scenario.

, Walking around all day in the summer sun can be a recipe for disaster if you don’t drink enough fluids. You sweat out much more water than you might think; up to a liter per hour of sun exposure. So keep those water bottles in hand and drink up!

, This is especially important during the hottest part of the day (2-5) in the afternoon. It’s during this time that the pavement in the parks has absorbed all of the heat and it will start to radiate everywhere. This means even the shady spots will have heat coming up from the ground, so get into an air conditioned place to cool off.

Practice self calming techniques.,
Tell yourself things that confirm the fun and safety of using the rollercoaster.,
Praise yourself for getting on.,
Go with someone you trust.",How to Keep Calm on a Roller Coaster1," Breathe slowly and deeply and try to think positively, once you have done this it will all be worth it!;
, For example:


""It's not as bad as it looks. They have safety harnesses and the tracks are tested all the time to ensure they're safe. The restraints 'fail-safe' which means that the default position is locked, it takes more effort to open them! Perhaps even look up the statistics of injury on a rollercoaster, you will find that you are more likely to be struck by lightning of get hurt in a car accident! ""
""People scream because it's exciting scary, not bad scary.""
""It's only for a short time. Then I'll probably want to get back on and have another go because it's over so quickly, even if the worst case scenario happens and you hate it, it will only last for about 2 1/2 minutes. Then you have conquered it!""

, Tell yourself: ""Well, I've made it now, it's going to be all right now that I'm on here."" or ""I've finally done it.""

, This can help a lot to keep you calm and to have reassuring feedback from a person who is used to the rollercoaster or is able to deal with fears better.


Be careful not to choose someone as afraid as you. This can turn into a situation where you feed off each others fear and make things seem a whole lot worse!

Look for cleanliness and good maintenance throughout the park.,
Check rides for wear, surface cracks, and weld imperfections.,
Watch the rides for repeated smooth operation.,
Listen for signs of poor maintenance.,
Notice if carnival workers are attentive.",How to Evaluate the Safety of Pop‐Up Carnival Rides1," If the carnival’s staff is skipping out on basic maintenance, they might be cutting corners when it comes to safety. Check the grounds for excessive litter and for unhealthy conditions at areas where they serve food. If you see a staff member pass by a piece of trash, they might not be concerned with ride maintenance or other safety issues., Notice rusting and other signs of wear, especially at critical areas that seem to be load bearing or essential to the ride’s operation. Avoid rides with cracks in any surfaces or improperly welded joints. Steer clear if you notice anything that looks like a quick fix, like a patch of metal that doesn’t match the rest of the ride’s structure., Make sure the ride moves the same way every time it operates. Look for both smooth, repetitive motions in addition to a particular section where it jumps, halts, or does something that seems wrong to you.Keep in mind the differences between how rides are built. A wooden roller coaster is built with a bit of flexibility to account for the wood framework, so it’s okay for it to sway a bit. However, a steel coaster’s structure should never sway at all.

, Typically, you shouldn’t be able to hear grinding, screeching, or other signs of improper lubrication or poor maintenance. If you hear something that concerns you, try to pay attention to what the ride is doing at the time.Does a screech seem to indicate bad brakes as a cart comes to a stop?  
Do you hear metal-on-metal wearing that might be compromising the ride’s integrity?
Ask a ride operator about your concerns. Ask them when the ride was last inspected. If they can’t give you any adequate explanations, ask them to direct you to park management.

, Pay attention to the ride operators, and try to evaluate their level of competency. Do they seem professional, or are they reading a magazine while the ride is in motion? If you bring any safety concerns to their attention, do they show concern or shake off your question?Do they thoroughly check that every rider is properly restrained before starting the ride?
If they seem uninterested in the safety aspects of their job or don’t seem knowledgeable about the ride they’re operating, you might want to skip out on that ride or stick to the carnival’s games and other amusements.

Research your options.,
Show up to the show early.,
Family matters.,
Fit yourself to what they want.,
Stand out.,
In picking-type shows : If you know who picks the volunteers, start a conversation with them.,
In survey type shows : Stand up.,
Enjoy doing whatever foolish thing you've just volunteered to do!

",How to Get Picked As a Volunteer at a Major Theme Park," Find out which shows require volunteers (because it's usually shows), what type of volunteers they're looking for (male, female, over 18 or general) , what you'll be expected to do, and most importantly how and when volunteers are picked. For example, at the Tarzan show a boy and a girl are picked as they walk in, without anyone raising hands (we'll call this picking-type volunteering). At the Indiana Jones show, adult volunteers raise their hands (we'll call this survey-type volunteering). If you can't figure out how people are picked, ask!;
, If it's a picking-type show, they almost always pick people during the first few minutes. If it's a survey type show, you'll need to get a good seat where you can easily be seen by the person who chooses volunteers.

, It's no fun having a volunteer without anyone to laugh at them. Friends work just as well, if not better. If you're alone, find a small family to sit near, if not with.

, At the Tarzan show, they need exactly two people, usually children. So if your party has four children, split up. If you only have one child, sit a single parent with them. At the Flights of Wonder show, have a dollar bill ready and wave it in the air.

, Be memorable. Wear funny hats and bright clothing. Little girls dressed as princesses and little boys dressed as Stitch are hilarious. Look happy and bouncy -- no one wants a sad volunteer. Laugh. If it's your birthday (or anything close), get a button from guest relations. If it's your anniversary, get a button. If it's your honeymoon, get a button and add those silly bride/groom mickey ears.

, Trade pins. Ask where they're from. Ask if the show is good. Ask where the best place to sit is. DO NOT ask if you can be a volunteer. In picking-type shows, you can *sometimes* get away with asking them to choose your child because it's their birthday, but you'd probably have better luck with just mentioning that it's so and so's birthday and he's having so much fun today. Be happy. Don't be annoying.

, The moment they ask for volunteers, launch yourself out of your seat, jump up and down, wave your hand over your head, and shout 'me me me!'. You don't even have to wait for them to finish telling you what to do. Don't sit down. Don't stop hopping. Don't stop waving your arms. Encourage your family to point at you and shout 'him, him, him!' if needed.

Praise yourself at the end.",How to Keep Calm on a Roller Coaster2," Listen for the click or other sound it makes when it shut, several of the newer roller coasters don't have 'clicking' restraints. This means you can have the restraint closer to your lap so you don't moved as much. These restraints are still perfectly safe and they won't unlock during the ride.

, It can be tempting to shut them but you can become disorientated making you feel nauseated. .

, This can help you to keep calm and can reduce the possibility of vomiting. Count under your breath if it helps you to keep your breathing steady.

, There is often music accompanying the ride. This may help to calm you if you concentrate on listening to the words or tune.

, That's what the ride's all about anyway! When you scream going down from high drops, it helps to expel the air and helps you to breathe as well as releasing stress to help you have fun!

, Talking is a good way to distract yourself during the ride. However, if it's hard to hear, you might end up yelling rather than talking, so be considerate of other people. The best time to talk is on the lift hill, this is the part where you have to wait to drop.

, This can help you to feel less scared. It's not ideal to sit here if you're looking for more thrills though. However, if you aim to not see the biggest field of view, the cart behind will allow for that.

, You did it. And you know you can do it again. Overcoming fear is a constant challenge in life and it's a great thing that you're practicing this lifelong skill.

Check for proper safety signage.,
Make sure the ride has proper safety restraints.,
Speak up if you have any concerns before the ride starts.,
Follow all posted safety instructions.",How to Evaluate the Safety of Pop‐Up Carnival Rides2," Most jurisdictions require that carnivals post safety precautions, such as “You must be this certain height to go on this ride.”Look for these postings, and for the carnival’s operating permit. Depending on your jurisdiction, the carnival may also be required to post permits and inspection certificates for each ride.You can search online to find out if your state or other locality requires individual ride permits. Search your local government’s public safety webpage using the keywords “amusement park ride operating permit.”

, While you’re in line, check ahead to be sure other guests have no issues with safety harnesses and belts. If you observe any complaints of loose restraints or dissatisfaction, you should skip the ride. If it comes to be your turn and everything you’ve seen so far checks out, make sure your own restraints fit snugly and lock into place., When you harness yourself in, be sure you fit into the ride’s seat and the harness locks around you comfortably. Pay particular attention if your proportions are especially large or small. If you have any trouble at all, be sure to shout out for assistance to the operator before they start the ride., Avoid rides that specify proportions that aren’t right for your body. If there are height or age restrictions, don’t sneak on or try to sneak your child. Keep your arms inside the cart or other relevant ride capsule.Make sure to read and understand any other safety precautions that the ride’s signage outlines.

Research the safety histories of a ride and a carnival company.,
Check your local jurisdiction’s laws.,
Look up a ride or carnival’s inspection history.",How to Evaluate the Safety of Pop‐Up Carnival Rides3," If you want to stay informed about a carnival stopping in your area, you can always search online to find out more about its history. Enter the carnival company’s name into a search engine and combine it with search terms like “safety” or “accidents.” There’s also a non-profit organization that keeps a detailed record of all international amusement park mishaps: http://www.rideaccidents.com/


Try not to be suspicious or afraid of all amusement park rides, since the vast majority are safe, well-maintained, and issue-free. However, if you’re curious or concerned, you can find out if a particular ride or company has a history of issues. You can also check to see how those issues were resolved.

, Local regulations vary widely, so if you want to evaluate a ride’s safety or inspection history, it’s wise to stay informed about your local laws. For example, in the United States, some states have essentially no inspection regulations whatsoever for traveling carnival rides.The best way to check your local laws is to go to your state or other local government’s website. Look to see if they have a public safety section, or run a general search for amusement park safety regulations.
Check your local regulations to see how often rides must be inspected, who the inspecting body is, and what kind of insurance companies are required to hold.
If you live in a jurisdiction without any regulations, consider doing more research about a particular carnival company’s safety history. In the US,  Alabama, Colorado, Mississippi, Nevada, South Dakota, and Utah have no government oversight or inspection of traveling carnival rides., In the US, many states don’t require carnival rides to be inspected by government employees, but do require some oversight. These states allow companies to be annually inspected by private third-party inspectors. If you have any concerns, you can call the carnival ahead of time and ask who they hire to conduct inspections.You can then contact the inspecting company and request more information about the carnival’s safety history or more information about a particular ride.

Don't walk around too much at once.",How to Enjoy the Zoo," Quite simply, a zoo experience involves spending some time walking and viewing outdoors.;
,, Finding a parking space will be simpler, and there shouldn't be long lines at the admissions booths. For a large zoo, realize it takes a lot of time to visit every exhibit, so coming early will allow more time to see what the zoo has to offer.

, Often, these will have information about different animals, locations of rest rooms and water fountains, and other information to help you enjoy your visit.

, Most zoos are designed with exhibit areas set up along pathways or sidewalks, and the signs at path intersections will guide you to the animals that you are most interested in.

, You may be surprised just how large some animals are when you get close to them. Elephants, hippos, and rhinos are some large species you may see.

, Many zoos have venomous snakes, carnivorous cats, and large reptiles like alligators you can enjoy observing safely.

, Predators use this to ambush prey, and prey also are adapted, to hide from the predators.

, Nature gives some of it's creatures bright fur (or feathers) to attract attention, often to help them find a mate.

, Some species futures may actually depend on the efforts of zoos to maintain breeding and animal health programs, as well as the research that may enhance the animal's survival.

, Zoos are home to many native and exotic species, from local rodents and birds who come and go as they please, to wild mammals, reptiles, and amphibians.

, Some larger, well-funded zoos build realistic display enclosures for some of the animals there.

, This zoo has a special jungle trail where kids can climb and explore, burning off energy and having fun.

, Many zoos have art themes around exhibits to enhance the visitor's experience and to add dimension to the understanding of the subject you are looking at.

Disney world is popular; you may want to go there. Choose your parks carefully. You may want to see if it has restaurants, the rides that suit you, souvenir stands, etc. You don't want to be bored at an amusement park, because usually if you're happy at a theme park then you will have the best time ever. You may want to ask your friends' opinion and facts about the park. Tell them to list the pros and cons of the park. Be sure to write it down.;
, If you know where it is, you might not need a map. But the benefit of getting a map is that if it shows a busy route, you can find another route to go to so you can get there earlier. Some sites that can help are Mapquest, Yahoo Maps, and Maps.com.

, Eat a good breakfast but not heavy as you want to be light on your feet. This way you will spend less time in lines in the park. Other things to bring are cameras, sunglasses, and extra towels. (Most corporate parks, such as Six Flags, Cedar Fair, and Disney, do not allow outside food and drink, unless it's water. Always check signs outside the park, or the park's website before you go.) However, those with diabetes are allowed to bring juice in case their blood sugar gets low.

, Pack up stuff you might need on your trip like money to spend on food. Also you might want suntan lotion if it gets too sunny. If the kids want to go to a little kids ride you don't like, you can read a book while they are riding. Make sure you have shoes that are comfortable. Theme parks are usually spread out all over the place, and they are huge.

, Use the map. If the park is far away then you should bring things to keep you and your kids and friends satisfied if you have them.

, It is best to get to the theme park early. If you do, you can find a nice parking space before everyone else takes up all the other spaces. If you're late, parking spaces are usually hard to find so you may have to wait around 40 minutes during busy times. Make sure you have something that won't make you bored while waiting.

, OR buy tickets in advance, you can save up to 25% off ticket prices if you buy ahead of time and you do not have to wait in line.

Dress comfortably.,
Be prepared for any and all weather conditions.,
Avoid valuable clothes.,
Wear clothes that breathe.,
Wear comfortable shoes and socks.",How to Dress for the Zoo," Likely, you will spend most of the day walking around to view the exhibits, so avoid wearing anything too tight or uncomfortable.


If the day is going to be warm, consider wearing loose capri pants or shorts. This way, you will not be sweating all day, and you are free to walk and run around as needed.
If the day is going to be cool, consider wearing sweatpants or loose jeans. Avoid restrictive pants, as these do not allow you to comfortably walk around, lean, and crouch to view the exhibits.;
, A summer day in Texas promises triple digits, but many zoos have air-conditioned inside portions (aquariums, reptile exhibits, etc.) for which you may want to bring a sweater or jacket, just in case. Likewise, if you visit the Franklin Park Zoo over winter break, you'll want to walk in with a coat, but after walking around in the sun for a few hours, you may want something cooler to wear. This is not to suggest that you should be changing clothes every few hours; only that since visiting the zoo is an active experience that primarily takes place outdoors, you should take caution and dress in layers.

, Don't wear anything you would mind getting splashed, dirty, or sweaty.

, Be prepared to perspire, whether or not it's going to be warm outside. You will be walking around enough to sweat a fair amount, so dress accordingly.


Aim for light, breathable fabrics, such as linen, rayon, and cotton.
Avoid heavy fabrics that will trap heat and sweat against your skin, such as wool, cashmere, and fleece.

, Most zoo visits include miles of walking, and you don't want to be caught with blisters and achy feet at the end of the day.

Start out small.,
Watch the coaster and the riders.,
Sit in the test seat.,
Sit in the middle of the train.,
Appreciate being back on the ground.",How to Enjoy a Roller Coaster1," If this is your first time riding a coaster, or if your first few times terrified you, seek out the smaller coasters. Either look at the park website ahead of time to see what they offer, look at the park map to find out the sizes, and don’t be afraid to ask someone who works at the park which roller coaster would be best for a beginner.For young riders, amusement parks often have kid-oriented coasters that give you thrill but are designed especially with kids in mind. Even if riding the child coasters isn’t an option, most parks have a range of coaster sizes so you can find one that fits you.;
, You can get a good idea of what the ride will be like by looking at the coaster’s structure, watching a couple trains go through the circuit, and watching and listening to the riders.


If the track has multiple big drops, loops, corkscrews, or other features that scare you, maybe pass on that particular coaster for now. Try to find one that seems like the right intensity for you.
If you are with friends, ask if they have ridden specific coasters and can tell you about them.
You can also ask people coming off of the ride what the experience was like for them.

, At the entrance to many roller coasters is a model of the seat featured on the ride. Before going on the coaster for the first time, try out the test seat to make sure you will be comfortable with the seat itself and the straps, pull down bars, and harnesses the seat has.If you aren’t comfortable in the test seat, you will most likely not be comfortable once the ride is fully in motion.

, Once you have decided to ride a specific roller coaster, you have to pick what part of the train you want to sit in. Each portion of the train will experience the ride a little bit differently, and even if the coaster itself is a good fit, certain parts of the train may not be right for you. For first time or inexperienced riders, the middle is the best spot to sit in because it offers the mildest ride.


Sitting in the front gives you a view of exactly where you are headed, which may seem comforting in theory but can actually be scary for first time riders.
The back of the train experiences the highest speed going down hills and tends to have the roughest ride around curves., Once you have completed the ride, your body will most likely need some time to adjust to the change of being back on solid, stable ground. To finish your ride well, take a moment to appreciate the calm of walking slowly again.You can also purposefully take some slow breaths to calm your heart down if it is still racing from the ride.
Another way to calm down is to talk to a friend about what the experience was like.

"
"
Seek new coasters.,
Change how you ride.,
Sit in new locations.,
Find new styles.,
Take one step at a time.",How to Enjoy a Roller Coaster2," If you have already ridden coasters for a while, think about what coasters you have ridden before and seek out ones similar to that. Rather than riding the same coasters you have been on many times before, new ones of similar intensity will increase your enjoyment. If you started out with a few wooden coasters and low-key steel coasters, try moving up to a more intense steel coaster.You can even use a coaster directory to explore.One thing to pay attention to is what type of seat the coaster has. Are your feet dangling? Are you standing up in the harness? You can tell a lot by the track and seats of the coaster.
If you can tell for sure it goes upside down, goes super fast or you can see huge drops, consider whether you are ready for these aspects.
Most mid-size to large parks have steel coasters that are more moderate and may be fast and high but don’t go upside down.

, If you have only been riding for a while, maybe you have spent most of that time holding onto the lap bar or harness.


Take the step of letting go and raise those hands up for the whole ride, as long as this is an option.
If you have ever kept your eyes closed before, try keeping them open and seeing all the different views along the way.
You may have noticed people tend to scream on roller coasters. This can be a fun way to release any lingering fear you may have during the ride.

, Inexperienced riders may take a seat wherever there is one open, but when you want to try some new, try choosing a seat you've never sat in before. Even if you have ridden the coaster many times, sitting in a new spot can change the ride.


Sit in the very front and see things before everyone else.
Sit in the very back for a faster and rougher ride.
Some coasters may have forward and backward facing seats, so pick a direction you haven't faced before.

, One of the most exciting aspects of roller coasters is that there are almost endless ways they are designed, specifically regarding the types of seats and how you are positioned during the ride. Trying types of coasters you’ve never experienced is kind of like riding one for the first time.


If you have never ridden a standing coaster, find a park that has one and go ride it. Never ridden one where you are hanging from the seat and facing the ground? You’ll feel just like you are flying. How about riding one that launches you at top speed or one that faces backwards?

, You might still be near the beginning of your roller coaster riding career, so you don’t have to become an all out adrenaline junkie in one trip. Try one new coaster that you were too scared of at first, or one new seat location. Don’t think that you have to tackle the whole park at once.

Reassure yourself by learning about safety standards.,
Read about how roller coasters work.,
Learn about the history of roller coasters.",How to Enjoy a Roller Coaster3," While it is true that people have been killed and injured on roller coasters, these are most commonly due to people breaking riding rules set by the park. The International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions calculates the odds of experiencing a fatal injury on a ride at fixed-site amusement parks (such as Disney, Six Flags, etc.) to be one in 750 million.Learn about what kind of safety standards parks have to follow.


Far more people are affected by car accidents than by roller coasters, but people are rarely afraid of riding in cars.
You could plan which coasters to ride before you go to the amusement park and you could specifically research those coasters to find out the safety features and what their track record is like. Park websites should include safety information.

, Understanding the design of the structure and the physics at work can reassure you of their safety. You can learn how potential and kinetic energy are at work during the ride, or about how the train is attached to and slides along the track. For example, most roller coasters are attached to the track by rollers both on top of the track and on the bottom side of the track, which makes the ride safer.The main benefit of learning about coasters is that once you know some of the physical aspects, it won’t be as mysterious to you.

, Besides the scientific aspects of roller coasters, you could also reassure yourself by learning about their long history, such as when the first one in American was built (1884!). Learn about how the earliest coasters were constructed versus new techniques used today. One of the greatest safety advancements was the implementation of computers systems that control and monitor roller coasters from the start of the ride to the finish. Other improvements to safety features include padded headrests, ratcheting safety restraints, and magnetic braking systems, all of which were designed with rider safety in mind.Visit the website of the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA) at www.iaapa.org for lots more information on safety features, regulations, and advancements.

Do not feed animals or birds.,

Let the animals stay calm.,
Be careful, obey all signage and directions from staff.,
Do not ask the zoo employees unnecessary, silly or inappropriate questions.,
Use a map or guide book to plan your route around the zoo.,
Don't push to the front of a crowd to see what's going on!,
Be aware of others taking photographs.,
Respect the animals and workers, and they will respect you in return.",How to Behave in a Zoo," Animals can become ill after they eat unsuitable food. Remember that each animal has its own ration, fed to it by the zoo workers. Do not feed the animals even if the animals seem hungry.


Sometimes, for example at Petting Zoos, food for some of the animals can be purchased so visitors can interact with the animals. This is the one time it's okay to feed zoo animals.;
, Do not make loud noises, clap your hands or attempt to scare them to get a reaction. Many animals are afraid of noise, timid and shy even though they are captive. You don't know how long some animals have been at a particular zoo or in an enclosure or they may be recovering from a injury or have a new animal in their midst. Any zoo bird or animal may be feeling uncomfortable on display on any given day so be reasonable and don't expect animals to perform for your entertainment. They are all just doing what they'd do in the wild as far as possible.
Some visitors think that if they paid money for tickets, they are allowed to do anything and see every exhibit at its peak performance. It’s not the case. A ticket only allows you to enter the zoo and look at the animals. No animal is obligated to perform tricks for you., Zoos can be risky if you don't follow the rules. Do not climb over fences. Don't try to hug animals unless a keeper says it's okay and don't try to take photos of yourself or your children with the animals from anywhere other than behind the barriers and fences.

, They are busy with their work; they are not guides. Information about animals is usually provide by their enclosure. Read about the zoo and any animals you're especially interested in before visiting the zoo. If a zoo keeper or other expert is giving a talk or demonstration at any of the enclosures, listen quietly and ask questions when invited to do so. Any joke you think of they will of heard at least 100 times so don't make any!

, If there are exhibits you don't want to miss, visit them first. Plan your route around the zoo so you don't have to rush around and so you don't find yourself heading in the opposite direction as everyone else at a peak time., Wait your turn, others will step back when they've seen what they want to. Everyone has paid the same entry fee so everyone's entitled to look at everything as long as they like. If you don't get to the lion's den at feeding time, for example, you can't expect all the people that did to step back and make room for you, or your children., Many zoo visitors like to record their trip with photos of the animals and birds. They may wait many minutes for the perfect shot just for some other oblivious visitor to walk right through their shot or, worse, allow their child to run shrieking up to the animal's enclosure for it never to be seen again that day., Enjoy your visit to the zoo!

Try not to look at a ride beforehand.,
Think positive thoughts.,
Don't hesitate when getting on.,
Don't cry or mention your fear.,
Sit by your family/friends if possible.,
Relax when the ride begins to move (unless it is an extremely fast roller coaster, such as Stealth, Speed, Rita, Formula Rossa, etc where it may be impossible to do so).,
Keep your eyes open.,
Take your time to appreciate things.,
Don't try to hate every second, try to love it.,
If the ride ends and you didn't enjoy it, you don't have to go back on.",How to Endure Roller Coasters if You Hate Them," Don't watch any on-ride or off-ride videos on YouTube and attempt not to watch the ride in motion before you get on, if at all possible. It may make you think negative thoughts such as 'I'm going to hate this' and 'Can I get on' or even 'What happens if there is an accident. You may decide not to get on. Just keep your eyes on the queue ahead.;
, Think things like 'I might love this' and 'I'll be proud of myself'. It will help you immensely, even if you don't realise it. Avoid all negative thoughts.

, Just lock yourself in and don't be inclined to move until the ride is in motion, as you might want to unlock yourself and get off. Try to ignore comments by your family or friends like 'This is going to be scary' or 'You're scared aren't you!'. They may discourage you.

, It could result in you acknowledging how much you actually are scared of roller coasters and how much you don't want to get on.

, Sitting next to a complete stranger my be unnerving, especially if they are a roller coaster fanatic, as it is not uncommon for them to make fun of and scare inexperienced riders with untrue stories and startling comments.

, Even if the ride is fast, or begins with a burst of extreme speed, remember to keep your head back and breathe normally.

, Try your best to keep them open it will help you endure the experience and see what is coming. Keeping your eyes open will reduce nausea and make your experience less terrifying.

, You might have never experienced anything this powerful or fast. This may be your only opportunity to appreciate the true speed and power of gravity, and natures forces, and of course, the ride itself.

, If you can't, then keep your mind blank and take your mind off what you're doing, and don't think about what you're actually riding or where you are. Think about what appeals to you.

, However, you will most likely be having an adrenaline rush and have a big smile on your face!

Pick the best day to visit Thorpe Park.,
Plan how you'll get to the park.,
Consider pre-ordering a Fastrack package online.",How to Avoid Queues at Thorpe Park1," When planning your visit, you'll want to consider both the month and the day of the week in order to reduce the time spent in queues as much as possible.

Go during the off-season months. The least busy months are from April to May, and from September to November. These months have reduced wait times as they are when the park has just opened/closed, schools have gone back, and there are no special events on. Avoid going to the park in peak summer months. Every day in the summer is busy, leading to queues of up to 4 hours per ride.
Visit the park during the week if possible. The best days to go are Tuesdays, Wednesdays or Thursdays, as on these days the queues are up to four times shorter since most people are in school or at work.;
, It's important to bare travel time in mind so that you'll ensure you get to the gate on time and avoid waiting in long queues there. You can get most of the way to Thorpe Park using public transit by taking a train (or another form of transportation) to Waterloo, then hopping on a train to Reading (they leave every 20 minutes), and getting off at Staines. It's about 30 - 40 minutes if you take the slow train. Once at Staines, you have a few different options:

Take the Thorpe Park Bus, which is faster than the local bus but more expensive (£3.70 for a return).
Take the local bus, which is a bit slower, but the tickets are cheaper (£2.40 return).
Walk, but keep in mind that the park is 4.8 km (3 miles) away, so it could take up to an hour to get there.

, Fastracks enable you to skip the normal queue and enter a special, shorter queue reserved for Fastrack pass holders. If you would like to purchase a Fastrack, it's a good idea to pre-order them online before you go, as the park only sells a limited amount of them each day and they often get sold out."
"
Arrive early.,
Ride your favourite rides first.,
Start at the left side of the park and work your way to the right side.,
Eat lunch very early or very late.,
Wait until later to ride the bigger rides once their queues have peaked.",How to Avoid Queues at Thorpe Park2," Whether you have pre-ordered tickets, or are getting them at the gate (with or without vouchers) make sure you get to the gate at least half an hour early. Generally queues build up about a half hour before the park opens and it remains busy until 3PM, and then they die down in the park's final opening hours of the day.

If you have an annual pass, aim to get there up to 40 minutes early. You get prioritized entrance, meaning you get to enter the park earlier then the general public, so you can be let in 15-30 minutes early. Make sure you're there right when they let you in to make the most of this time with short queues.

, Be reasonable, and imagine the park will be really busy, so choose 4 - 6 rides you really really want to do, and get them out of the way before the queues get too long. After you've ridden your favourite ones, you can then be more systematic in your choices in order to avoid queues., The public tend to swarm to the right hand side of the park, near Stealth, the Swarm and Nemesis Inferno, so do these later in the day. Try to start off over as far left as you can - the rides like Rush, Vortex, Quantum, and even Saw, Colossus or Samurai. Saw and Colossus both get queues of over 60 minutes in peak times (afternoons and weekends), so do these early., Most restaurants are open by 11:30, and the queues peak from 12:30 - 1:00, especially for popular ones such as KFC or Pizza Pasta. It's recommended to either get to the restaurant as the doors open, or wait to eat until around 2:30PM, when people are doing their final rides and starting to leave. This will pay off two-fold - you won't have to wait in long queues to get your food, and if you're on the rides while everyone else is eating lunch, the ride queues will be smaller., Once you see on the billboards of ride times dotted round the park that the big rides have reached queues of up and over 40 minutes, stop joining these big queues and head for the ones with smaller queues instead. Wait until later on in the day, when people are starting to go home and the queues are dying down, to ride these big rides."

Check out the most intense coasters.",How to Ride a Roller Coaster," There are loads of different varieties, intensities, and styles of roller coasters, and deciding what kind of experience you want out of riding a roller coaster is an important first step. Some riders prefer old-school wooden coasters for a vintage feel, while others will prefer newer, super-fast, upside-down behemoths to test their mettle. The choice is completely up to you, but it's good to get some sense of what to expect from different kinds of coasters.



Wooden roller coasters are the oldest and most classic types of coasters, and usually the kind you'll want to start on. They're operated with a traditional chain-lift mechanism, in which the cars are lifted to a peak and dropped to allow gravity to force the cars through the rest of the turns and valleys at high speed. It's also a fun and bumpy ride. These usually won't go upside down. The Texas Giant, the American Eagle at Six Flags America, and the Beast at King's Island are all examples of classic wooden coasters. Also, Thunderbolt is a common name for wooden coasters.

Steel roller coasters feature complex steel tracks, offering somewhat smoother rides and more maneuverability, as well as the ability to invert the riders, incorporating loops, corkscrews, and all kinds of other exciting motions. Most modern roller coasters, including the classic Kingda Ka, the Millennium Force, Steel Dragon 2000 and the Storm Coaster are steel coasters.;
, Not all roller coasters are designed the same way, and some are a bit more comfortable for first-time riders than others. Knowing a bit about the different types will help you pick the right one. For the beginner, traditional seated car roller coasters are typically the best way to get an introduction to the ride. They're comfortable, safe, and relatively simple.


Floorless coasters, for example, allow the riders' legs to hang free, simulating an intense falling experience, while standing coasters lock the riders in place in an upright position.
Wing coasters feature two cars that extend on either side of the track, giving your individual car the impression of floating, while suspended coasters are able to swing back and forth freely as the coaster goes around bends.

, If you're inexperienced at riding roller coasters, the best way to get your sea legs is to ride a smaller version of a coaster. Most parks have a variety of different types of roller coasters, and they're all fun. Smaller coasters will usually have less-intense drops, no loops, and will still give you a good thrill, going at high speeds. Often, they'll have shorter lines, too, which gives you less time to get nervous while you wait.


Alternatively, depending on your temperament, it might be better to jump in the deep end and ride an intense roller coaster to get it over with. That way, you'll know you've been through the wildest of the wild and you don't need to be scared anymore.

, At the beginning of most roller coasters should be a measuring stick with a minimum height requirement for all riders. This isn't to punish enthusiastic kids who want to ride the big rides, but to ensure the safety of all the riders. The seats and safety harnesses need to be big enough to fit everyone, so kids and especially short people run the risk of slipping through the harness.


Don't sneak past the height requirement and then wait in line. Typically, before you jump in the car, the park employees will measure you with a height stick and send off anyone who doesn't meet the mark. It would be too bad to have waited around for two hours just to get rejected at the last second.
Most roller coasters feature warnings that pregnant rides, riders with heart conditions, and other physical ailments should not ride certain roller coasters. Most of these warnings will be featured at the beginning of the line, next to the height requirement. Don't ride if you have any concerns about your physical health.

, One great way to pick a roller coaster is to pick one that doesn't have an insanely long line. Very popular roller coasters will often have waits for up to two or three hours, depending on the ride and the park, so it's important to manage your time if you want to ride some roller coasters. It might be worth it to wait several hours for one big one, or you might rather spend your time riding other rides.


Bring something to do in line, or some friends to talk with. Waiting that long can be awfully boring, and might be a lot more fun with a book or some buddies to goof off with. Be respectful and polite to everyone else in line who's waiting with you.
Some theme parks also have fast passes, which allow you to show up to a ride at a designated time, skip the line, and hop right on the ride. This allows you to more efficiently use your time at the park, though these passes are more expensive than a regular ticket.

, On lots of roller coasters, the line will split once you get toward the end of it, to line up for different seats along the car. Once in the loading zone, pick the row you wish to ride in, and get in that line. Any of the cars are great choices for your first rides.


Some people love the front for the view, while others love the back for what is called the ""goat effect,"" a phenomenon named after the Thunder Mountain roller coaster at Disneyland. Toward the back of the cars, the g-forces exerted on the riders are stronger, making the experience more intense, making up for the lack of view.
If you don't have much of an opinion or preference, head to the shortest line to get on the ride the quickest. Less waiting, less nerves, more fun.

, It should be common sense, but all the excitement of the park and the availability of giant elephant ears and turkey legs can cause some riders to forget: roller coasters can make some people puke. The g-forces on certain coasters are strong, and the feeling of weightlessness can cause stomach butterflies and sometimes nausea in certain riders. For most of us, that feeling will subside and will actually be part of the fun, but if you've got a belly full of Dip-in-Dots, it might end up all over the car behind you. Don't eat right before going on a coaster. Treat yourself to something after you ride, to reward yourself for your bravery.


It's also a good idea to make sure you go to the bathroom before getting in line. You don't want to wait around for 2 hours to ride the Vortex and then find out you've got to go right before getting on and strapping in. That could get ugly.

, On most roller coasters, a metal harness should be raised above your seat, which you can pull down and lock into place. If you can't figure it out, don't worry too much, because a ride employee walk down the cars and check every rider by tugging on your harness before the ride takes off. Listen carefully to any instructions given over PA speakers or by the employees. There's no way they'll let you leave without checking your safety buckle, so relax and remain calm.


All seats and safety locks are different, so if you have trouble figuring yours out, just wait until the employee comes along and ask for assistance. More elaborate safety harnesses will usually be locked in by the park employees. If you suspect something might be wrong with your safety harness, tell a park employee immediately.
Make sure you feel comfortable. Roller coasters are bumpy and you'll likely be jostled around in your seat, which is part of the fun. If you don't feel comfortable in the seat, though, that can make the bumps pretty irritating. It might be a rough ride. If something about your seat is uncomfortable, communicate with a ride employee, or restate yourself before the harness is locked in., Before the ride takes off, it's important to stow anything you might lose while going very fast in an open-top roller coaster. Sandals, hats, glasses, and necklaces in particular are often sacrificed to the roller coaster, and it can be very difficult to retrieve these items if you lose them somewhere along the way.


Always remove your glasses and keep them in your pocket. It's a good idea to give this some thought before you get all the way into the seat and are about to blast off.
If you're wearing a baseball cap, it's sometimes enough to turn it backwards if it fits snugly enough, but sometimes it's a safer idea to remove it and hold it, stuff it in a cargo pocket, or leave it with someone on the ground.

, As you're sitting and waiting for things to get moving, the nerves will probably start to kick in. If you've never ridden before, it's common to start suspecting that something is wrong, getting paranoid about every noise you hear and every little jostle. Everything you're experiencing is perfectly normal. Try your best to remain calm and enjoy the fun of the adrenaline. Roller coasters are very safe and reliable structures.


Hold on tight and don't let go unless you feel comfortable. Most roller coasters provide little hand-grips that can help to relieve some of the stress and allow you to feel like you're in more control of the situation. Grab on and have fun!
Don't wiggle around or struggle with the harness after the ride starts. In a given year, several people will be injured on roller coasters, it's true. But roughly 300 million people ride roller coasters safely each year without incident.The overwhelming majority of injuries are the result of rider error and rule breaking, messing with the harnesses, or sneaking onto the ride against the rules. If you follow the rules and sit calmly, you'll be fine.

, Roller coasters are a great communal experience. Going alone on an empty car would be a dull ride. One of the most fun things about the roller coaster is listening to everyone laugh, scream, shout funny comments, and go through the whole ride together. If you're with close friends on a beautiful day at the park, riding a roller coasters can be extremely fun.


Friends can also help keep the experience light and distracting. If you're too busy goofing off with your friends, you won't have to spend time being worried about what's to come while you're waiting in line. Just focus on having fun.
Don't get goaded into riding roller coasters you're not ready for by ambitious friends. If all your friends want to ride on the super-scary looking seven-looper and you're not into it, go on other rides in the meantime and meet up later.

, Most roller coasters have one thing in common, a long, slow build up to the first massive hill and the first big drop. Classic roller coasters all have the opening drop, and once you get that out of the way, the rest of the ride is just fast and fun. If you're feeling nervous, just get that out of the way and you'll be in for a treat.


The long, slow pull up to the first drop is one of the scariest parts of the ride, because nothing is actually happening and it's painfully slow. Try to enjoy it for the anticipation it builds. It'll all be over soon.
Some riders who get really scared like to close their eyes, but that actually make it a little more nauseating if you can't see what's coming up. If you can, Try to keep your eyes open to stay aware of your surroundings. It'll be more fun that way.

, When you coast over that first big hill, a lot of people will probably start shouting with glee. Join them! There are few times in life you get the chance to really let loose with a howl of total delight like when you ride a roller coaster. Your adrenaline will be pumping and it's a great time to let out a primal scream.


It's also true that screaming in a group can trigger the release of oxytocin, a hormone that soothes and calms the body, in certain conditions.This means that screaming can actually help calm you down and produce feelings of euphoria.

, If you've gotten over your first coaster, congratulations! Now the real fun begins. More often than not, most people who start to ride coasters want to get right back in line immediately. The rush from a good roller coaster is like nothing else in the world. And what's better? Riding the same roller coaster you just rode, but backwards. If you find one you really like, you can experience it for the first time all over again, going backwards.


Many roller coasters will be run forward for most of the day and run backward at a certain hour. Find out at the park near the front of the line what the schedule for running is, or just look at the track closely to see if they're running it backward.
Some roller coasters always run forward and backward, using two tracks that run simultaneously. The Racer at King's Island is a classic example of a backward-running roller coaster classic.

, Launched coasters start off with a bang, using hydraulic pressure to immediately launch the cars from a standing position into a fast speed, sometimes as high as 60 or 80 mph (97 or 129 km/h), giving you little time to brace yourself, but it also helps to get it over with quickly. These will often go upside down, corkscrew, and do other fun twists and turns. Space Mountain at Disney World is possibly the most famous example of this variety of coaster.

, Next challenge? Doing a loop. The first time you go upside down on a roller coaster is a big moment for a lot of people, but it seems way more intimidating than it turns out to be, and twice as fun. You'll be weightless for a quick second and it'll be over with. Roller coasters that feature loops are often long and elaborate, or fast and intense, with lots of crazy maneuvers. If you've braved a traditional roller coaster, start upping the ante.


What rattles most people during their initial rides isn't actually the drops or the nausea, but being jostled around. Doing loops is one of the smoother parts of riding a roller coaster, most times, so it's not something that should scare you off of taking a ride on one.

, The Olympics of the theme park? Riding every coaster in one day. It's possible, if you break up your time effectively and are willing to wait in long lines. Going about your mission with some planning will also likely help. By the end, you might be a full-blown coaster addict.


To make it, Try to hit the longer lines earlier in the day, when they'll likely be shorter, and to make sure you'll have enough time. Then, the less popular rides will be open to you in the afternoon.

, If you're on your way to becoming a full-blown adrenaline junkie and roller coaster addict, it's time to start checking out the biggest and the baddest coasters in the world and seeking them out. Some of the most intense, fastest, highest, and longest roller coasters include:


Formula Rossa in Abu Dhabi
Takabisha at the Fuji-Q Highland
Kingda Ka at Six Flags Great Adventure
El Toro and Nitro at Six Flags Great Adventure
The Colossus at Heide Park
Full Throttle and X2 at Six Flags Magic Mountain
Superman (Formerly Bizarro) and Goliath at Six Flags New England
Boulder Dash and Phobia at Lake Compounce

Acquire something which has pages.,
Examine the layout of the pages.,
Open the book.,
Place the book on its spine, either in your hand, on a flat surface or other area so that the cover is facing downwards and the open pages upwards.,
Grip the edge of the right page (or left if you're reading some foreign texts) with your thumb slipped under the page and index finger on top if you're using your left hand, or your thumb on top and your index finger slipped underneath if you're using your right, grasping it from either side.,
Push off the side of the book with your thumb so that the page you are grasping is slightly raised from the other pages.

,
Move your hand, with the page still firmly between your thumb and finger, towards the left side.,
Drop the page by releasing the grip your thumb and index finger have on the page.,
Repeat the process if you wish; this is usually done when you are actually reading the book in order to continue the story on multiple pages.,
Congratulations!",How to Turn a Page," It doesn't matter what type; if it has pages, you can turn them! Not just books have pages: magazines, leaflets, calendars, they all have pages to turn. Once you have a book, you're ready to begin.;
, With most books, the pages turn over to the left side. However, some books and indeed calendars have pages the turn upwards and some foreign texts write right to left, so the pages may turn to the right, opposite to those of the western world. Making sure you have the book the right way up is also a good idea.

, To do this, put your hands on either side of the book, place your thumbs roughly in the middle of the side that's facing towards you and separate them, gripping the book as you go; this will cause the book to part and the book to be now open. Normally you would want to start from the beginning of the book, where the story often begins, but to learn how to turn a page, you can start anywhere in the book.

, This makes it much easier to turn pages because of gravity and hold your position in the book.

, You now have the page in your control and can move it with ease. This is the precursor to turning the page.

,, Do this far enough so the you can see the reverse side and can no longer see the front.

, If you have moved the page over far enough, gravity should take hold and drop the page down on the left side of the book.

, This can only be done so many times before the book ends with the back cover; you can turn this as well which will mean that you have closed the book.

, You've successfully turned a page; if you want to close the book you can either follow step 3 in reverse by gripping the edges of the book covers and moving your hands together so that the two sides meet. When there is no space in the middle, the book has been closed. Similarly, you can continue to turn pages until the back cover has been turned to the left, therefore closing the book.

Store books long-term in plastic bins.,
Find an appropriate space for storing your bins of books.,
Keep books in rooms with relatively low humidity.,
Keep books away from direct heat.,
Reduce exposure to direct light.,
Store books upright or flat.,
Protect books from bookworms.,
Store rare books in custom sleeves.,
Consider finding a conservator for very rare items.",How to Store Books1," If you've got more books than you know what to do with, the best place to store them is in opaque plastic tubs that you can seal and store in a cool location. Plastic tubs help to protect books from sunlight, rodents, and other conditions, and are easy to stack in out-of-the-way locations. If you don't need to access your books regularly, plastic tubs are a good choice.


Most retailers sell a variety of storage bins, in various sizes. Try to get relatively small boxes, no bigger than 12 x 12 in., or the bins will become quite heavy.
It's fine to store these books anywhere the temperature will be consistent and cool. Attics and garages will be fine in certain climates. Polyurethane plastic tubs should protect books adequately from insects and rodents who might chew up books.;
, Got more books than you've got shelves? Finding a spot for all those old paperbacks can be tough. But with the right storage techniques, you can find places for them.


Store book bins underneath the bed, at the backs of closets, or in the basement. Try to store books indoors, if you can. Exposed attic spaces, sheds, and garages can have drastic temperature swings, which can be rough on the binding and paper.
Consider renting a storage space in your town for storing books. If you have a lot of books, an indoor storage facility might be temperature-controlled and appropriate for some old boxes of books, while outdoor garages might be fine for your old paperbacks.

, In very hot climates, books can start to warp. Ideally, you should keep the relative humidity around 35%. Humidity causes binding to warp, paper to curl, and books to suffer. Ideally, you want to keep your books stored long-term in a climate-controlled room, kept around 35% humidity. Good dry air circulation is good for books.


Anything lower than 50-60% should be ok for most books, but rare or valuable books should always be stored around 35%, indoors. If you're really particular about keeping your books safe, though, Try to keep it even lower if possible.

, Books stored close to heat ducts, hot appliances, and other sources of direct heat can become warped. To protect the binding of your books, keep them stored in relatively cool temperatures. In most climates, a room temperature of 60-75 degrees is perfectly fine.


If you're concerned about the distribution of heat in a particular room and the safety of your books, rotate them regularly to make sure a handful of books aren't getting more exposed than others.

, Soft room lighting won't affect the quality of books much. But hard, direct sunlight will always serve to bleach out and damage the binding and the page-quality of books. Rooms in which books are kept should be shady, with drapes over the windows to protect the books.

, The best way to store books? Flat on their back, or standing up on their ""tail,"" the bottom edge of the book. This means the books is stored standing upright, so you can read the spine correctly. Books are designed to be stored in this way, and can be supported by other books, helping to keep them stable and safe.


Never store books with the binding or spine pointing up. This will always crack the hinge, which will affect the life of the book.

, Certain types of book binding glue and paper are often an attractive snack for cockroaches, silverfish, various beetles and other insects.In most conditions, you won't have to worry much about protecting your books from infestation, but it's still a good idea to keep food and crumbs out of the book room to keep insects from coming in.

, Very rare books, or books that you're concerned about keeping safe from infestation should be stored in plastic sleeves. Custom enclosures are also available at most rare book stores, made to fit the specific volumes you've got.If you find that some of your books have been infested with insects, the best way to clean them out is to place them in plastic bags and put them in the freezer for several hours to kill the bugs, then clean them thoroughly. Read the next section for more information about cleaning books properly.

, If you have some first editions or especially rare books that you're concerned bout taking care of yourself, consider enlisting a professional to care for your books for you.Museums, libraries, and private rare book collectors may be a better place for those items than the garage.


The American Institute for Conservation (AIC)collects rare artistic and historical works, and offers a variety of conservators you can enlist to guide you through the process of caring for them."

Use a small hand-vac in the hinges.,
Vacuum the room regularly.",How to Store Books2," The number one enemy of books? Dirt and natural oils from your hands as you handle them.When you're handling your books, make sure to wash your hands with warm, soapy water, and thoroughly dry them before picking up and thumbing through your books, or cleaning them.


Very old, leather-bound, or rare books should be handled while wearing latex gloves. Never eat or drink around old books that you want to protect.

, Books need to be cleaned regularly to keep dust from accumulating on them. Generally, unless books become very soiled, basic dusting and proper temperature and environment control should be enough to keep them clean long-term.


Start dusting by removing all the books from your shelves and cleaning the shelves thoroughly, dusting them and wiping them down before reshelving the books., The best way to clean old books is with a microfiber cloth that traps dust inside. Instead of just blowing the dust around, as with a feather duster, these types of cloths will trap the dust and remove it completely. They've commonly sold at most home retail stores.


Don't use water or other solvents to Try to clean books. If you have a very rare book that's gotten dirty, take it to a book dealer in your area and talk about restoration methods. Most books should not need to be cleaned in any way other than gentle dusting., If you're storing books upright on the shelf, most books will only be dusty or dirty at the top of the cover, and on the top binding of the book. The bottoms will usually be mostly clean. When you're cleaning then, start at the top, wiping down gently with the cling-cloth and wiping dust from the book.

, If your books are very dusty, it may be good to use a small hand-vac, or the tube function on your regular vacuum cleaner to gently suck the dust out of the hinge in the binding. Run the vacuum over the top of the books while they're still stacked to get the most dust out of there, before you go back over them individually with a cloth. This can be a good way to get the worst out of the way first.

, Most of the dust in a book room will be tracked in from the floor, actually. While dusting the shelves themselves is important, paying attention to cleaning the room regularly will help to keep your books in their prime condition. Vacuum and sweep the floors at least once a week, if your books are in a high-traffic area, to keep your books from needing more substantial cleaning.

Pick an appropriate book shelf.,
Display books in stacked crates.,
Store your children's books in wall-mounted theme bins.,
Shelve books according to genre.,
Arrange your books by size and shape.,
Arrange your books alphabetically.,
Arrange books by color.",How to Store Books3," The best, most organized, and most secure way to store books is on shelves designed for the purpose. Its clean, accessible, and allows you to easily peruse the books that you have quickly. They're available at most home retailers and are always a good choice.


Natural, pre-treated wood and sheet metal are the best surfaces on which to store books. Storing books on shelves with synthetic paint or other chemicals can leech into the binding and paper, affecting the quality of the items., One more quirky and off-kilter way to store and access your books is to line them up in a series of stacked wooden crates. Old milk crates or other boxes of various sizes can be reclaimed, then stacked in various patterns to fit the space that you have.


Stack book crates on the side, rather than bottom-up, so you can stack your books as if they were in a bookshelf. This makes them easy to access and peruse.
Think of it as a DIY bookshelf. Crates allow you to organize your books into micro genres, keeping your cookbooks in one crate and your novels in another, putting them in adjacent spaces and rooms if necessary. They're also movable.

, One creative idea with your stacks of children books is to purchase or fashion a wooden cut of an animal, dinosaur, or other kids-themed shape, and mount it on the wall. To it, affix small shelves or baskets in which you can store books at a child-appropriate height. This is a great way to lively up your kids' room and organize all their books.

, If you've got a lot of books, one of the most user-friendly ways to organize them is by genre. Keep your novels with your novels, your non-fiction with your non-fiction, and other genres together. Get as specific as you want, for the books that you have.


Within genre, you can specialize even further if you want to. In the history section, store your military history books together, but differentiate them from your natural history books, European history, and other sub-genres.
If you don't have a lot of different genres, just split them into two big categories: Fun books and learning books. Put all novels, stories, and sci-fi in the first section. Put all your old school stuff in the other.

, Want to make sure your books look nice on the shelf? Group them according to their relative size and shape, to keep your shelves, stacks, or crates looking organized. Keep very tall and thin books with other very tall and thin books, and keep very squat and short books with other like books.


Aside from looking nice and organized, books can be supported better if they're stacked next to books of a similar size. This helps to stabilize the covers and the binding.

, If you've got more of a linear mind, it might make more sense to you to categorize your books alphabetically, for easy reference. This may look a little more chaotic on the shelf, and you'll end up with some weird stuff next to one another, but you'll always know where everything is in the alphabet.


Go by title, or go by the last name of the author when you're alphabetizing your books. Generally, titles are easier to remember, but you'll also end up with a lot of titles that start with ""The"" and ""A,"" which might be confusing.

, If you've got an eye for design, organizing your books according to the color of the binding can be an excellent way to give your room a pop of particular color, and make your book shelves really stand out. Group them according to specific colors and put them on the shelf in subtle gradations, moving from one color to the next.

,, Instead of that, use a simple bookmark. You don't need to buy a fancy bookmark, an old piece of carton or anything thin clean and solid helps.

, Or take a break eat and drink then wash your hands. This doesn't mean you can't eat before reading, just remember to wash your hands before even touching your book.

, Only allow someone you trust VERY well to read the book next to you. Even if you trust someone you can't just give your book to him/her to read it in his/her place. There are other people in his place too, Do you know or trust them?

, Standing position seems more practical and logical to you. In fact by time if your book was in standing position, the glue on your book will be tiered and its papers will come off.

Learn how the Dewey Decimal System works.,
Remember that the purpose of call numbers is to group books of the same subject together, and is comprised of at least two parts: the Class number (000 through 900) and the cutter number.,
Get a feel for how a classification is broken down.",How to Shelve Books in a Library1," Learning the system is not difficult because it is logically organized and built on a decimal base. Essentially, every class of book is assigned a category number (a whole number, such as 800) and a cutter number or numbers (numbers to the right of the decimal point). These are the numbers you see on the spine of a library book, and they are referred to as the call number. The system is comprised of ten classes, which are further divided into 10 more subcategories, and each of those subcategories contains 10 subdivisions. The 10 main classes of the Dewey Decimal System are:


000—Computer science, information and general works
100—Philosophy and psychology
200—Religion
300—Social Sciences
400—Language
500—Science
600—Technology and applied science
700—Arts and recreation
800—Literature
900—History and geography;
, The class number is a whole number and the cutter number(s) are placed after the decimal point.

, Here is a short example of how you would find or shelve a book about American fiction literature written between 1861 and 1900. (The broad classification for literature is “800.”)


Look at the second number after the “8.” The number “1” indicates that the book is further classified as “American literature in general.” The second number after the “8” further defines the division; 811 is American poetry, 812 is American Drama, 813 is American fiction, 814 is American essays and so on.
Look at the first number after the decimal point; this number refines the classification even further. Thus, a book with a call number of “813.4,” tells you that the book is American fiction written between 1861 and 1900. Obviously, the more numbers, the more specific the subject.

Always use your own judgment.",How to Overcome Your Fear of Roller Coasters," It's a good idea to learn a little about roller coasters before you ride your first ones. Specific parks will usually rank the roller coasters on intensity, so you can learn more about the particular roller coasters you're going to visit when you get there and get the park map, or you can check out the specific coasters online.


Wooden roller coasters are the oldest and most classic coasters. Usually operated on chain-lifts, they'll go very fast, but never go upside down or in complicated loops, for the most part. Steel-track roller coasters are much more complex, featuring lots of twists and turns, often upside down. But some steel coasters are good because they will have more turns and not as many drops. They will also be less rickety and smoother than wooden ones. There are some small steel coasters which are great for first time as wooden coasters are very bumpy.
If you're scared of the big drops, look for a roller coaster with a curved drop instead of a straight drop, so you'll get a gradual ride and won't feel as if you're plunging. You can also choose a launched ride, which accelerates you at high speeds instead of dropping you off of a large hill, though these are just as intense in some cases. It may seem silly, but most kid rides allow anyone to ride, and can be a great start.
Try not to find out specific things like how tall the coaster is, how fast it goes, and other specific ""scary"" numbers. It is a good idea, though, to check out the twists and turns so you can brace your body and know what to expect from the ride and avoid rides that do stuff you're intimidated by. Find these things out after you ride so you can tell others and be proud of yourself.;
, Millions of people ride roller coasters every year and have a blast doing it. There's little to fear from the roller coaster, and lots of fun to be had. Talking about it with enthusiasts is a great way to get interested and excited in roller coasters for yourself. Also talk to people who were scared but now love them as it will help you see what you should ride.


Talk to family and friends, as well as park employees at the gate who enjoy roller coasters. Ask them what rides at the park are the smoothest or the tamest, and which ones to avoid. Another good idea is to ask people what their first roller coaster experience was. You can get a good idea of what to avoid on your first ride.
Read online about the good coasters at the park you're going to visit. Try to watch youtube videos on anything you think you may go on to see if they seem tame enough for you.

, If you're feeling scared by the idea of a 12-story drop going 60 mph (97 km/h), that's perfectly normal. That means the theme park is doing its job! Roller coasters are made to be scary to give riders fun thrills and chills, but they aren't actually dangerous as long as you follow the safety precautions and listen to instructions. A coaster is thoroughly tested before being cleared for public use, and all the rides receive regular maintenance to keep them in top working order. You needn't fear malfunction at professional parks.


Some injuries are reported each year from riding a roller coaster, but the vast majority of those injuries are the result of rider error and rule-breaking. If you listen to instructions and stay seated, you'll be fine. Statistically-speaking, you've run a greater risk of injury by driving to the theme park than riding the roller coaster.The chance of fatal injury on a roller coaster is 1 in 1.5 billion., Riding roller coasters should be fun, and it'll always be a lot easier with friends to cheer you on, scream together, and support each other through it. Some people find it more comfortable with a person who is also scared so you both can scream your guts out, and you won't feel left out. Others like going with someone who has already been on the coaster, and could reassure you'll be okay.


Don't go with people who will push you to do things you don't want to do. When you find your limit, don't ride anything bigger unless you are ready to push your limits. It doesn't matter what everyone thinks of you if you've found your comfort zone and want to stay in it. Don't let anybody try to push you around or pressure you into riding rides you aren't comfortable with yet.

, The average roller coaster is usually shorter than a television commercial. In some cases, you'll wait in line for 2,000% more time than you'll be on the ride. The drops, although very big, will be over in the time it takes you to take a breath. Try to remember that the whole thing, for better or worse, will be over extremely quickly. The wait is the big source of fear and anticipation, and the ride is the fun part.

, Before you wait in line, make sure you meet the height requirements listed at the start of the ride and that you're not physically unfit to ride. Typically, people with heart disorders, people who are pregnant, and people with other physical disabilities are not permitted to ride roller coasters.

, It's probably not a good idea to jump straight onto Kingda Ka or Smiler. Older wooden coasters with small-medium drops and no loops are usually a good bet for first-timers and those who want to try out coasters without getting scared. Spend time looking around the park, checking out a couple of roller coasters to find the less-scary ones.Ride some other exciting rides first to get your adrenaline up and to get used to the sensations. While roller coasters might seem like a big deal, they're not usually much more scary than other types of rides. If you can handle the Scrambler, you've got a roller coaster on lockdown.

, As you're walking around the park, as you're waiting in line, as you're getting ready to get on, Try to resist the urge to look up at the big drop or the scariest part of the ride. Focus on talking to your friends and distracting yourself from what's about to happen. There's no sense in getting worked up looking at the big drops now when you're on the ground. Think about other things and keep your mind off it.


When you're waiting in line, focus on looking at all the people getting off the ride at the end, not on the scary drops and loops. They all look, probably, like they had a blast, and they all came out just fine. So will you.

, If it is your first time on a pretty scary one, the best place to sit is in the middle, so you can focus on the back of the seat in front of you and don't have to worry too much about what's coming, but you can still see if you want to. The middle offers the gentlest place in the ride.


Alternatively, you might want to sit in the front so you can see, if it makes you feel better. Not knowing what's coming is scarier for some people.
Don't sit in the back-most seats, which exert stronger g-forces during the sharp turns and the drops. The ride feels more intense when you're sitting near the back of the cars.

, As you approach your seat and sit down in the car, listen closely to verbal instructions and follow directions from the employees. Different roller coasters use different types of safety harnesses, so you'll have to listen closely to make sure you get into them correctly.


When you sit in your seat, make sure it feels comfortable and that the safety harness comes down across your lap snugly. If you can't reach it, or if the harness is especially complicated, wait for the park helper's instructions. If you lock it in yourself, they'll still come around and check to make sure everything is solid.
When you've got your harness on, sit back and relax. Stow any glasses, or loose jewelry that you might have on in your pockets, and take some deep breaths. You'll be fine!

, Keep your head secure and back against the seat rest in your chair, and Try to focus on the track in front of you, or the back of the seat front in front of you. Don't look down or focus on things to the side, which can emphasize the speed at which you're traveling and increase any feelings of disorientation and nausea. Don't look down, in other words.


This is especially helpful if you're going on a loop. Look straight ahead and focus on the track and you'll only feel a slight feeling of weightlessness that should actually be pretty pleasant and should pass in a moment or two.
Resist the urge to close your eyes. Inexperienced riders often think that closing your eyes will help make it less scary and that you'll feel better, but closing your eyes will lead to feelings of disorientation and can make you feel nauseated. Focus on something stationary and don't close your eyes.

, Don't hold your breath on roller coasters or you might become light-headed and everything will be worse. As you're nearing the big drop, take deep breaths and Try to focus on your breathing instead of other things. This can help to center you and calm you down, focusing on a little thing. Just breathe in and breathe out. It'll be fun.


To help you focus, count your breaths as you take them. Breathe in deeply for a count for four, then tense your muscles for a count of three, then blow your breath out for a count of four. Continue cycling in this way to calm your nerves.

, At some point in the ride, you'll start to feel some butterflies, probably sooner rather than later. That's part of the fun of the roller coaster, but it can be a little overwhelming for some people. To ease it slightly, you can tense up your stomach muscles and your arms by grasping the hand-holds provided for you on the harness and the chair, to Try to keep calm.


On a roller coaster, adrenaline will be released in large amounts, triggering your fight or flight impulses. Your blood pressure will rise, you'll sweat some, and your breathing will quicken. Your vision should also sharpen and you'll be ready for action. You can alleviate this slightly by tensing your muscles, communicating to your body that it can chill out a little.

, Lots of rides will up the scare-factor by including all sorts of scary paint and dark lights and little animatronic animals or goblins along the side of the ride to scare you. If you're mostly scared of the physical sensations, these can serve to totally throw you off and make the whole thing a lot worse, so you're better off ignoring them as much as possible. If things are shooting off or moving, just stare straight ahead and don't worry about it. Keep breathing.


Alternatively, some rides with a story-line can help to distract you. If you get caught up in it, just stay focused on the fun of the story and stop worrying about the ride being scary.

, You definitely won't be the only one, and the train is usually noisy anyway with people cracking jokes and yelling back and forth. Instead of just being quiet with fear, screaming can actually make the ride more fun. Also you can also mix your screaming with some ""Woo hoos"". Screaming can take away the scariness and make you want to laugh.

, If you're still freaking out, try to use your mind to go elsewhere. Imagine that you're flying somewhere on a ship, or that you're being whisked away to Batman's lair, or that you're the one doing the driving. Anything to take your mind momentarily off the dips and the drops can help to distract you from what's happening and make the whole thing go faster.


Get pumped up and be a beast. Pretend that you're an unleashed kraken or some kind of dragon on the high rides. If you have the feeling of power, you will feel less tension and your mind will think of something else.
Some riders like to have a mantra, or a little bit of a song that they use to chant during the ride. Keep the melody to ""Reflection (Mulan, 1998)"" or ""Poker Face (Lady Gaga)"" in mind and just focus on the words instead of how you're feeling. Or just recite something simple, like, ""I'm gonna be fine, I'm gonna be fine.""

, If a ride doesn't seem safe to you, or if the employees seem unconcerned about safety, or if you've heard about previous incidents or safety concerns, don't ride that roller coaster, especially if it's going to fill you with anxiety. Most rides at large parks are expensive pieces of machinery that are well maintained and tested regularly.


A roller coaster's track is typically inspected each day before the ride is run for the first time, and will be closed down if a problem is detected.If a ride has been closed frequently over the past couple of weeks, it might be best to avoid it. The chances of an undetected problem are slight, but it might make you feel better to skip the ride.

Try to leave a small gap between your hip and the restraint.,

Put your arms forward, and your legs forward out straight.,
When you are going up, look up.",How to Be Brave on 'Rush' at Thorpe Park2," This enables you to get massive airtime on the peaks of the swings, where you drift weightlessly in your seat.

, If you look at it, the arm nearest the entrance tends to swing lower and less then the other. Ask the ride host to go on the further arm.

, This makes your body easier to move round in the seat, again, giving you more airtime.

, When you are facing down, look down. This gives you a nervous sensation of adrenaline through your body and makes the ride experience more thrilling, as it feels like you are hanging in mid-air and are about to crash back down to the floor.

Shake any excess water from the book.,
Remove dirt or debris.,
Gently apply pressure using a clean, white towel.,
Wipe down and blot the front and back cover.",How to Repair a Wet Book1," Blotting is best done with a book that has not been completely waterlogged. If your book has encountered a spill or fallen into a puddle, pick it up by its spine, and shake any remaining water from the pages and spine with a gentle side-to-side motion. When done carefully, blotting can minimize fading and wrinkling.;
, Carefully remove debris left behind from the water. This could be soggy leaves from a puddle or a candy wrapper from a water ring. Whatever the case may be, remove debris to avoid further damaging the paper you are drying.To remove debris from a damp book, remove it with your fingers or a pair of tweezers.
To remove debris from a waterlogged book, gather a large tub of clean, fresh water, and gently dip the book into the water, removing it slowly. This will pull the debris free without risking damage to the already-wet pages.

, Blot each page gently, using a clean white cloth, or a white paper towel. Moving the cloth side-to-side can tear wet pages. Blot each page gently and carefully before moving on to the next.If the pages are only slightly damp, you can place the rag between each page. If the pages are entirely waterlogged, however, blot any pages stuck together as a single page.

, For a paperback cover, blotting is safest, as you still run the risk of ripping the paper. A hardback book may be wiped down, though the movement still needs to be light and gentle. Because the covers are more durable and hardier than the individual pages of the book, they do not need to be tended to as quickly.

Do not neglect the cover. Once you’ve finished drying, make sure you dry the covers thoroughly, as leaving water on the cover could damage the book’s binding and encourage mold growth.

Allow it to dry.",How to Rebind a Book1," Approximately half an inch (1 cm) from the spine of the book, use a utility knife to cut into the cover's book cloth on both the front and the back. Avoid cutting along the hinges, as these connect the cover to the text block. You can then take the bone folder and gently pry the spine off of the book.;
, Either measure the spine that you just removed, or measure the space between the hinges on your textblock. Cut a piece of cardboard or Bristol board to match this measurement.

, Select a sturdy piece of cotton or linen fabric that matches the current cover of your book. Measure it to equal the size of the spine, and then add an additional inch to the length and two inches to the width. Cut the fabric out in this shape.

, Cover the back of your spine with book binding glue, and center it over the book cloth. Cut the corners of the fabric off at 45 degree angles, and add glue to the bottom edge of the board. Fold the top and bottom of the book cloth over and press it into the spine.

, Using the utility knife, chip away as much of the old spine's glue as you can from the text block. You want the new spine to have a clean start, so make sure it sticks by properly preparing the space it will fit.

, Place the book with the spine edge facing up. Use bricks to hold it in place. Glue a spine liner paper to the pages of the book.

, Put glue on the exposed book cloth of the new spine. Carefully drape the new spine over the book. Starting from the spine, push the book cloth onto the cover. Use a bone folder to remove any air bubbles. Wrap the book cloth around the top and bottom of the original cover.

, Place the finished book into a book press overnight to dry. Place a piece of waxed paper inside the cover to prevent the pages from sticking."

Go on progressively bigger rides.,
Don’t eat beforehand.,
Understand the safety features.,
Know what to expect.,
Watch the kids laughing and smiling after getting off the roller coaster.,
Chat with your friends as you wait.",How to Be Brave on Your First Big Roller Coaster1," One way to build your confidence before going on a big roller coaster is to go on smaller rides and work your way up to the big one. Going on smaller rides will get you familiar with the sensation of being on a roller coaster so that you won’t be overwhelmed or scared on the bigger ride.Try to go on roller coasters with similar elements as the big roller coaster. For instance, if the big roller coaster has multiple upside down loops, try to go on a roller coaster that one or two smaller upside down loops so you know what it feels like.;
, Some people fear that they will get sick when they ride their first big roller coaster. Although this is much less common than people think, it’s a good idea not to eat or drink a large amount before getting on the roller coaster. Your stomach may already be in knots, and you can always have a celebratory ice cream after you finish the ride!It’s perfectly fine to eat a moderate amount before going on a roller coaster if you feel comfortable doing it. Not eating beforehand is a good way to soothe anxiety for those who are worried about getting sick on the ride.

, Many people who are afraid of roller coasters fear that they will get hurt during the ride or get dislodged and fall while on the roller coaster. Appease this fear by reading about or observing the safety features of the roller coaster that you want to try.All roller coasters have bars or even cages that come down and locks before the ride starts. These bars are made to keep you safe, and only unlock after the ride is over.
The bars usually go across your chest and also between your legs, so there is no way that you would be able to slip out of the roller coaster, even if it goes upside down.
The carts of roller coasters are connected to the rails, so it would be impossible for the cart to fall off. They also have an anti-roll back system that ensures that the carts keep moving forward as opposed to rolling backward., While you are standing in line, observe the roller coaster that you want to go on. Watch one complete cycle of the ride so that you know exactly when all the turns and loops are. Knowing exactly what you’re in for will make you feel more confident and less intimidated., While you are in line for the roller coaster, watch the people getting off the ride. They most likely will be excited and happy, talking about how fun the ride is. Seeing the reaction of people who have experienced the roller coaster should help you feel more certain that you’ll have a good time., Instead of worrying silently to yourself, talk with your friends as you are waiting in line. Chatting, laughing and staying positive will help to make you feel more brave and sure of yourself.

Remove excess water.,
Check for remaining water.,
Place the book in a sealed plastic bag.,
Place the book in the freezer.,
Check back in 1-2 weeks.",How to Repair a Wet Book2," If the book is entirely waterlogged, remove water by placing the book on its head atop an absorbent sheet of paper or a towel. Allow the water to drain and drip. Replace the absorbent fabric each time it becomes soaked through. If the book is only damp, you can shake it from side to side., If there is a lot of water remaining in the pages, it has not been drained properly. Place the book back on its head, and place absorbent paper inside both the front and back cover. This will help expedite the drying process and keep the spine intact.Avoid any absorbent paper (paper towel, newspaper, etc) with lettering or designs, as these may bleed onto the book.

, Place the damaged book into a plastic bag, and seal it. Do not perform a vacuum seal, however; you want some air to be able to reach the book’s pages, and some space to be between the texture of the bag and the book itself. A simple kitchen storage bag will work., Place the book on its spine in the freezer. If possible, keep food separate from the books, and give them their own shelf to facilitate air flow., This process takes quite some time before it works, so give your book 1-2 weeks, depending upon the length of the book. A longer book will require more time, while a shorter book may only need 4-5 days. If the book is still wavy and waterlogged, give it another couple of days before you remove it.

Done properly, this method will prevent tearing and bleeding ink.

Remove excess water from the book.,
Open the book covers to a 90-degree angle.,
Place the book near a fan.,
Place a heavy item on the closed book to compress wrinkled pages.",How to Repair a Wet Book3," This method is most effective for books with only partially damp pages. Completely waterlogged pages will not fan out properly. Remove excess water via shaking or blotting., Place the book on its head, opening the covers to a 90-degree angle, and allowing the pages to fan out. Try to fan the pages out as thoroughly as possible, as this will provide the best airflow possible.Although you want the pages to be spread apart, avoid prying still-wet pages; pulling wet pages apart could result in tearing or transferring ink.

, Place the book underneath a ceiling fan, or in front of a table fan, and turn the fan on a medium setting. A low setting will not provide enough airflow, while a high setting might cause your pages to fold and wrinkle. If your fan does not have a medium setting, use the lowest setting, instead., Using a paperweight, large rock, or even a large book, compress the dried pages in the closed book, leaving them for 24-48 hours. This will help smooth any remaining wrinkles in the pages.Make sure your book’s binding is aligned properly before placing a heavy object on top of it. If the binding or covers are off-center, you may do permanent damage to the binding.
Fan-drying may not prevent wrinkling, but a heavy object on top of the cover will minimize wrinkles and expanded pages.

Drain all remaining water from the book.,
Place your book on its head, keeping an absorbent cloth underneath the pages.,
Place hair dryer 6-8 inches away from the book.,
Pass over a few pages at a time.",How to Repair a Wet Book4," Drying with a hair dryer is another method better suited to damp books, though it can also be used on waterlogged items. Before drying with a blow dryer, however, all excess water must be removed. Leaving water behind could damage the book’s binding and cause mold or discoloration., This will give your book a great place to rest as you pass the dryer over the pages. Hold the book in place by placing your hand along its spine., Just as you would with your hair, hold the hair dryer 6-8 inches away from the book to avoid heat damage. Using either the cool or hot setting, move the air stream over each of the pages until they no longer feel wet, or are only slightly damp to the touch.Using a high heat setting could quickly damage the pages and run the risk of burning them. As you pass the dryer over the pages, touch them to make sure they are not growing hot. If the pages do become hot to the touch, move on to a new section and return after they have cooled.

, Going over a few pages at a time, start at the page’s binding, and move in a downward motion to the edge of the page. Go over a few pages at a time, moving on to a new section once those pages have dried.Do not dry the pages from the side, as you will likely miss some spots, and may encourage the paper to become brittle or wavy.
Drying your book quickly may cause wrinkling and page expansion. It is the fastest method, but may also do the most damage.

Use an x-acto knife with a fresh blade to remove excess glue, ripped pages, or threads that are sticking out from the text block., Measure the covers and spine you just removed, or measure the text block itself. If you choose to do the latter, add an additional 3/8 inch to the height.

, Use the measurements you've just taken to cut out three pieces of bristol board. You should have two cover pieces and the spine.

, Select a piece of sturdy cotton or linen fabric to act as the book cloth. Place the three pieces of the bristol board onto the cloth, with 3/8 of an inch in between each cover and the spine. Measure a 1 inch margin around the entire cover, and cut out the fabric into this large rectangular shape.

, Add a thick layer of book binding glue to the backside of your board cutouts, and place them in the same location as they were when you measured the fabric. Cut the corners of the fabric off at a 45 degree angle, and fold all the edges of the fabric over onto the inside of the covers. Add more binding glue to the inside, and use a bone folder to stick the fabric in place.

, A new cover needs end pages to glue the cover to the book. Use heavy stock paper for the end pages. Use a needle to weave the thread between the new end pages and the old sections of the book.

, Add a solid layer of glue to the inside of the front cover, and place the text block on the back cover. Fold over the end page in the front, and use a bone folder to smooth it out and securely glue it to the front cover. Repeat the same process with the back cover.

, Place the book in a book press overnight to dry. Place a piece of waxed paper in between the end pages and the text block to prevent pages from sticking."

Sit next to a friend.,
Sit in the middle of the train.,
Hold on to the restraints.,
Take a few deep breaths before the ride starts.,
Keep your eyes open.,
Scream to release tension.",How to Be Brave on Your First Big Roller Coaster2," Don’t allow yourself to get separated from your friends while you are boarding the ride. If the person working at the ride tries to seat you separately, tell them that you prefer to sit with your friend. A familiar face by your side will give you the courage that you need., If you can, aim for a seat near the middle of the train. If you’re already scared, it’s best not to sit in the front row where the ride can seem the scariest. The middle is the best location for those who feel nervous because it offers the smoothest ride and places you in the midst of the other rows so that you feel more secure., After you have sat down on the ride and are harnessed into your seat, grab hold of the bars near your chest. Rattle them as hard as you can so that you can see that you’re firmly strapped in, and that even with all your weight pressed against them, the restraints will hold.Holding onto the bars during the ride also helps you to feel more grounded and secure.

, Breathe deeply to relax your body and your mind before the ride starts. When people are nervous, they often hold their breath or breathe shallowly, which only adds to a quickened heart rate and feelings of anxiety., Even though it may seem counterintuitive, it’s actually better to keep your eyes open rather than shutting them during a roller coaster ride. Closing your eyes will prevent you from seeing what is coming on the ride, and psychologically makes you feel like you have less control over what is happening.When you are able to see that you are going to go down a big drop or go upside down, your body instinctually braces itself. If you don’t do this, the ride feels much rockier and wilder.

, Screaming on a roller coaster keeps your blood flowing and helps you to release your tension and anxiety. A roller coaster is one of the only places where you can scream your head off without any judgment, so go for it!"
"
Think of all the things that used to scare you that you now love.,
Remember that roller coasters are safe.,
Remind yourself that people love roller coasters for a reason.,
Visualize yourself on the roller coaster.",How to Be Brave on Your First Big Roller Coaster3," Because fear stems from negative thoughts, try to think encouraging and positive thoughts before and during the roller coaster ride. Start by remembering all the things that you were afraid of doing the first time that you now love to do.


These could be things like flying, going go-carting or riding a bike for the first time.
Think back on how scared or nervous you were to do these things for the first time. This should help you put the roller coaster ride into perspective, and you will be able to see that riding big roller coasters may be something that you discover you love to do!

, If you are afraid of getting hurt while riding the roller coaster, take a step back and remember that the chances of getting hurt on a roller coaster are much less than that of driving in a car, something that you likely do every day.


Even though roller coasters seem more extreme, remember that they are designed very carefully and regulated closely to ensure the safety of their passengers.
The chances of getting fatally injured on a roller coaster are 1 in 1.5 billion, which is a minuscule chance that is exponentially smaller than getting hurt in a car accident., Roller coasters are designed to be fun. Even if the prospect of riding the roller coaster makes you nervous, remember that millions of people wouldn’t enjoy riding roller coasters if they weren’t enjoyable., Visualization is a powerful tool that can help you feel less nervous. Before you go on the ride, close your eyes and try to see yourself on the roller coaster smiling and having a good time.


As simple as it sounds, having this mental picture of yourself having a good time can help you ease your nerves and start thinking of the roller coaster as something you actually will enjoy!"

Try to use two hands while reading.,
Send rare and fragile books to a specialist in book conservation.,
Shelve books upright.,
Keep books out of direct sunlight and in a cool area.,
Keep your books clean.",How to Keep Books in Good Condition," Handling your books hygienically will help ensure minimal wear and tear, accidental spills, or permanent stains. Wash your hands before handling any book and avoid having any liquids or foods nearby during handling or reading to help keep your book in an ideal condition.Avoid using saliva to turn pages and instead use a sponge.#*Use cotton gloves if you are handling a rare, old, or fragile book.;
, Large bookmarks can stress both the binding or glue in the spine of the book as well as make impressions and indentations in the page. Remove bulky bookmarks to reduce the chance of pages being accidentally ripped, torn, or damaged while reading.Try using a piece of thread or silk ribbon as a bookmark to avoid any unwanted damage.
If you wish to keep the bookmark with the book, place the bookmark in an acid free envelope next to the book or inside an insert.Avoid folding, or “dog-earing,” the corners of pages as they can cause lasting damage., Both paperback and hardback books are either bound with an adhesive, stitching, or a combination of the two. The wider you open a book, the more stress you are putting the spine and binding under.


Use caution when opening new hardbacks as they often have stiff spine and are prone to cracking., Pages experience natural deterioration over time and can often become quite fragile or brittle. Use caution when turning pages in order to avoid unwanted tears, wrinkles, dimples, and rips to pages or fragile bindings., Using two hands while reading will ensure that the book's binding and pages are not being unnecessarily stressed. If holding a book with two hands is uncomfortable due to fragility, size, or weight, lay the book on a table or cradle it in your lap.Don’t bend paperback covers while reading. It can be difficult to get them to resume their original shape and it often causes spine damage.Invest in reading copies if you have a book you can’t put down and want to preserve.

, Whether you have a rare first edition or a paperback with sentimental value, sending a damaged book to a specialist is your best chance at repair.


Book conservationists can have many specializations, from historic preservation to binding and material repair. Consult national book conservation organizations, like the Regional Alliance for Preservation (RAP) or the American Institute for Conservation (AIC), to find out which local conservationists can provide you with a consultation., Avoid shelving books too tightly or leaning against one another as this can cause lasting warping, structural damage, and cracking. When shelving, place books of similar height and length next to one another to avoid stressing the spine.


Placing a book flat is an alternative to upright shelving. However, when shelving a book horizontally be sure to put as little weight on top of it as possible.Grab the middle of the spine when removing a book from a shelf to avoid damaging the head (top) and foot (bottom) of the spine., Place your books in a controlled climate to help prolong the book’s quality. Sunlight, heat, and humidity can all have negative effects to the book’s binding, structure, and page quality.


Humidity can cause mildew to grow on your books. If you live in a particularly humid environment, and mildew begins to grow, simply wipe the mildew with a very dry cloth and leave the book in sunlight for 30-45 minutes. Be careful not to leave it longer as sunlight can cause the cover to fade.If a rare or fragile book grows mildew bring it to a specialist in book conservation.

, Clean your books regularly in order to prevent natural wear and tear and increase the quality of their storage. Dusting your books will help reduce permanent page and cover aging.


Make sure to dust your books from the spine outward so dust does not settle behind the spine.Avoid storing books in plastic bags. Books need to breathe and plastic can cause molding or warping. Instead, try wrapping the book in acid-free cloth or purchases a book storage box.

Look at books on the internet, at the bookstore or at the library for some ideas on how to design a book cover.,
The simplest method is to align the title and the artwork to the left edge of the book.,
A common style of alignment is where the title and artwork is centered.,
For an interesting placement of the title, place it on the right side.,
Simplify the design from the examples and design a simple book cover.,
Use a round tip, black marker pen to draw.,
Try other ideas, if you do not want to letter the title or draw the picture:


Print the title and use a font such as Times New Roman.,
Finally, in the design process, take your time and enjoy the process.",How to Design a Simple Book Cover," Also look at magazines, pamphlets, the packaging of products from the supermarket etc.;
, With this method, even if the title and artwork were smaller, you would still align it to the left (the spine side).

, This style is harder to do and you will have to use a ruler and pencil. With the pencil, make the initial lettering of the title, and if you are satisfied, go over it with a round tip, black marker pen.

, To balance it, place the artwork to the left. The artwork can also be placed in the center.

, You will need an inspiration for your artwork, choose a picture to draw that relates to the title. Search the dictionary, the internet, the yellow pages etc for something to draw under the title.

, From the photo, the words ""cover design"" can be replaced with the author's name, the book publisher, the book edition, etc. This simple book cover design required, in materials, just a ruler and a marker pen.

, With the title printed on white paper, you will have a lot of contrast as a bonus.
Print the artwork from the internet, use a photo, or cut out artwork from the newspaper, magazine, yellow pages etc. Printing your artwork with black ink on white paper will also have great contrast.
Choose and print the artwork first, later adjust the size of the lettering of the title, so that it will be in harmony with the picture. Black is always a good choice for the color of the lettering.
Make a simpler artwork such as an anchor instead of the ship.
Technically make the lettering precise. Artistically, make your cover pleasing to look at.
Use a multi-colored scheme for the title.
Instead of artwork, use a photo or a picture from the internet, of the actual book cover. In this photo, the title was not cut perfectly and by framing it the uneven cutting would not be visible. Frame the title also with a marker pen and a straight edge.

, Protect your book cover by covering it with clear, mailing tape such as in the previous photo. The contents of your textbook are more important than the cover, study hard!

Wipe or fling excess water from the book.,
Lay down a few paper towel sheets.,
Stand the book upright.,
Place paper towel sheets inside the covers.,
Allow the book to sit.,
Replace paper towels as needed.",How to Dry a Wet Book1," When it comes to drying a wet book, the exact steps you take will differ based on how wet the book is. If your book is completely soaked — so wet that it drips — you'll first want to carefully remove as much excess water from the outside of the book as you can. Hold the book shut and shake it gently to remove any external liquid. Follow this by gently wiping the outside of the cover with a rag or paper towel.


Don't open the book yet. If it's dripping wet, its pages will likely be so delicate that they'll easily tear. At this point, just concentrate on removing moisture that's on the outside of the book.;
, Next lay down a few sheets of plain white (not dyed) absorbent paper towel in a clear, flat dry area. Pick a spot where the book is unlikely to be disturbed as it dries.


If you live in a dry climate, this spot can be outside. However, regardless of where you live, you won't want to leave your book out overnight, as dew that forms in the morning can easily undo any progress you've made.
If you don't have any plain white paper towels handy, dry rags can work well. Don't use dyed paper towels, as these can bleed color when wet.

, Take your wet book and place it on top of your paper towels so that it stands straight upright. For hardcover books, this should be easy. Simply open the covers slightly (without separating the pages) until your book can stand balanced without any assistance. For paperbacks, this can be trickier. You don't want your book to sag at all as it dries, so, if need be, use bookends or weights to keep your book standing straight upright.

, Next, take two paper towel sheets (or, if none are handy, thin, dry rags) and tuck one inside each cover. The towels should sit between each cover and the text block (the internal pages of the book.)


Don't disturb the pages when you do this. The text block should basically remain in one large ""mass"". Fanning the pages at this point can lead to crumpled or deformed pages when the book dries.

, When you've arranged all of your paper towels, simply allow the book to sit in its standing position. The absorbent material of the paper towels should quickly begin to pull moisture out of the book.


If you want to, you can put one or more dried sponges underneath the paper towels the book is resting on to aid in the absorption process.

, Check on your book's progress every hour or so. As the paper towels pull moisture out of the book, they'll eventually become saturated, unable to hold any more liquid. When you notice that any of your paper towels have become saturated, carefully remove them and replace them with fresh, dry towels. If you're using a sponge, ring it out and return it to its place under the paper towels.


Don't forget to keep an eye on your book. Mold can begin to grow on wet paper within 24 to 48 hours if the moisture is allowed to stagnate.Continue in this fashion until the book no longer drips or leaves puddles when you pick it up. Next, you'll want to proceed to ""Drying Somewhat Wet Books"" below.

"
"
Place paper towels every 20-30 pages.,
Let the book sit on its side.,
Replace paper towels as needed.,
Keep the book square as it dries.",How to Dry a Wet Book2," If your book isn't dripping wet (or was and has now dried partially), it should be safe to carefully and gently flip through the pages without ripping them. Open your book and carefully flip through the pages, placing absorbent paper towel sheets between the pages every 20-30 pages or so. In addition, place paper towel sheets inside each cover between the cover and the text block.


Be careful with the number of paper towels you place in the book this way — if you place too many, it's possible to cause the spine of the book to bend backwards, which can deform the book if allowed to dry like this. You may need to space your paper towels more widely if this becomes a problem.

, After you've finished laying paper towel sheets throughout the book, set the book down on its side to dry, rather than standing it upright. The absorbent paper towel sheets should begin to draw moisture away from the inside of the book. This process can take some time, so be patient.


To speed the process up, ensure that your book is in a location where dry air is able to circulate continuously. If you live in a humid climate, a dehumidifier can be a big help here. Otherwise, turning on a fan or opening a few windows will usually suffice.

, As above, you'll want to regularly check on your book as it dries. When you notice your paper towels becoming saturated with liquid, carefully remove them and insert new paper towels roughly every 20-30 pages or so. To ensure the book dries evenly, try not to lay down paper towels between the exact same pages each time.


Each time you replace the paper towels, flip the book over. This helps prevent the pages from deforming and ""ruffling up"" as they dry.

, As paper and cardboard dry, they stiffen and harden. This means that if your book is lying at a slanted angle as it dries, it can eventually become permanently deformed. To avoid this, keep the book perfectly ""square"" as it dries. If the book resists your efforts to straighten it out, use heavy bookends or weights to hold its edges in place.


Eventually, your book will dry to a point that your paper towels no longer become saturated — merely damp. At this point, you'll want to proceed to ""Drying Slightly Damp Books"" below.

"
"
Stand the book upright and open it.,
Fan the pages out.,
Circulate dry air in the room.,
When dry, place under weight to flatten.,
Hang small paperbacks over a fishing line.",How to Dry a Wet Book3," Begin to dry your damp book by standing it up vertically. As noted above, this is usually easy if your book is hardbound, but can be trickier if you have a paperback. If you need to, you can use heavy weights or bookends to keep the book upright. Open the book a moderate amount — no more than about 60o. Ensure the book is well-balanced and is unlikely to fall over before proceeding.

, Without opening the book's cover to more than about 60o, gently fan the book's pages out. Try to arrange the pages so that there is a tiny gap between most (if not all) of them. The pages should be able to stand roughly upright — none should hang at a diagonal angle or flop limply against neighboring pages.

, When your book's pages are evenly fanned out, allow it to begin drying in its upright position. To speed the drying process, ensure that relatively dry air is circulating freely through the room. Use a fan or create a draft by opening a few windows, or, if the ambient air is fairly humid, use a dehumidifier to make it drier.


If you use a fan or a natural breeze, look at the edges of the book's pages closely. The movement of the air shouldn't cause the pages to flutter or flap in the wind, as this can lead the pages to become ruffled and ""puffed up"" when they dry.
Be patient here. It can take days or even a week or more for the book to dry completely. Check on your book frequently to get a sense for how quickly you're making progress.

, Eventually, after you've allowed your book to dry patiently, no further moisture should remain in its pages. However, even if you've followed the instructions very carefully, it's likely that the book won't sit completely flat once it's dry. The paper used for most books' pages is somewhat fragile and can easily warp and deform as it dries, leaving the book with a ""crumpled"" or ""ruffled"" appearance when it's finally dry. Luckily, to a certain extent, this can be fixed. Lay your dry book flat and place a heavy weight on top of it (thick textbooks are great for this) and allow it to sit for several days to a week. This can substantially reduce the ""crumpled"" effect that drying can produce, though it may not fix it completely.


To avoid deforming your book, make sure that its edges are perfectly square as it lays under the weight. Don't let the weight sit on top of it in a way that bends the book or forces the edges of its pages to lay at a diagonal angle.

, While the methods above should work well for most books, small, thin paperbacks can be dried with a shortcut that requires a little less effort than the fanned pages method above. If your paperback is very wet, dry it as you normally would according to the methods above until it reaches a point where it's just damp — paper towels inserted into its pages should no longer become saturated with moisture. At this point, string a fishing line, a thin wire, or a piece of string between two vertical surfaces and hang the book over it so that it opens downward. If you're indoors, circulate the air with a fan or use a dehumidifier. Within a few days, the book should be dry.


As noted above, if you're hanging your paperback outside (for instance, if you're using an existing clothing line), don't let it stay out overnight. Dew that forms in the morning can dampen the book.
Don't hang paperbacks that are very wet. Since moisture makes paper more fragile, the fishing line or wire can tear the book under its own weight if it's too wet.

"
Place separation sheets between every wet page.,
When damp, remove sheets and fan out to dry.,
Monitor frequently to prevent sticking.,
If short on time, freeze the book.,
Allow frozen books to thaw gradually.",How to Dry a Wet Book4," When books with shiny, glossy pages (like many magazines and art books) become wet, the situation is somewhat more urgent than with ordinary books. Moisture can dissolve the pages' glossy coating, turning it into an adhesive substance that can make the pages stick together permanently if allowed to dry. To prevent this, immediately separate the wet pages from each other by placing sheets of waxed paper in between every single pair of wet pages. Remove and replace the sheets as they become wet.


It's important to put a separating sheet between every wet page. If two wet pages are allowed to touch as they dry, they can become stuck together in such away that even professionals can't repair.
If you don't have waxed paper handy, plain white paper towels will work so long as they are replaced frequently.

, When the pages of the book dry to a point that they're simply damp and the separating sheets are no longer becoming wet, remove the separating sheets and stand the book upright. If it can't support its own weight, use two bookends or heavy objects to support it. Fan the pages out to a width of no more than 60o. Allow the book to dry in this position.


As above, you'll want to ensure that the air around the book is circulating if you can by using a fan or opening a window to create a draft. As also noted above, dehumidifiers can be helpful, especially if the air is humid.

, Though the pages are now damp, rather than wet, there is still a risk that they may stick together. To avoid this, check on the book frequently as it dries — if you can, once every half hour or so. Thumb through the book's pages carefully. If you notice any beginning to stick together, separate them and allow the book to continue to dry. Eventually, the book should dry out completely. Some minor instances of pages sticking together (especially in the corners) may be unavoidable.


As above, if you're using a fan, you won't want the book's pages to flutter in the moving air, as this can lead to a crumpled or ruffled appearance once the book dries.

, If you have a wet book with glossy pages on your hands and you don't have the time or materials to separate the pages at your disposal, don't let the book sit. Instead, place it in a freezer-safe plastic bag, seal the bag, and place it in a freezer (the colder the better). Freezing your book won't do much to dry it, but it will prevent damage, giving you time to get everything you need to be able to dry the book properly.


Don't forget to put the book in a freezer bag before putting it in the freezer. Doing this prevents the book from sticking to inside of the freezer or other objects.

, If you're ready to attempt to dry your frozen book, remove it from the freezer but keep it in its bag and set it in a room-temperature location. Allow the book to thaw gradually within its bag — this can take from a few hours up to several days, depending on how large and wet the book is. When the ice is completely melted, remove the book from the bag and dry it as described above.


Don't let a thawing book sit in its bag past the point that it thaws. Leaving your book in a damp, confined space encourages mold growth.

Determine how famous the book is.,
Determine if the work is a first edition.,
Consider the book's subject matter.,
Look at how rare the book is.,
Look at the book's condition.,
Look at the history of ownership.",How to Find the Value of Old Books1," A book can be famous for several reasons. Among them are the following:


Historical and social significance of the book. Darwin's ""On the Origin of Species"" is famous for delivering his theory of natural selection, which became the prevailing theory of evolution.
How famous the author is. Part of an author's fame can be determined by how much his words have carried outside his own writing. William Shakespeare wrote nearly 40 plays, text from which has been quoted in other literary works, in broadcast media, and in conversation.
First appearance of a famous character. Arthur Conan Doyle's 1887 ""A Study in Scarlet"" was the first appearance of Sherlock Holmes, arguably the most famous fictional detective, while Edgar Rice Burroughs' 1914 ""Tarzan of the Apes"" marked the first appearance of the famous feral man in book form.;
, A number of book collectors prize first editions of books in areas that interest them, and sometimes outside of them. Determining if a book is a first edition, though, is often as much about determining the book is not a first edition as determining that it is.


Some first editions display the words ""First Edition"" on the title page, but many don't.
A first edition book will have only a single publication date, while a reprint will have multiple publication dates, include the word ""Printing"" (as in ""Second Printing"") or ""Edition"" (with an ordinal number other than ""First""), or display a series of numbers, with the lowest indicating which printing it is.
In some cases, a book may be reprinted by a publisher other than the publisher who originally published it. It may be described as ""First (publisher name) Edition"" to indicate that the press is not the original publisher of the work.

, Some book collectors specialize in collecting old books on a specific subject, such as science or medicine, or books that were part of an exhibition such as 1963's ""Printing and the Mind of Man.""

, As with most collectible items, the fewer copies of an old book that exist, the more valuable each individual remaining copy is. While determining the number of private owners is difficult at best, you can look up how many copies are held in public, corporate, and collegiate libraries by consulting a reference such as the National Union Catalog, a printed reference, or WorldCat, an online database.

, A book's condition has an impact on how valuable it is, although this may be offset somewhat by its age. Factors in evaluating a book's condition include the following:


If the book has all its pages and plates
If the book has its original binding
If the binding is secure (front and back boards of the cover are firmly attached)
If the pages are stained or discolored

, The history of who owned the book, or its provenance, can have an impact on its value, particularly if the owner was famous. A bookplate with the owner's name, a handwritten signature, or an author's autograph mentioning the owner's name can help to establish provenance.

Remove the book from its damp environment.,
Place your books in a sealed container with baking soda.,
Allow the soda to sit for a few days.,
Remove the baking soda and books from the container.,
Store in an a dry area.",How to Deodorize a Musty Book1," Many books grow moldy or musty due to living in a damp environment, such as a kitchen or bathroom. To combat your book’s smell, you must first remove it from the problematic environment.If your book is wet, be sure to dry it before using any of the deodorizing methods.;
, Set your books inside of a sealed container, such as a piece of large tupperware, alongside an open cannister of baking soda. The sealed environment will provide a way for the baking soda to absorb both moisture and odors from your book.Clay cat litter and cornstarch can also be used to absorb odor.

, Set your books aside in an area they will not be disturbed for 3-7 days. This will give the baking soda plenty of time to absorb both the moisture in the books, and the offending odor.Hardcover books may need to sit closer to seven days, as the cover can hold in more moisture.

, Check for any remaining smells or damp pages. If your book is still damp or still contains unpleasant smells, place your materials back into your sealed container for 2-4 more days., To prevent further molding or mildewing, opt out of storing your books in more humid areas. Cookbooks, for instance, can be stored in a dining room instead of a kitchen, and bathroom interest books can be set on a shelf just outside of the bathroom.

Avoid storing books in areas such as the basement and attic, as most basements and attics are prone to encouraging mold growth and developing excessive moisture contents.

Repurpose your bookshelves.",How to Arrange Bookshelves," If you intend to primarily use your bookshelves to contain books (how novel!), then it is best to assess your inventory before you begin. Remove all your books from your shelves, dust them off and clean and polish your empty bookshelves before you refill them.Go through your books and decide which ones you want to keep and which ones you want to give away. You can donate books to friends, your local library or a literacy council.
You will probably want to keep books that have strong sentimental value, such as favorite books from childhood or your studies, beloved novels or comic books.
If you have newer books that you have received within the past year but haven't read, then give them away. It is unlikely you will read them and they take up valuable space on your shelves.;
, One of the most logical methods for organizing your books is by author. You can take your books and arrange them alphabetically by the author's last name.This will make for a convenient system for finding books. Make sure that you always put your books back in correct order.
If you have multiple books by the same author, you can then arrange that author's books by their titles alphabetically or you can arrange them chronologically in the order that they were published., You might find a better way to arrange your books is by similar types. If you are a big fan of mysteries, consider dedicating a couple shelves to your favorite thrillers.


You can consider other genres and time periods such as science fiction, fantasy, horror, or gothic novels. You can also arrange by different types of writing, such as short stories, plays, poetry, and novels.You could also arrange your books alphabetically by author within each genre's category.

, For the true bibliophile, this might seem like a strange idea, but if you have an eye for design, arranging books by color can add an appealing sense of balance to a room.If you don't want to group exact colors together, you can generally divide books by light and dark colors.You can also arrange your books by exact colors so they form a rainbow of colors in your room. Start with bold, bright colors like reds and oranges and then move to cooler, deeper colors like greens and blues.Arranging books by color can give a sense of visual order to a random collection of books.

, It can be hard to remember which books you have simply just by looking at your shelves. If you want to keep a list of your inventory of books, try popular web sites such as Library Thing and Delicious Library 2.Library Thing in particular has a social media component where you can receive feedback from other users. You can look to them for feedback on arranging your library.

, Books can take up a lot of visual space in the bookshelves. If you stagger other decorative pieces into your bookshelves, this can help break up the space from the monotonous look of the books. If you have collections with items like bowls, pictures, vases, statues, paintings, or clocks, these can be great things to display on your bookshelves.
Arrange some of your books in stacks. Most of us put books into shelves vertically with the spines facing outward. Consider arranging a few books on a shelf in a stack in which the lay horizontally. Put the largest book on the bottom of the stack and then move upward with smaller books.Turn the spines outward so you can see the title., When you make room for other items in your bookshelves, you can see the background of the shelves more clearly. Consider painting your shelves a bright color to add a bright spot to your room.If you are renting an apartment and are not allowed to paint your walls (or don't want to take the time to do this), then painting your bookcase is a good way to add your distinctive style to your space.

, If you prize a uniform look on your bookshelves, then consider wrapping your books in a white paper. You can also achieve a uniform look by using decorative pieces all in the same shade of color (or a neutral color like white or black).


You can also place storage bins or boxes in a common texture and color -- like wicker or fabric -- on a bookshelf. This will give a very organized, uniform look to your shelves.

, Bookshelves can take up a large amount of space and set the mood for an entire room. Because they are quite expensive, you have perhaps bought the most affordable option you can find or have inherited them from friends and family.


Think about ways you can personalize your bookshelves if you cannot afford to buy your ideal ones. If they are wooden, consider re-staining them in a different color or repainting them so they fit the aesthetic of the larger room.You can also use a brightly colored wall paper pattern and apply it to the inside walls of the bookshelf or even the outer sides of the shelves., Bookshelves are commonly used to balance a room and often placed on either side of a table or sofa. Consider other corners or rooms you might not usually place them in (like a bedroom or breakfast nook).


You can also consider building in shelves to different rooms if you do not have room for a stand-alone bookshelf. This can save lots of precious space if you are in a small space., If you no longer have the need for extra bookshelves, consider reworking them for other purposes before donating them or throwing them away.For example, if you have a 5-shelf bookshelf, consider removing the top three shelves and moving the unit to your front entrance or foyer. You can add hooks to the back of the shelf and then use it to hang coats and hats. Add storage bins for shoes and umbrellas in the lower two remaining shelves.You can also use bookshelves or built-in shelves to hold things like china and kitchen appliances if you do not have enough cabinet space in your kitchen.

Pull books forward.",How to Declutter a Bookshelf," Decluttering is a process best done in small chunks. Go through your books shelf by shelf. This can make the task seem manageable and may also help you decide which books to keep, give away, or toss., Each of your books will have a different type of value you attach to it. Knowing this value can help you separate books into piles for reorganization. Ask yourself the following questions to determine the value your books:Does the book serve a purpose?
Does it have sentimental value?
Does it have monetary value?
Will I reread or reuse it?
Have I read it? Will I ever read it?

, Have boxes labeled for “keep,” “donate,” “sell/trade,” “store,” and “trash.” As you determine your books’ individual values, place them in these different piles. You can reevaluate each pile before you begin placing the books back in the bookshelves or giving them away.Consider having an undecided box for those you’re wavering on. Recognize, however, that this can create the temptation to put nearly everything in this pile.

, Sort out duplicates and give them to friends or a charitable organization. This is one of the easiest things you can do to cut down on the clutter in your bookshelves.Consider keeping duplicate if you have multiple volumes and use the newer and older versions.

, Large numbers of trade fiction paperbacks and magazines can quickly clutter up the most organized bookshelf. Weigh the value of paperbacks and magazines to yourself and then determine if they are better given away.Place magazines and paperbacks you want to keep in decorative bins, files, or containers. This can keep bookshelves organized while giving them a pop of color and texture.

, Go through each pile of books methodically. Ask yourself about each book’s value to you and whether you should keep it. This can help you further cull your collection and keep it decluttered on the shelves.


Ask family members for their opinions on your decisions. This can minimize the risk of giving away something another person holds dear., Throw away any books and/or magazines that are ripped, torn, molded, or otherwise unusable. Not only does this keep your bookshelves decluttered, but also minimizes the risk of them cluttering another person’s collection. Consider taking them to a recycling facility to help protect the environment., Place any books you still want but don’t want to display in a small closet or other storage space. This can keep them from cluttering your bookshelves without having to get rid of the books. Make sure to close and label any boxes of books you choose to store., Give out your books that you don’t want to keep. Friends, colleagues and loved ones may be happy to have a copy of the book.You can also donate your books to a local library or charitable organization, which may distribute them to the less fortunate or sell them for a small sum to help others., Consider how you want your bookshelves to look before repopulating them. Maybe you want them to include decorative touches, or alphabetized or color-coded books. A good rule of thumb is one-third each books, accessories, and empty space.Developing an organization scheme for your books can help you quickly and effectively reshelve your collection without cluttering it again.Consider some of the following organizational schemes:


Alphabetically
By genre
By color
By subject

, Adding design elements can also help organize your bookshelves and keep them clutter-free. Painting or wallpapering individual shelves or the walls behind them not only frames your books, but can be a nice reminder to avoid filling them with too many books or other sundry items. Mix your books with picture frames, bookends, and collectibles to keep the space visually interesting.Consider items with rounded edges, which make a nice contrast with the books., Put your larger books on the far right end of the shelf. For matching shelves on the left side, place the larger items on the far left. This scheme ensures you can more easily fill in the shelves without overstuffing them. It also creates a visually interesting space that you can easily keep decluttered over time.Put larger non-book items in the far corners of shelves as well.

, Begin putting your smaller books and items onto the shelves according to your organization plan. Place larger items toward the bottom and smaller ones towards the top. Alternate stacks of horizontal and vertical books. This can maximize space, keep your books organized, and add visual interest., If you’re organizing by genre or subject, you may need more space to accommodate the books than a vertical arrangement allows. Having a few books vertically organized and other horizontally stacked can open up even more space in your bookshelves. It also allows you to use the stacked books as bookends for the vertically-arranged volumes and vice versa.A good ratio to organize your books is 60% vertical to 40% horizontal.

, Line up each book with the end of the shelf floor. This keeps the space uniform. It can also prevent you from stuffing additional books on to the shelves."

Consult a printed reference guide.,
Consult an online reference.,
Have the book appraised.",How to Find the Value of Old Books2," A number of printed references to collectible books exist, many of them specialized by the type of book. Among them are these:


Allen and Patricia Ahern's ""Collected Books: The Guide to Values"" covers first editions.
Tom Broadfoot's ""Civil War Books: A Priced Checklist"" and E. Lee Baumgarten's ""Price Guide for Children's and Illustrated Books for the Years 1880-1945"" are among the many references to books of a specialized type or subject.
American Book Prices Current"" and ""Book Auction Records"" are two of the reference guides for prices old books fetched at auction, while the semiannual ""Bookman's Price Index"" summarizes the information from book dealers' catalogs to produce its list of prices.

, Several online references exist to help you research the value of an old book; among them are Abebooks, Addall, Bookfinder, and the Advanced Book Exchange. Some of these sites require you to pay a fee, while others are free. Either pay or free sites may require you to register before you can search their databases.

, Appraisals can be done by a certified book appraiser or informally by a dealer in second-hand or rare books. Depending on the depth of the appraisal, you may have to pay a fee for the service.


You can find a second-hand or rare book dealer in your community by consulting your local telephone directory. To find a dealer nationally or internationally, consult an organization such as the Antiquarian Booksellers Association of America, the International League of Antiquarian Booksellers. You can also consult the Sheppard's series of reference directories to find an antiquarian bookseller in North America or Europe.
To be referred to a certified appraiser in the United States, contact the American Society of Appraisers or the Appraisers Association of America.
When having a book appraised, let the appraiser see the book itself if at all possible. If this isn't possible, photograph the front and back of the title page, the first and last text pages, the outer covers, and the spine.

Use protective breathing tools.,
Wipe away any visible mold growth.,
Dry your books immediately.,
Store in a dry area.",How to Deodorize a Musty Book2," Any time you work with mold or mildew, you want to make sure you are not breathing in any spores. Before you begin, place a mask over your nose and mouth. If you are prone to watery eyes, you may also want to wear a pair of protective glasses.If you have asthma or any type of respiratory issues, do not attempt mold clean-up yourself. Mold can aggravate breathing conditions quickly, and could even prove fatal.

, Locate any visible sources of mold in your book and gently wipe them away using cloth dampened with alcohol or peroxide. Although alcohol may not remove all of the staining caused by mold or mildew, it will kill the spores and should eliminate the bulk of the smell.If your books contain a lot of mold or mildew, you may need to take them to a professional for cleaning.

, Make sure you dry your books after you have finished cleaning them. You can use an air dry method, or you can dry them with a hair dryer. The method you choose will depend on the speed you require and the age of the books.Newer books will not be drastically degraded by being dried with a hair dryer, while old pages may be damaged by high heat.

, To prevent additional mold growth, make sure you store your books in a dry area. If your books are old or particularly prone to damage, you may want to store them permanently in airtight containers, such as large tupperware bins."
"
Choose a sunny, open area.,
Place the book open and upright.,
Dry for 2-3 days.",How to Deodorize a Musty Book3," The sun can work wonders in speeding up drying time while offering an antimicrobial effect for your books. Find a spot outdoors safe from animals and bugs, and place your books in the sun.This method is best for newer books, as old books can actually be damaged by exposure to sunlight.
If you do not have an open area with access to sunlight, find a large, sunny window.

, With the pages facing the sun, place your book upright, fanning the pages out as much as you can. This will allow the maximum amount of sunlight and warmth to reach your book. The more warmth and sunlight your book receives, the faster it will dry.Make sure the pages do not clump or stick together, as sunlight could encourage already-tacky pages to stick together.

, Dry your book in this fashion for 2-3 days to eliminate any lingering odors or moisture. The sun will both dry and deodorize your book, while drying the pages will prevent the growth of mold.

To prevent dampness from recurring during the drying period, bring books inside during the night and place them back outside once the sun is shining.
If you cannot keep your books safely outside for this period, you can also use a large indoor space with access to a window.

Eliminate fire and smoke hazards.,
Avoid extreme temperatures and conditions.,
Select a wooden or metal bookcase.,
Dim harsh lighting.,
Clean your storage space thoroughly.,
Vacuum pages and binding with a handheld vacuum.,
Wipe pages with microfiber cloths.,
Brush with a natural-fiber brush.,
Eradicate and prevent insect activity.,
Search for staining, mold, and mildew.,
Place books upright.,
Group according to size.,
Space books carefully.,
Clean your books and storage regularly.,
Adjust conditions as seasons change.,
Handle your books carefully.",How to Care for Rare Books," Although fire and smoke are typically accidental occurrences, avoid placing books in a room or corner susceptible to smoke or fire exposure. Books should not be placed in a room adjacent to a fireplace or wood-burning stove, nor should they be in an area prone to steam, such as a kitchen, laundry room, or bathroom. , Refrain from storing books in a room prone to extreme temperatures. Hot rooms might include laundry rooms, kitchens, and sunrooms, while cold rooms might include a garage, pantry, laundry room, or similarly poorly-insulated area. The ideal temperature for books is between 65 and 72 degrees F (or 18-22 degrees C). Keep this in mind when choosing a designated storage area for your collection. , Rough shelving such as particle board can damage the binding of books, while chemically-treated or painted shelves can leach into books, causing staining, disintegration, or weakening of the binding’s fibers. When choosing a case or shelf, look for smooth, sealed wood intended for indoor use, or smooth, enameled metal. , Harsh, intense light, whether from the sun or from a bulb, can cause fading and damage to rare and old books. Choose a space not regularly touched by the sun, and avoid placing heavy overhead lighting beside your books. They will thrive best in a darker environment, such as a corner or interior room. , Whether you plan to place your books in an open bookshelf, or a closed case, make sure the area has been cleaned before placing your books into it. Remove any dust from shelves, and wipe down all surfaces. Cleaning the top of your bookshelf has the potential to rain dust upon your tomes, so make sure every possible surface of your shelf or case has been thoroughly scrubbed.

, Use a small, handheld vacuum to gently lift dirt and debris from the pages and binding. For very old, delicate books, avoid pressing the vacuum directly to the book’s surface; instead, allow it to hover just above the surface, moving slowly and gently from side to side. , Microfiber cloths are both gentle and excellent for picking up dust. Using a clean microfiber cloth, gently wipe down each of the book’s pages. This cleaning method should be conducted using gloves, as the oils present in skin can smudge or otherwise damage old pages.

, Your brush can be a specialty brush, specifically for books, or even an unused bottle brush--more important than its intended purpose is the brush’s material. Horsehair, coconut bristles, and other natural fibers will be gentler on the spine and pages than plastic or acrylic. , Insects are often attracted to books, and can be found nesting or snacking on the pages, glue, binding, or cover. Search for any small holes in the pages, small bodies, or egg sacs.


If you find insect activity of any kind, place your book in a sealed plastic bag, and store it in the freezer for 2-3 days. Upon removal, wipe or vacuum away any remaining insects, larvae, or egg sacs.
Place camphor-soaked linen on your shelves or sprinkle diatomaceous earth around the bookcase in question. This acts as powerful deterrents for insects, and mice, and both are safe to keep near old, valuable books., While staining cannot be reversed in most cases, it can provide insight into the conditions the book requires. Water staining, for instance, will tell you the book may be particularly sensitive to moisture, while yellowing of the pages suggests a sensitivity to heat.


Mold and mildew are both brought on by warm, moist conditions, and may be reversed with cool, dry air. As with insect activity, place the book in the freezer for 3-4 days, before gently scraping away any remaining mold or mildew, or using a vacuum with a HEPA filter. , Books should be lined up vertically on a shelf, rather than stacked or set horizontally. Improper storage such as stacking can cause the binding to break down, resulting in the dissolution of the book’s structure. , Books should be placed alongside similarly-sized books to prevent bowing. Placing large books alongside smaller books could, over time, encourage the top of the cover to sag outward, resulting in a curved, irregular appearance. If you have a wide array of sizes and shapes, group them according to size as much as possible, using thin metal bookends to corral each size. , Spacing books loosely will allow them to lean, resulting in weak binding and warped covers. Books should fit snugly against each other, but should not be packed in tightly, as this, too, could damage the binding. Ideally, books should be spaced in such a way that they all stand upright, with enough wiggle room to allow a small finger to wedge between them. , At least once per month, go over your books and shelves with a light dusting, using a dry microfiber cloth. Once every 3-6 months, repeat the cleaning instructions identified above, once again checking for insect or mold activity. , Evaluate the storage space you have chosen during each new season to make sure peak conditions are kept. In summer, make sure the room is suitably cool, and in winter, make sure the room is heated properly. If humidity is a problem in some seasons, consider placing a dehumidifier near your bookcase. , Although you may collect your books purely for show, many collectors revel in touching, smelling, and sharing their books. When you handle your books, do so with care: use gloves, and avoid pulling on the book’s spine or pages. Instead, insert your fingers on either side of the book in question, and gently remove it from its place by exerting pressure on the front and back cover. Turn pages slowly and carefully.

Fan out the pages of your book.,
Use a hairdryer to dry pages.,
Let books stand to dry in a spot free of moisture.,
Use silica packets to remove moisture.,
Try kitty litter.,
Try baking soda.,
Place newspaper between the pages.,
Use fabric softener sheets.,
Cut a small square of fresh, fragrant drawer liner.,
Use strong essential oils.,
Check storage areas beforehand.,
Use appropriate storage containers.,
Plan your shelving carefully.,
Add dust jackets to books.",How to Remove the Mildew Smell from Books," Stand the book upright on a table. Fan out the pages gently. If your fingers can't disentangle pages without ripping them, use a letter opener and tweezers to separate pages. Alternatively, blow toward the top of your book to fan the pages out.;
, If you would like to speed up the process, you can aim a hairdryer at the pages of your book. Keep it on a warm setting to avoid books becoming affected by heat damage. Continue aiming the hairdryer at your upright book until the pages are dry.

, Either choose a warm spot inside your home or place the book in the sun. Only place the book in direct sunlight if your book isn't valuable. Direct sunlight may fade the book and, especially for older books, this could lead to permanent disintegration, discoloration, and the curling up of the pages. Ensure that every page is dry before returning the book to its shelf.

, You can purchase silica gel packets from an arts and crafts store; these keep things dry by attracting any moisture.Place these within the pages of your book and leave them for about three days. If you are worried about creating indents in the pages, only leave them in the book for one day., You will need a large container, such as a Rubbermaid tub, and a smaller container. Fill the larger container halfway with kitty litter, which will act as an absorbent. Place your book at the bottom of the smaller container. Place it inside the larger container that is filled with cat litter.Leave the book to sit in the absorbent for a few days. Check every few days. If the odor has gone, remove the book or books and dust off (a new paint brush is ideal for dusting). If not, repeat until the book smells better.
Store in a clean, dry place to avoid reintroducing mildew.

, Place a cup of baking soda into a plastic box or bin. Place the book or books (this method is good for more than one book) inside and seal the lid well. Let it sit for 48-72 hours, and then check. Repeat this process until the odor is gone.


Another approach if you live where it's dry and sunny: Sprinkle baking soda between every 10 pages or so. Leave the book open outside during the daytime for a few days in a row, turning pages often. Continue until it smells better. This won't work for all mildew or musty odors, but it can be helpful for some. This is not advised for valuable or antique books.

, Place a sheet of newspaper between every few pages of the book. Leave the newspaper in the book for three to five days. Do not use this method on valuable or old books, since newspaper is acidic and may transfer ink to the book.

, These sheets absorb odors from fabric and they can do so for books, too. Again, the oils in dryer sheets can damage books, so be mindful when using this method. Cut a bunch of sheets into thirds, and put one between every 20 pages or so in the smelly book. Keep the book in a zipper bag a few days, then the musty smell should be gone.Try the following:


This method is good for preventing the musty smell of books as well––just put a piece of a fabric softener sheet in every fifth book, or so, on your bookshelf.

, Place it inside a book. Use 2-3 pieces, depending on the size of the book. Then, place the book inside a resealable plastic bag. Let it sit in a dry spot for a week or two.


Check to see if the fresh odor has been transferred to the book. Continue until the book smells better.

, Add drops of an essential oil like lavender, eucalyptus, or tea-tree oil to cotton balls to a sealable plastic bag. Add the book to the plastic bag and seal. Remove your book after a few days. Due to the risk of oil spots, only do this with less valuable books that you want to read, such as textbooks.

, The storage area should be dry and temperate, as cold can encourage dampness and heat can dry out paper, causing it to crumble. Excessive humidity is bad for books, so either find storage with low humidity or reduce the humidity.Check the attic or basement for leaks, mildew and dampness.
Check your storage facility for bad odors or signs of mildew before storing your book there.

, Choose plastic boxes if the storage area is prone to leaks or dampness. Also, add silica gel sachets in case of condensation.

, Don't overfill your bookshelves. Ensure that there is adequate air circulation between books. Check to make sure that bookcases are not standing against cold, moldy, or damp walls.

, These clear jackets will keep moisture away from your beloved book. It's easier and cheaper to replace dust jackets than to replace the book cover or its binding, so dust jackets offer an affordable solution.

Put the book in the bag, fold over the top of the bag, and seal it with packing tape. Otherwise, wrap the book in a grocery store produce bag or other plastic bag and tape the edges closed.;
, Cut two pieces of plain cardboard that are slightly larger than the book. Sandwich the book between them to protect the cover.Use plain cardboard rectangles, as cardboard with print or stickers may stick to the book or transfer print onto the cover.

, Wrap brown paper, newspaper, or wrapping paper around the plastic and cardboard protectors, then tape it in place. This secures the cardboard in place and helps keep the book clean., Pick a sturdy box or container with some extra room for packing material around the edges. You’ll want to make sure your books can lay flat and that the edges won’t get squished or bent., Line the bottom of the box with padding. Then, carefully add the books to the container. Add extra padding on top and around the books to keep them safe; bubble wrap, packing peanuts, and crumpled plastic bags are lightweight options. Crumpled newspaper works too, but the weight may add a bit more to shipping costs.Damage usually happens to the corners of hardcover books, which can get bent (or ""bumped"" as they say in the book trade). Pay special attention to padding the corners.
If you have the space, separate all books with their own layer of padding. One way to do this is to sort the books by size, in stacks, and wrap each stack in bubble wrap.

, Close the box lid by laying the flaps flush, rather than weaving them together. Place packing tape halfway up one side, across the lid, and down the other side. Repeat with a second piece of tape in a cross shape. Cover any flap or opening with packing tape to prevent something from catching on it and ripping it apart.For extra protection, tape along each edge seam of the box as well, but don't use tape more than necessary. It's a nuisance if the recipient has to cut off yards of tape to get to the book.

, Print a label or write the address and return information clearly. If your address label was printed on plain paper, it may tear in transit. Tape down the entire label with clear packing tape. Leave barcodes bare, since tape can make them more difficult to scan., While this doesn’t guarantee that your books will arrive at their destination safely, it does let postal workers know to be cautious with your package. Use a red marker or ask a postal worker to provide a stamp or sticker for you., If you are sending a large quantity of books or books that are rare or valuable, you may want to purchase insurance. The insurance will provide you with money back in case your package gets lost or stolen., In many cases, tracking numbers are now provided for free, but if they are not, add tracking to your package. This way you will know where your package is and when it gets delivered., The U.S. Postal Service allows you to send books, DVDs, CDs, printed music, and sound recordings through media mail at a discounted rate. The shipping container must weigh less than 70 lbs (32 kg) to qualify for media mail.Many other postal services also offer a discounted price for shipping books. Be sure to ask a postal worker about this option, as it can save you as much as 50% on shipping costs."

Give away unwanted books.,
Check for size restrictions.,
Divide into fiction and nonfiction.,
Sort fiction by genre or author.,
Sort nonfiction by topic.",How to Organize a Bookshelf1," It's easiest to part with books before you organize the whole collection. Box away books you'll never read again, or that you'll never get around to. You can sell these or give them away at used bookstores, charity stores, libraries, or websites such as Book Mooch or Book Scouter.;
, Before you construct a master plan, make sure you know the limitations. Some bookcases have shelves of different spacing, which may require keeping paperbacks on one shelf and hardbacks on another. Textbooks or coffee table art books may need to be stacked flat in order to fit. Divide your books to fit these restrictions, and treat each pile as a separate organization task.


Large, heavy books should be shelved on sturdy shelves, usually the lowest one. Do not shelve them above head height.

, Take all the books off their shelves and place them into fiction and nonfiction piles. You're usually in the mood for one or the other, so this makes it easy to browse for an impromptu read.

, Divide a large, varied fiction collection by genre, keeping each one on a separate shelf or group of shelves. Within each genre, sort alphabetically by author's last name. If you only have two or three shelves of fiction, or most of your fiction is in the same genre, sort by last name without dividing them.


Common fiction genres include mystery, literary, young adult, fantasy, and science fiction.

, Sort your nonfiction books into separate stacks by topic. Get a feel for how much you have in each category. Ideally, you'll want about 1–3 shelves in each category. You may need to think of broader or narrower topics to achieve this.


There are many broad nonfiction topics, including gardening, cooking, history, biography, biology, and reference books.
A specialized collection can be sorted with many subtopics. For instance, a history collection can be divided by continent, then country, then time period.
If your home has more nonfiction than your local library, use the Dewey Decimal system.

Clean smudges off your dust jacket.",How to Clean a Book," Different parts of the book will require their own cleaning methods. You’ll want multiple tools on hand to address any potential problems your book may have.An artgum eraser is the perfect object for removing small pencil marks, smudges, and medium-sized blemishes on the pages.
A soft cloth such as cut-up white t-shirt works well for gently cleaning surface dirt. You can also try an electrostatic cloth for an option that both lifts and holds dirt.
You’ll need a small, soft brush, such as a toothbrush, to clean bindings and page edges.
If your book is extremely dirty or dusty, you might need to vacuum the surface. You’ll need a vacuum with a low-suction setting and a soft-brush attachment.A document cleaning pad, which is a sieved cloth filled with eraser dust, will help remove a layering of dust from the pages, as well as smudges from matte dust jackets.;
, You’ll need a few different supplies to deal with your book’s various components and unique trouble spots. Be sure to have access to petroleum jelly, a book cleaner putty, absorbent paper towels, and baking soda., Once you’ve collected all your supplies, set them up in a well-lit, comfortable work area. You’ll want plenty of space to spread out in an area you don’t mind getting a bit dirty.

, Your book will need to be supported as you clean it. Use pads that keep the book partially but not completely open as you turn the pages. This will prevent the binding from breaking.








You can use clean, rolled-up towels to create a homemade wedge for the book, or you can purchase a set of foam wedges.

, Check the book over and make a list of all the areas that need to be cleaned. Place small pieces of paper in between the pages that you’ll need to clean in order to bookmark them.








, You don’t want to add to the grime or oils that may be plaguing your book by touching it with dirty hands. Even if you think your hands are clean, you have natural oils on your skin that it’s crucial to remove before starting the cleaning process.







, Keep the book firmly closed and use your soft cloth or toothbrush to gently brush the edges of the pages. Start at the top, or head, and wipe away from the spine. Continue with the fore-edge, or the edge opposite the spine, and the tail, or bottom of the book.








Use extreme caution with any tears or damaged edges. Use the soft brush to very gently address these spots.

, Wipe the spine with your cloth or brush, moving in one direction only. In order to protect the boards, mentally divide the front and back cover into halves and wipe from that center rather than from one end to the other.








If the spine has raised horizontal bands, wipe across rather than up and over the bumps.
Be careful of any damaged edges, leather corners, or decoration. Avoid snagging the brush or cloth on these elements.

, Ensure that your attachment is an extremely soft brush, and place your vacuum on the lowest possible setting. Gently and carefully vacuum up the dirt, moving in only one direction. Start with the head, move to the fore-edge, then the tail, and finally finish with the spine and outer boards.








For damaged books, place some cheesecloth or a nylon stocking over the end of the vacuum. Vacuum up the dirt on the medium setting without touching the book by hovering just above the surface of the book.

, Many books now come with dust jackets. These paper coverings are generally glossy or matte in finish. While they’re attractive, they often get dusty and may also tear. Use your soft cloth to gently brush any dust or dirt off the jacket.

, Set the book in your wedges, carefully open the book, and turn the pages. Use your soft cloth or toothbrush to wipe the page from the center of book outwards, removing dust as you go.







, If your book has a musty smell that you can’t isolate to individual pages, place the book in a plastic, resealable bag with a sprinkling of baking soda or unscented cat litter. Leave it in the bag for a minimum of 12 hours and up to two weeks.







, Always erase in one direction only. Use your soft cloth to brush away eraser crumbs when finished.









While the eraser should remove most pencil and some pen marks, it likely won’t take care of dark stains. Dark ink or food stains may be impossible to remove from your book without damaging the pages.

, If any pages show signs of insects, brush off the insect or egg debris, place the book in a fully sealed plastic freezer bag, and then put it in the freezer for 24 hours to kill any remaining infestation. Thaw the book slowly by first putting it in the refrigerator for 8 hours.







, Book cleaner putties have the consistency of Play-Doh and can be purchased in small tubs. Take a small amount and roll the putty in your hands to warm it up, then gently rub the warmed ball over either the pages of your book or a cloth cover. Move in one direction only.







, Oil and grease stains may be difficult to completely erase, especially if they’ve had time to fully set in. Try pressing paper towels in between the pages of the book, close the book, and weigh it down with a book weight. Allow the towel to absorb the stain for 2-3 days, then check on its progress. Keep repeating as necessary.








If your stain is from food, remove this first. Freeze the book for 24 hours and then gently scrape off the food with a plastic knife.To make a homemade book weight, fill a cloth bag with dry beans or rice. Ensure the bag is sealed before use.

, Depending on the material of your dust jacket, you’ll need to use a different material for cleaning. These materials will clean your jacket without damaging it.









For a matte dust jacket, which will not be shiny in appearance, gently address smudges by shaking your document cleaning pad to release the eraser dust. Then rub the dust onto the dust jacket, and gently brush it off when finished.For a glossy dust jacket, rub a bit of petroleum jelly onto any smudges with a soft cloth. Use a different cloth to wipe off the jelly and fully remove the smudge."

Sort by size.,
Place books based on color.,
Arrange by frequency of use.,
Divide based on your reading plans.,
Create a chronology of your life.,
Reserve a shelf for your favorites.",How to Organize a Bookshelf2," Consider this if you have books ranging from trade paperbacks to oversize art albums. Place the tallest books on the lowest shelf, placing smaller and smaller books as you move upward. This creates a tidy, organized appearance. On some bookcases, this is a necessity to adapt to the height of each shelf.

, This system looks great, but are best used if you have only one bookcase. In larger collections, they can make a book difficult to find. In addition, you need to consider that you may have to split books from a series, when they do not have the same colour. Here are a few sorting systems based on spine color:


One color per shelf (a blue shelf, a green shelf, and so on). If you're having trouble filling a shelf, wrap some of the books in kraft paper.A gradual ""rainbow"" flowing from one color to the next, or from the most saturated colors to pastels.
A pattern that creates a flag or other simple image when the whole bookcase is filled. This is time-consuming, but impressive.

, This is a great system if you consult your books frequently for research or reference. Keep the ones you use daily on the shelf at eye height. and a couple shelves below, where you can easily see and reach them. Books you only use occasionally go on the lowest shelves. Books that you almost never open go on the shelves above your head.


If you have enough books to fill two or three bookcases, fill the most visible bookcase with the important books. If you have an even larger collection, this system may not work well.

, If you have a large number of books you'd like to read, why not give them their own shelf? Keep an empty shelf on the same bookcase so you can slot the finished books back easily. You might want to revisit your organization once you're through your reading list, but this can be convenient in the meantime.

, Fill the top shelf with books you read in early childhood, and move down adding books in the rough order you discovered them.This one works best for books with strong associated memories – and for people with strong memories as well.

, No matter which system you chose, you have the option of leaving one special shelf. Usually the most visible one, this is where you keep your first editions, your signed copies, or the books that have changed your life.

Create a dark backdrop (optional).,
Collect possible decorations.,
Start with the largest objects.,
Shelve books in different orientations.,
Use small decorations for contrast.,
Shore books up with heavy objects.,
Leave plenty of empty space.",How to Organize a Bookshelf3," The bookcase will look more striking if the backdrop is darker than the surrounding walls and shelves. Consider painting the back of the bookshelves to create this vivid effect.For open-backed bookshelves, hang a cloth between them and the wall.

, Know what you'll be working with before you start filling the shelves. Vases, fancy tableware, figurines, trinkets, candlesticks — your house is your oyster. Gather more things than you think you'll need, so you can test more options.


Vertical, straight-lined objects look similar to the books. This creates an austere, rigid appearance. A few bowls, baskets, or other round objects lead to a friendlier atmosphere.

, Set aside the largest decorative objects, and oversize books if you have them. Space these out along the bookcase, leaving plenty of space between them to create separate focal points. A zig-zag pattern works well, placing these on the left end of the first shelf, then the right end of the second, then the left end of the third., Catch the eye for longer by varying the position of your books. Stack books on top of each other on some shelves, and vertically next to each other on others.


Try a pyramid of books, topped with a small trinket., As you place your books, add a decorative object wherever it looks needed. Use colorful objects in contrast with drab book covers, or vice versa. A pair of tall candlesticks frames a row of short books nicely.

, Bookends come in handy and a variety of decorative shapes. Alternatively, you can use any heavy object to keep your books in place.

, Gaps often look better than a shelf clogged with paperbacks and origami. This is especially important for open-backed bookcases placed in the middle of a room, which need a large amount of space to let light through.

Determine how you think of books.",How to Organize a Book Collection1," Do you categorize them by story type, color, size, genre, title or author? There are as many ways to organize books as there are people. What really matters though, is that you pick the method that appeals or makes the most sense to you. By doing so, this will trigger your memory and help you to locate the book you want quickly.
The following sections set forth various tried-and-true methods for organizing a book collection; it's recommended that you pick the approach that appeals to you the most.

"
"
Brainstorm names of potential people.,
Make a list of people who are not appropriate for this dedication.,
Make a list of the book’s themes.,
Brainstorm reasons why you want to dedicate the book to someone.,
Fulfill a promise or request.,
Choose something that’s not a person.,
Start off the dedication simply.,
Reflect your personality in your dedication.,
Reflect your relationship with the person you’re dedicating the book to.,
Reinforce your book’s central message or theme.,
Use a quotation or poem.,
Browse dedications from your favorite authors.,
Double-check spelling and grammar.,
Finalize your formatting.,
Tell the person you’re dedicating your book to.",How to Dedicate a Book," Make a list of people who you might dedicate a book to. These might include your spouse or partner, children, parents or friend. Who is most important to your project and your inspiration as a writer?


You might have a person in mind who is the very reason that you’ve written this book. Your book might be about that person or written in their memory. This person might be a natural choice for the dedication.
Consider if you actually know the person to whom you’re dedicating the book. You can also brainstorm names of people that you don’t know personally but whom you admire.;
, The book’s subject matter, for example, might mean that a certain person is not an appropriate choice. For example, if you have a book with troubling or adult subject matter, you may not want to dedicate the book to a child.

, If you don’t have a specific person in mind to dedicate your book to, think about dedicating it to someone who tirelessly supports the themes in your book. This might help you figure out who might be the best person for your dedication.

, You might dedicate a book to someone because they inspired you or because they encouraged you to become a writer. Think about how certain people contributed to your overall writing career. Think too about how they may have contributed to this particular project., You may have promised a spouse or friend that you’d dedicate your first book to them. You may want to fulfill this promise by dedicating your book to them. Similarly, someone may have asked that you dedicate the book to them.Don’t feel too obligated to dedicate your book to someone who asked for the dedication. It is a deeply personal process to write a dedication, and if it doesn’t feel right to choose that person, you can choose someone else. Be prepared, however, to explain to that person your reasons why they were not chosen.

, There is no rule that says you need to choose a person for your dedication. You might choose a pet, for example, or even an object that particularly inspired you as you worked on the book.


For example, Robin Hobb, in her book “Ship of Magic,” dedicated the book like this: “To caffeine and sugar, my companions through many a long night of writing.”, Many dedications use the words “To,” “For,” or “In Loving Memory of.”Some of the most heartfelt dedications are the simplest ones, using only a few words.


F. Scott Fitzgerald dedicated several of his books like this: “Once Again to Zelda.”King C. Gillette dedicated his book, The People's Corporation, like this: ""For mankind."", If you are a very formal person, a light-hearted and humorous dedication might seem out of character. Similarly, if you are casual, your dedication might not be overly formal. Think about how to reflect your personality and character in your dedication.In the dedication to his book Anansi Boys, Neil Gaiman takes a humorous approach by dedicating the book to an unnamed ""you"": ""You know how it is. You pick up a book, flip to the dedication, and find that, once again, the author has dedicated a book to someone else and not to you.
Not this time.
Because we haven’t yet met/have only a glancing acquaintance/are just crazy about each other/haven’t seen each other in much too long/are in some way related/will never meet, but will, I trust, despite that, always think fondly of each other!
This one’s for you.
With you know what, and you probably know why.""

, You might write a very personal dedication, or you might even use an inside joke.Carl Sagan dedicated his book Cosmos to his wife: “In the vastness of space and immensity of time, it is my joy to spend a planet and an epoch with Annie.”
Tad Williams dedicated his Otherland book series to his father in a funny and endearing way: “This Book is dedicated to my father Joseph Hill Evans with love. Actually Dad doesn’t read fiction, so if someone doesn’t tell him about this, he’ll never know.”, Some books have a very clear theme and it is a natural fit to use the dedication as a place to thank someone for their contribution to that theme.


For example, Vaughn Davis Bornet dedicated his book, Welfare in America, to someone who worked to improve people’s welfare: “He devoted his life to the administration of government and voluntary agencies formed to help the starving and homeless.”For a children’s book about a rat, Beatrix Potter wrote a dedication to her pet rat: “In remembrance of 'SAMMY,' the intelligent pink-eyed representative of a persecuted (but irrepressible) race. An affectionate little friend, and most accomplished thief!”The dedication to the first Lemony Snicket book was simply: ""To Beatrice-- darling, dearest, dead."" The dedication for each subsequent book continued the joke about Beatrice's deceased-ness. This dedication helps set the tone (darkly humorous and ironic) for the whole book., There might be a quotation or short poem that you love, or that you think is particularly inspiring. You can dedicate your book to someone and use the quote or poem to say what you want to say. Or, you might just use the quote or poem and skip the person’s name altogether.


Quotations can come from someone well-known, or it could be a quote from someone you know.

, Search online for book dedications and see how others have honored people in their lives with a sincere or humorous dedication.

, Have a few other people read your dedication. Make sure your meaning is clear and that things are spelled correctly. Have your editor read through it.

, Most dedications are centered on the page. Some, however, might work better to be aligned to the left.


For some types of dedications, you might preserve the original formatting. For example, if you are including a poem as your dedication, you should use the original formatting of the poem, rather than making up your own.

, Let this person know that your book will be dedicated to them. You don’t necessarily need to give them a chance to decline the dedication. But giving them a heads-up might be a courteous thing to do. Fans might respond to the dedication – hopefully in a positive way – and it would be helpful if the person knows about the dedication.

Clean off sticky residue.,
Absorb smells.",How to Clean Old Books1," Hold the book shut and blow the dust off each edge of the pages. Remove stubborn dust with a clean, dry paint brush, or a soft, new toothbrush.;
, This is softer than a rubber eraser, but you should still use it with great care to avoid tearing the paper. Work with the art gum eraser only on one direction.


If you don't want to visit the art store, you can pick up some pencil marks with a piece of soft white bread.

, This is a soft and pliable putty that will remove grime and smoke residue from pages and from fabric bindings. Just roll it gently over the grime to pick up the dirt.

, Apply a little clear shoe polish or cleaning polish with a soft cloth. Test on a corner of the book first to make sure it doesn't remove any ink. Wipe off the polish with a clean cloth after you've removed the dirt.

, Carefully clean fabric covers with an art gum eraser or a slice of white bread. Excessive dirt may require a cloth dampened with fabric softener, but be aware this increases the risk of damage or mold. Make sure the book is fully dried before storing.

, This is only recommended on paperback covers and waterproof dust jackets. You can also try this on especially stubborn dirt, if you accept the risk of further damage. Here's how to minimize this risk:


Take a cloth made from microfiber or another lint-free material.
Rinse out the cloth with very hot water, then wring it out thoroughly.
Wrap a dry towel around the cloth and wring it out again. Remove the cloth, which should now be barely damp at all.
Carefully wipe away dirt from the cover, and very lightly from the page edges.
Buff with a dry cloth immediately afterward.

, Label adhesive or other residue responds well to a little baby oil or cooking oil on a piece of cotton wool. Press firmly and work in until the glue lifts. Remove the oil with a clean piece of cotton wool.


Oil may cause stains on some material. Test on a corner first.

, If the book smells musty, put it in a container with something that can absorb smells and moisture. Try a sock filled with cat litter or rice, or place the book on newspaper dusted with talcum powder.


Sunlight will make this most effective. Dappled shade is a compromise that will reduce color fading.

Start with a two-gear train.,
Count the number of teeth on the drive gear.,
Count the number of teeth on the driven gear.,
Divide one teeth count by the other.,
Start with a gear train of more than two gears.,
Divide the teeth numbers of the drive and driven gears.,
If desired, find the gear ratios for the intermediate gears.",How to Determine Gear Ratio1," To be able to determine a gear ratio, you must have at least two gears engaged with each other — this is called a ""gear train."" Usually, the first gear is a ""drive gear"" attached to the motor shaft and the second is a ""driven gear"" attached to the load shaft. There may also be any number of gears between these two to transmit power from the drive gear to the driven gear: these are called ""idler gears.""


For now, let's look at a gear train with only two gears in it. To be able to find a gear ratio, these gears have to be interacting with each other — in other words, their teeth need to be meshed and one should be turning the other. For example purposes, let's say that you have one small drive gear (gear 1) turning a larger driven gear (gear 2).;
, One simple way to find the gear ratio between two interlocking gears is to compare the number of teeth (the little peg-like protrusions at the edge of the wheel) that they both have. Start by determining how many teeth are on the drive gear. You can do this by counting manually or, sometimes, by checking for this information labeled on the gear itself.


For example purposes, let's say that the smaller drive gear in our system has 20 teeth.


, Next, determine how many teeth are on the driven gear exactly as you did before for the drive gear.


Let's say that, in our example, the driven gear has 30 teeth.


, Now that you know how many teeth are on each gear, you can find the gear ratio relatively simply. Divide the driven gear teeth by the drive gear teeth. Depending on your assignment, you may write your answer as a decimal, a fraction, or in ratio form (i.e., x : y).


In our example, dividing the 30 teeth of the driven gear by the 20 teeth of the drive gear gets us 30/20 = 1.5. We can also write this as 3/2 or 1.5 : 1, etc.
What this gear ratio means is that the smaller driver gear must turn one and a half times to get the larger driven gear to make one complete turn. This makes sense — since the driven gear is bigger, it will turn more slowly., As its name suggests, a ""gear train"" can also be made from a long sequence of gears — not just a single driver gear and a single driven gear. In these cases, the first gear remains the driver gear, the last gear remains the driven gear, and the ones in the middle become ""idler gears."" These are often used to change the direction of rotation or to connect two gears when direct gearing would make them unwieldy or not readily available.Let's say for example purposes that the two-gear train described above is now driven by a small seven-toothed gear. In this case, the 30-toothed gear remains the driven gear and the 20-toothed gear (which was the driver before) is now an idler gear.

, The important thing to remember when dealing with gear trains with more than two gears is that only the driver and driven gears (usually the first and last ones) matter. In other words, the idler gears don't affect the gear ratio of the overall train at all. When you've identified your driver gear and your driven gear, you can find the gear ratio exactly as before.


In our example, we would find the gear ratio by dividing the thirty teeth of the driven gear by the seven teeth of our new driver. 30/7 = about 4.3 (or 4.3 : 1, etc.) This means that the driver gear has to turn about 4.3 times to get the much larger driven gear to turn once.

, You can find the gear ratios involving the idler gears as well, and you may want to in certain situations. In these cases, start from the drive gear and work toward the load gear. Treat the preceding gear as if it were the drive gear as far as the next gear is concerned. Divide the number of teeth on each ""driven"" gear by the number of teeth on the ""drive"" gear for each interlocking set of gears to calculate the intermediate gear ratios.


In our example, the intermediate gear ratios are 20/7 = 2.9 and 30/20 = 1.5. Note that neither of these are equal to the gear ratio for the entire train, 4.3.

However, note also that (20/7) × (30/20) = 4.3. In general, the intermediate gear ratios of a gear train will multiply together to equal the overall gear ratio.

Wash your hands before touching your book.,
Support the spine when removing a book from a shelf.,
Don't write in your book.,
Avoid reading your book in or near water.,
Don't eat or drink while reading.,
Avoid bending the spine too much.,
Bring your book back inside if you read outdoors.,
Avoid leaning on your book to write.,
Keep track of the due date.,
Return your book on time.",How to Care for a Library Book1," The slightest bit of dirt or oil on your hands can discolor or damage the pages and binding. Work up a good lather with the soap. Focus on your fingertips and the palms of your hands. Rub your hands together long enough to sing the “Happy Birthday” song., Place your index finger and thumb on either side of the top of the spine. Then, pull it toward you. Avoid pulling on the top edge of the spine with your index finger. You could end up tearing the spine., Avoid marking the pages or binding with ink, marker, or highlighter. Don't even make light pencil marks. You can unintentionally damage the pages when you erase., It could fall into the water and be completely ruined. If you need something to read near the pool or in a boat, read a magazine or newspaper that you plan to recycle. If you feel the urge to read something while in the bath, finish up and dry off completely before picking up your book., Stains and spills are difficult to remove. They can obscure the text and make the pages difficult to read. Keep the book away from your eating and drinking space during mealtime., Forcing an open book to lie flat can damage the spine and cause pages to fall out. If a book is old or tightly bound, avoid cracking the spine at all. When you're scanning or photocopying pages, don't press on the spine.If the book is a paperback, don't bend the front or back covers. Read your book on a flat surface whenever possible. Otherwise, position your thumb on the bottom of one page and your pinky on the bottom of the other to keep the book open.

, Rain and direct sunlight can damage your book. Even if you only get up for a few minutes and intend to go back outside immediately, take your book with you. Your plans could change or you could forget about your book., Pens and pencils can leave indentations on book covers. If you press too hard, they can tear through the paper and mark up the book. Lean on a table or desk. If that's not an option, use a folder, binder, or clipboard., Make a note of the due date as soon as you check your book out. Request a “date due slip” if the library offers this service. Set an alert in your calendar with an alarm the day before the due date. Ask the library if they send automatic emails when the due date is close., In many cases, libraries have only one copy of each book. If you keep your book out too long, it's not fair to the next person who needs it. Honor the due date. If you receive a recall notice, bring your book back as soon as possible for the person who requested it.Renew your book if you're not finished with it by the due date. Ask the library staff if you can renew your book online. If this isn't an option, ask if you can renew over the phone.

Shelve all of your books alphabetically by author or title.",How to Organize a Book Collection2," This method will work well if you're good at remembering titles or names. Putting books by the same author together helps you find a book in a series easily.


This method is less successful if you're the kind of reader who remembers content but can barely recall the name of the author or the book. In such a case, you'll need to try a different approach.
Alphabetical division may also need to take into account fiction and non-fiction division (see Subject Method below for more suggestions).;
"
"
Place the books on the shelf according to size.,
Sort books by color.",How to Organize a Book Collection3," It is best to put larger, heavier books on lower shelves and smaller, lighter books on higher shelves; this is a basic principle to ensure that you stabilize the bookcase. This method is visually appealing and appears neat, as there is a size order. If you remember books by their size or shape, this method might be just right for you.

, For some people, the book's color or colorful style/depictions on the book's cover is highly memorable and instantly draws you back to each and every book read. And if you love arranging things by color in your home, this could be a great décor statement as well as an easy to way to retrieve your books.

"
Sort your books by topic.,
Determine the shelf space required for each topic.,
Place the books by topic selection on the shelves, together with others of their genre.,
Choose an identifying mark for each subject or genre.",How to Organize a Book Collection4," This means dividing the books into what you see as distinct topics, such as placing all the romance books in one pile, all the science books in another, philosophy, biographies, how-to manuals, etc. into another pile.


Consider dividing fiction and non-fiction. You might like to make a distinction between fiction and non-fiction books––this method tends to encourage this division naturally. Such a division can be done on the same bookshelf, for example by placing all fiction novels on the top shelf and all woodworking manuals on the bottom shelf. Or it can be done by using different bookshelves across the house, for example, keeping cookbooks in the kitchen and romance novels in the bedroom.

, It's always wise to assume you need more space rather than less, since it's likely you'll add to your collection over time and somehow, stray books will always turn up in need of shelving!

, In some cases, as shown in this image, you might like to add some relevant items to the shelf as well, such as figurines, photos or collectibles.

, This method is optional if it's already easy for you to remember where you've placed the books by topic. But if you need to further clarify the topics, some easy methods to adopt include:


Colored Stickers: Choose stickers with permanent adhesive from a library supply company, or be prepared to cover the sticker in permanent tape. Avoid packing tape and scotch tape as they yellow, crack and peel, while duct tape becomes gooey over time.
Colored Cloth Tape: Permanently adhesive colored tapes work very well for this task.
Written symbols: Use a permanent marker to write a letter(s) or identifying mark for each subject or genre. For example: ""R"" for Romance, ""M"" for Mystery, ""R"" for Religion, ""B"" for Biographies, etc. Unfortunately, not all books are the same color, so what shows up well on one cover may not show up at all on a different color; as an exception for books that use the same color as your label, consider opting for a white label and use marker in the chosen color.
These are great to use if you move frequently and need your book collection to stay relatively intact when packed.

If you keep a book collection on your desk, organizing it can help make your work or study more effective.,
Use a very small part of your desk for your book collection.,
Arrange the books according to frequency of use.",How to Organize a Book Collection5," Take a look at what books are currently sitting on your desk.


What sorts of books do you consider necessary for a desk book collection? Usually it will be books you need to reach for almost every time you're at your desk, such as dictionaries, reference manuals, computer troubleshooting manuals, guides for writing, editing or calculating, books that are currently important for an essay/report/book you're preparing, etc. Books that are not likely to be as necessary could include manuals you'd check no more than once every few months, novels you're meaning to get around to reading and books that are more interesting than what you're supposed to be getting on with! Remove anything that isn't in frequent use or is serving as a distraction.

, The basic rule of books on a desk is to keep them to a minimum. The desk is an area for papers, the computer and spreading out open books that are in use. Anything else is extraneous and risks getting in the way, especially with a small desk.


Ideas for shelves on or near desks include: a small portable shelf that can be picked up by hand with the books still on it; books held upright between portable bookends; shelving hanging above the desk on the wall; or simply leaning books up against the wall if the desk sits against a wall.

, Put the most used as near to your reach as possible, and the lesser used but still useful ones can be placed further away from where you're seated. Keep it simple.


Get into the habit of always returning books to their proper shelves after using. Books piling up on a desk can demotivate you from getting back to study or work and isn't very organized.

"
"
This technique can also be a sub-technique.",How to Organize a Book Collection6," It only works if you store books in more than one place (different shelves on a bookcase doesn't count, but different bookcases does. You may also have other book storage places). This is also similar to desktop organisation, but for the whole room.


Decide where you read the most
Organise all your books by how often you will (or when you will next) look at them. For example, if you intend to start reading a book as soon as you have finished your current one, move it closer to your reading area. However, if a book is a book you will only occasionally use / aren't going to read until you have read numerous other books, you may want to move it further away.
Remember that this technique can be used with other techniques.

Dry out wet books.,
Freeze books affected by pests.,
Check for signs of mold.,
Repair the book's binding.,
Seek professional advice.",How to Clean Old Books2," Books which have been subjected to water damage, immersion or a spill need to be dried slowly and carefully. An airing cupboard is ideal, but you may use a surface next to a radiator or a sunny window. Open the book to allow the air to circulate and gently turn over a few pages at regular intervals to prevent sticking. Once dry, press beneath several heavy books to flatten pages and restore the appearance.


Don't be tempted to use a hair dryer, oven, or fan. This can easily damage pages and loosen them from the spine.

, If the book is full of tiny holes, or if bits of paper flake off when you move it, it could be infested with book mites or other paper-eating pests. To prevent further damage, seal the book in a freezer bag with the air squeezed out. Place the bag in the freezer for several weeks to kill off insects and eggs.

, Mold usually causes a strong musty smell. Any book with warped binding, wet or stuck-together pages, or obvious water damage is also at risk of mold. Unfortunately, mold damage is extremely difficult to repair without hiring a professional. Store the book in a warm, dry location to minimize further damage.


If you see a furry white or grey mold on the pages, gently wipe it away with a soft cloth.

, In severe cases, you can repair the binding or make a new one. While not difficult with practice, it's best not to try this on rare or valuable books.

, Any librarian or rare book dealer should be able to advise you on more specialized cases. If you have a valuable or antique book, consider hiring a professional archivist to make the repairs.

Find the rotational speed of your drive gear.,
Plug your information into the formula S1 × T1 = S2 × T2.,
Solve.",How to Determine Gear Ratio2," Using the idea of gear ratios, it's easy to figure out how quickly a driven gear is rotating based on the ""input"" speed of the drive gear. To start, find the rotational speed of your drive gear. In most gear calculations, this is given in rotations per minute (rpm), though other units of velocity will also work.


For example, let's say that in the example gear train above with a seven-toothed driver gear and a 30-toothed driven gear, the drive gear is rotating at 130 rpms. With this information, we'll find the speed of the driven gear in the next few steps.

, In this formula, S1 refers to the rotational speed of the drive gear, T1 refers to the teeth in the drive gear, and S2 and T2 to the speed and teeth of the driven gear. Fill in the variables until you have only one left undefined.


Often, in these sorts of problems, you'll be solving for S2, though it's perfectly possible to solve for any of the variables. In our example, plugging in the information we have, we get this:
130 rpms × 7 = S2 × 30

, Finding your remaining variable is a matter of basic algebra. Just simplify the rest of the equation and isolate the variable on one side of the equals sign and you will have your answer. Don't forget to label it with the correct units — you can lose points for this in schoolwork.


In our example, we can solve like this:
130 rpms × 7 = S2 × 30
910 = S2 × 30
910/30 = S2

30.33 rpms = S2
In other words, if the drive gear spins at 130 rpms, the driven gear will spin at 30.33 rpms. This makes sense — since the driven gear is much bigger, it will spin much slower.

Use a bookmark.,
Keep your book in your bag when you're reading on the go.,
Avoid lending your book to others.",How to Care for a Library Book2," If it's raining, put the book in a plastic bag before taking it out of the library. If you don't have one, ask a librarian. Avoid stuffing paperback books in your pockets, where they could get bent or torn. Keep pens, pencils, highlighters, and markers in a separate compartment from your book if you put it in your book bag., Animals can chew your book. Small children can draw on it or tear the pages. If you share your home with animals and/or children, place your book on a tall shelf, dresser, or bookcase when you're not reading it., As soon as you bring it home, put your book neatly on a sturdy shelf or table. Don't leave it on a sofa, chair, or bed. Someone may accidentally sit on it and damage the cover or pages. Avoid places where your book could get wet, such as a sink edge or near a bathtub.Make sure your storage place isn't near heating vents or radiators. Heat can cause books to dry out and become brittle., Any flat piece of paper or paperboard can serve as a bookmark. Don't dog-ear pages to keep your place. Avoid using a pencil or other bulky object. It could bend the cover or pages out of shape. Don't tent the book open to hold your place. Avoid sticky notes, which can leave adhesive on the pages.If you're feeling crafty, try making your own bookmark from any number of materials.

, You don't want to leave your book at school, on the bus, or at a friend's house. Put it back in your bag when you're finished reading. Then, close your bag securely to prevent your book from falling out.

, If they lose it or destroy it, you'll have to pay for it. Many libraries will notify patrons when books are returned. If someone wants to borrow your book, tell them to ask the library about this service. You can also have them accompany you when you return the book so that they can check it out that day."

Use chrome to plate metals subject to corrosion, including steel, brass, copper, aluminum, and stainless steel, for decorative purposes.",How to Chrome Plate1,"


Chrome reflects brighter, clearer, and with less distortion than other finishes, such as paint.
Decorative chrome plating electroplates nickel and chrome onto a target object, such as a wheel rim or a hood ornament.
The nickel is the source of the slickness, shine, and resistance in the chrome plating.
A very thin layer of chrome keeps the nickel from tarnishing, scratching, and rusting.;

Choose between bonded and riveted friction material.,
Think about your driving requirements when choosing a brake pad material.,
Decide between organic, semi metallic, fully metallic and ceramic break pad materials.,
Opt for semi-metallic brake pads for regular driving.,
Review the entire break system when replacing the brake pads.",How to Choose the Right Brake Pads1," All brakes need to have a softer friction material attached to the stronger metal backing plate. Brake manufacturers use two methods to attach the friction material to the backing plate: bonding with an adhesive or riveting with high strength rivets.

There’s no clearly superior method for attaching the friction material, but bonding allows the brakes to last slightly longer because as the friction material wears down, the rivets make contact with the brake rotors or drums and squeal a bit when they’re nearly worn out. By the time you hear the squeal of rivets making contact with the rotors or drums during braking, it’s time to change the brakes anyhow.



 


Bonded brakes wear down to the backing plate which usually ruins your rotors or drums if not changed promptly when the metal to metal grinding sound is heard when applying the brakes.





;
, Purchasing replacement brake pads or shoes will require you to make a choice about the material they are made from. At this point, you need to determine how severe your braking needs are. Some things to consider include:


How mountainous is your driving?
How hot is the climate you live in?
What are the traffic patterns you travel in?
How tolerant are you to brakes that squeal a bit?
Do you pull a trailer behind your vehicle ?
Do you have to deal with deep puddles in the winter or rainy season?

, Before choosing a brake pad to shoe material, it's important to consider the pros and cons of each.


Organic: Some cars come with brakes which are made from an organic material. This provides good life for the other brake components, but don’t offer superior braking when pulling a trailer or traveling long downhill routes. Additionally, organic brake material does lose a lot of braking capacity when they get wet.







Semi-metallic: A better braking material is called semi-metallic, in which a composite of soft metals are embedded in the friction material which enhances braking . However, this does wear out the rotors or drums a bit faster than the organic materials.







Fully metallic: The next step up in price, quality and braking efficiency is fully metallic brakes which offer great braking in almost any condition, but do wear the rotors/drums faster.







Ceramic: These are more expensive than the other 3 choices but do offer the longest life and best warranty. Ceramic brakes tolerate very high temperatures with very little fading or loss of braking when wet. , Semi-metallic brake pads tend to be a great all-round choice for commuter vehicles, and they’re very reasonably priced.

Most newer vehicles come with semi-metallic pads or shoes, as these are what car manufacturers recommends. Even vehicle that have rotors made of harder metals tolerate the semi-metallic pads very well.






However, if you regularly use your vehicle for more heavy-duty tasks — such as pulling a trailer up a mountainous path — you may be better off going for higher-end, fully metallic or ceramic brake pads.






In other words, you need to seriously consider your regular driving conditions and how much stress will be placed on the breaks when choosing the right brake pad material — it's a matter of safety.







, It’s always wise to consider the entire brake system when you perform a repair yourself or have it completed by a service shop.

The brake pads can be no more effective than the quality of the rotors they contact and the master/slave cylinders that move the pads in and out to perform their functions.






It’s also wise to flush the old brake fluid out of the hydraulic system when if the vehicle or truck is over 8 years old just to keep the moisture levels low and brakes working at their peak levels.

Understand why you need to change your wiper blades.,
Consider your options for changing the blades.,
Know what part of the wiper blade you'll need to change.,
Look at the shape of the blade.,
Measure or look up the length of the blades that are used on your car’s driver seat and passenger seat sides.,
Check for adapter options.,
Consider cost.,
Purchase and install the new blades.,
Raise the metal arm up and away from the windshield, until it holds steady in a position perpendicular to the windshield glass.,
Find a latch behind the adapter, simply press it and the wiper blade will slide down.

,
Remove the old wiper.

,
Gently rest the bare hook against a cloth on the windshield.,
Clean windshield and blade with mild soapy water and clean dry with a clean towel or cloth.

,
Install wiper blades on the vehicle and remove the protective squeegee cover.,
Place the wiper blades back onto the windshield glass lightly.

",How to Choose Windshield Wiper Blades," The blade of a wiper is made of rubber; thus, it will naturally wear out after several months of wiping off snow, rain, and dust, from your windshield.;
, Some consumers will take the car to an auto maintenance garage and ask the mechanic to change the rubber blades, or the whole wiper blade. The new blade will likely cost from fifteen to twenty dollars, plus a fair labor cost of around ten or twenty dollars. The alternative is to buy the wiper blades from chain store, or from the internet and install them yourself (an easy process).

, In general, windshield wiper blades are made with three basic parts:


1. The lower metal arm is the part that extends from the base of the windshield;
2. The wiper blade is the part attached to the metal arm; and
3. The rubber blade is the part that actually wipes the snow, rain or dust off the windshield glass for you.

, Many modern cars have curved windshields, so the blade needs to curve too, to make good contact as it wipes. There are many brands of wiper blades with various kinds of packaging, some of which you can see through and some of which you can't. Straight wiper blades are suitable for car with a flat windshield, while slightly curved wiper blades may be more suitable for car with streamline windshield.

, You can measure the length of each blade yourself, but in general, most places that sell wiper blades provide a manual where you can look up the lengths for your car make and model..

, Many wiper blade brands include more than one adapter type in their packaging. These are designed to make the blades compatible with various types of metal arm.

, Different kinds of wiper blades can range in price dramatically. Do a little comparison shopping to figure out what wipers fit your price range and are still of good quality.

, When you're ready with your new blades, you can install them yourself to save labor costs of a mechanic. The process is simple, as outlined in this section.

, Be careful, since the metal arm is spring loaded and could snap back and crack the glass.

,,, The cloth also protects the glass from being scratched, if for some reason the wipers unexpectedly swipe.

,, See the insert in the package for detailed installation instructions.

Once you have your letters, cut around them to create a box shape. Glue the letter onto a piece of cardstock. Wait for the glue to dry, then use an Xacto knife to remove the white border from your letter so only the letter remains.Fonts with straight lines work better than fonts with lots of intricate details.
Use your letter stencils to trace letters onto a piece of canvas and paint the letters different colors for a cool piece of lyric art.;
, To do this, you will need a pencil, an eraser, a ruler and some black markers of varying thicknesses. Using your ruler, draw three lines on your paper: a baseline, an x-height and a cap height. The base line is where you’d like your letters to sit. The x-height is how tall you’d like your lower case letters to be and your cap height is how tall you’d like your capital letters to be.Once your guidelines are drawn, make a rough sketch of all your letters. Do multiple drafts until you like the way one of them looks.
When you land on a draft you like, use your pencil to flesh out all the letters. Make sure you make each letter the same thickness.
Go over your letters with your black markers. Use your eraser to wipe away any remaining pencil lines.

, Start by finding an alphabet template online. Print out the letters and cut each letter with scissors or an Xacto knife. Trace each letter onto a piece of fabric. Cut the fabric letters out using fabric scissors or pinking shears.Pin your fabric to a piece of cardboard to keep it from moving while you trace and cut.

Learn the difference between brake pads and brake shoes.,
Understand why disc brakes are superior to drum brakes.",How to Choose the Right Brake Pads2," Brake pads and brake shoes are different from one another. The brake pad is built for disc brakes found on most front axles of cars and trucks. Brake shoes, on the other hand, are built for drum brakes which are often found on the back axles of cars and trucks. The reason behind these two different designs can be found by examining the braking sequence:

When you actuate the brakes of your vehicle, the disc brake pads or brake shoes have to slow down the brake rotors or drums mounted between tire rims and the suspension. The friction of the disc pads squeezing the rotors or pushing the brake shoes outward on the drums in order to slow the vehicle down causes the disk pads or shoes to get really hot.






On long downhill runs, there is a lot more stress placed on the front brakes (and therefore the front brake pads) than on the back brakes. For this reason, a superior braking method is required for the front brakes in order to handle this extra stress.







, As mentioned above, the disc brakes located at the front of the vehicle are required to handle more stress than the drum brakes at the rear of the vehicle. As a result, they need to be of a higher quality.

Disc brakes were developed by race car and aircraft designers who wanted to find the best way of slowing down the machine without burning up the brake shoes. They were later introduced to the front axles of commercial vehicles in order to reduce the wear-and-tear on the front brakes.






The rear axle, on the other hand, doesn't have nearly as much force on it during braking, and since brake drums are cheaper and easier to manufacture, these are the more common form of brakes on the rear of most passenger cars and trucks.






However, more modern performance cars and heavy duty trucks usually have disc brakes on both axles (front and rear) because of their superior braking capacity. Disc brakes handle heat a bit better than drum brakes too, which means they still work well when they’re hot. Any braking system can develop fading from heat or water but disc brakes recover from those two issues quicker than drum brakes.

Think about the number of seats you need.,
Choose a minivan that has the door style you like.,
Determine the safety features that appeal to you.",How to Buy a Minivan2," Most minivans feature 7 seats, but a few models boast 8 or 9. Most minivans allow you to easily remove or fold down at least one row of seats, which is something to consider if you want extra cargo space and only need seating for 4 or 5 people.

, Some vans only have a sliding door on one side, while other newer models offer doors on both sides of the vehicle. Some minivans allow you to open the doors with the press of a button.

, Rear backup alert systems, traction control, and headlights that stay on in the day can all make it a bit easier to drive safely. You should also consider whether you need side air bags, or perhaps the kind that can sense whether there is a passenger in the seat. Make sure it has a rearview camera - rearward visibility in a minivan when reversing is minimal at best.

, For this project, you will need a freshly washed and ironed white pillowcase and a black Sharpie fabric pen. Choose a song lyric that is particularly meaningful to you and using your Sharpie pen, write it across both sides of the pillowcase.Place a sheet of cardboard between the pillowcase to keep the words from bleeding onto the other side.
Depending on your preferences, you can use a ruler to center the words, or freehand it.
Give your pillowcase 24 hours to dry before washing.

, For this project, all you’ll need is a white coffee mug and food safe permanent markers. Wipe down your coffee mug, then use your favorite lyrics to create a design on your cup. Bake your mug at 375 degrees for 40 minutes.Be careful not to smudge your design; the marker will still be wet until after your bake your mug.
To keep your mug from cracking, allow it to heat up and cool down in the oven.

Study the script.,
Ask the director about any plans, themes, or necessary props he/she wants to be incorporated.,
Sketch a mock-up of the set design.,
Decide if you're going to build the set or use an existing location.,
Draft a budget for your set design.",How to Make a Movie Set1," The script is the most important part of a movie. It has information about the story, characters, plot and all the things that will happen in the movie. Studying the script thoroughly will you give you an idea about how the set should look. Take detailed notes on the script, making a list of the following:


The setting. This includes the time period, geography, and ambiance.
Crucial background props. What props are named in the script? What parts of the scene do the character need to interact with (a TV, an oven, the blinds, etc.)?
The mood of the script. Comedic and light? Dark and serious? Somewhere in between? This will profoundly impact your color choices.
How many characters will need to fit into the space. If it is too big, the actors can be swallowed by the space, but if it is too small it will be awkward to film in. Remember, you can also use space size as a stylistic or symbolic element.
Will the location need to be designed from the ground up (like a spaceship) or can they be adapted from pre-set locations, such as a house?;
, You must remember that, above all, you are there to contribute to the director's vision for the movie. They may give you some pointers, or they may give you free reign to do what you want. Some directors, like Wes Anderson (Grand Budapest Hotel, Rushmore), have detailed and meticulous approaches to set design. Other just want an unobtrusive, natural looking environment. You should ask about:


Any tone, mood, or theme he/she wants to keep.
Any color palettes that should remain consistent. The movie The Fall, for example, uses deep, contrasting primary colors to distinguish its locations and characters.The budget. How much money do you have on props and set decoration?
Extra props/furniture. Is there anything the character uses that isn't in the script?

, There is a variety of ways to do this, but your basic goal is the same: show the director the ""set"" before you spend a dime. The most common professional way to do this is through ""sketch-up,"" which is an architectural drawing of the scene, like this one for ""Good Night, and Good Luck."" This, however, takes a lot of time, and may be counterproductive for smaller movies. You can also try:Photography. Create a small book of photos of props, locations, and rooms found online or in real life, then talk to the director about ways to redesign the rooms in the photos to fit the movie. You can also cut and paste photos together.
Drawing. Simply sketch out the rooms on pencil and paper. You usually want a top down view of the set, listing all furniture, walls, doors, and windows, and a more artistic, cinematic drawing of the room.
Other films. Pull up clips and shots from other movies you might want to emulate, then discuss how you'd change things to make them unique. Showing the director other movies can give a sense of how set design impacts the final film., There are pros and cons to both strategies, and you may use both existing locations and pre-built sets on the same movie. This is the most crucial decision you'll make when designing a movie set, as it will wildly affect the budget, scene, and filmmaking process. This decision is almost always made with the director.



Building a Set: This gives you full control over the set design. Usually, you build a 3-walled room, like a theater stage, then stock it will all of your props and designs. The camera crew then uses the space of the missing 4th wall to film. While the creative freedom is great, set building is expensive and takes a lot of time to get right.

Shooting on Location: This is when you adapt a pre-existing location into a set. It is cheaper and faster, than set building, but comes with its own concerns. You must be sure you have permission to shoot there, and that the set won't be altered or adapted while you're not filming. You also need to be sure that actors, cameras, lights, and sound equipment can all fit, and you can make any changes necessary for the film.

, Though budgeting is usually the least fun part the whole process, it is an essential skill for everyone involved in filmmaking. You do not want to be halfway through a set or movie and realize you've run out of money for an essential prop, and the only way to avoid this is to budget. Go online to check out prices of essential props and think about which ones you can make yourself.


Make sure you've called and checked if there are any fees to use existing locations as well.

Protect your images.,
Open accounts on social media sites like Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter.,
Create a website.,
Post artwork on a free online art database like Visual Art Source, Deviant Art or Art 3000.,
Blog about art.,
Sell work on eBay.,
Make You tube videos of paintings in progress.,
Submit your art to an online magazine.",How to Put Artists' Work Online," You can watermark your images using Photoshop or Google's Picasa picture program. Always attribute the image of artwork to an artist. You want your photos to be shared, but it is essential that the artist's name follows that image as it gets passed on. Some artists choose to encrypt them on their website; however, this may inhibit sharing an artist's work through some of the art channels in this article.;
, If you are an artist, create pages on all of these sites to share your artwork to different audiences. If you are running a gallery, make sure you have a page dedicated to your gallery on more than 1 social media site, where you can post artwork from many artists and update fans on your gallery's events. When you are naming your social media sites, make sure your username is close to your own name or your gallery's name in order to create a brand that users can easily recognize.


Facebook allows you to create Fan pages or Group pages. Fan pages are designed for businesses because people don't have to ask to see your pictures and contact you, where Group pages are designed to promote discussion based on a selected topics and you must request to join to see content. When you create your Facebook account, whether you are an artist or gallery, you are technically a business that wants to get images out to a wide audience, so choose the Fan page rather than a Group page. Post albums of pictures on your Facebook Fan page every few weeks. Make sure to post links to your site, comments or single pictures at least 3 times a week, to ensure your Fan Page will show up on your Fans' Home pages. Create an invitation to gallery events or open studios and invite all of your fans. Encourage the fans of your page to invite other people. Look into Facebook's low-cost, click-based advertising system for Fan pages, if you are getting a lot of interest directed to your site from Facebook. They will use a photo of your choice to create an ad that will appear in the right hand column of Facebook pages for the demographic of your choice.






Twitter is a great option for networking within the gallery or art community. You can ""follow"" art fans, and they may follow you in turn. Most of the art is shared through links so it will need to be posted on a website or blog first. The link will redirect followers to the art. To have success with a Twitter account, you need to post links to artwork on a website every day or every other day. Twitter moves very quickly and old posts are hard to find.






LinkedIn is a professional networking tool. The user base is slightly higher in age than Twitter or Facebook. LinkedIn is especially useful for galleries because it focuses on business details of the gallery. You can connect with current and past employees and current artists. People on LinkedIn choose to follow businesses to see their news. Galleries can post links to their website and they can post press releases or links to news stories about artists. Although there are few places to post pictures on the site, like Twitter, you can use links that lead to your website to connect your followers to your images.







, Like most businesses in the 21st century, galleries must have websites to promote themselves and their events online. Although some older clientele rely on postal mailings and email or written newsletters, the Internet is highly visual and allows galleries to advertise a large amount of their artists' work. It is a good idea to pay a professional to produce a visually stunning website that will enhance the artists' work rather than detract from it.


Artists and art students can also make websites using template systems, like ArtDealers.com or Other People's Pixels, or a gallery database like Masterpiece Online. You can also buy a domain name and produce the site on your own if you are familiar with website development. There are a growing number of website-making companies that cater to artists. They can produce slide shows and use high-resolution images for a fee of around $200 (123 pounds or 139 euros) or more per year. Some sites will give you a free 30 day trial before committing to the site. You may also receive a URL with your name in it, which will help people to find you more easily on the Internet.

, Sign up for an account, upload art, and spread links to the work online. A limited amount of artwork posting may be free, but posting a portfolio usually comes with a fee.

, WordPress, Blogger or other free blogging sites design templates for artists and art lovers. Sign up for a free account and choose a theme that focuses on photography or art and allows you to upload large pictures. Blogging must be done on a consistent daily, or at least weekly, basis to develop a fan base.

, Start an account with eBay and set it up to receive funds. A growing number of artists now bypass galleries and go straight to auctions on eBay. This is a great option for a prolific artist who produces art on a consistent basis. At the beginning, these eBay art auctions will produce low bids and then the bids increase as the artist develops a fan base. Set a low minimum bid to start with and then raise it as the number of bids increases.

, Art collectors love to see artists in the process of making their art. Videos are great marketing tools that can be featured on Facebook, blogs or on websites.

, For example, Square Cylinder, Juxtapose, Art Net, Art Limited and Visual Art Source all cater to artists and art events. Many of these sites offer artist user accounts. Sign up for free, choose if you want the basic account or if you want to upgrade and then upload a portfolio. The magazine's readers can browse through the artist lists to find you.


Find the ""Contact Us"" section of these websites to submit art story ideas. You can often submit events through an online form and upload images of your work.

Go location scouting.,
Discuss what parts of the room you want to use.,
Think of the room's ""lines"" when designing.,
Build, design, or buy essential crafts and props.,
Remember that less is more.,
Remove or cover up any brand images.,
Light the set with the cinematographer.",How to Make a Movie Set2," Grab a nice camera and hit the road. Try and get 2-3 set options for each scene you have to design. Take shots of every single angle of the room, using as much lighting as you possibly can, so that the director knows exactly what the space looks like. On the way take pictures of furniture, decorations, or props that you think are a good fit in the set. Other things to jot down include:


The dimensions of the space. Whenever possible, make accurate measurements with a tape measure-- there is a lot of film equipment you'll need to fit in the set.
Any fees or stipulations for the set. For example, you might be able to shoot in a public school classroom during the summer, but it will be nearly impossible to film in fall when all the students are back.
What are the power capabilities of the set? You need to plug a lot of things in to make a movie.
Hows the ambient sound? Will people be walking through the set, and is that okay for the script?

, In most cases you will need to design 2-3 walls, such as the ones behind two chatting characters. However, if the director wants to use the entire room for filming then you need to be sure that the entire set looks like it could be in a movie.


Where are the characters moving through the set? This is called blocking, and you should push the director to make a decision now so that you aren't redesigning the set on the fly when shooting starts.

, Lines create the illusion of movement for the audience, which makes a set design dramatic and engaging. Line is everywhere -- the tops of couches, the floorboards, the horizon-- so don't interpret this as pinstripes. Remember that a set is a 3D space, but the audience perceives it as a 2D space, like a photograph. Thinking of your set like you were composing a photograph will always lead to more interesting designs.How can you get the illusion of depth in your set? What lines of perspective, furniture, and decorations will lead the eye to the most important prop/character in the scene?

, There are hundreds of DIY solutions to set design, but these take time. You need to use your budget to balance the speed of buying everything with the creative control of building the whole set. Your design needs will change from set to set, but there are some key principles to keep in mind:


How essential is a prop to a shot? If it is just a piece of background material you can often get away with a cheap, quick prop, as it will likely be blurred out anyway.
Posters may help decorate a room, but they can also look cheap. Buying several inexpensive poster frames, however, can give the room a much more high-class feel.
Make or buy one large centerpiece if you are on a budget. What is the focal point of the scene, and how can you make that as great a prop as possible? 90% of viewers will be focusing on that object the entire time, such as the couch two characters are sitting on., Unless the point of the scene is that things are cluttered and chaotic, less is more in the scene. You don't want the audience focusing on your set, you want them focusing on the actors and action. A great set is unobtrusive -- it feels natural and realistic, less like a set and more like a room you could visit in real life.


While you can think of many extravagant, complex sets (The Royal Tenenbaums, The Great Gatsby, Blade Runner, etc.) these are not exceptions to the rule. Rather, the sets in these movies are made to fit a lush, extravagant, or chaotic script. Thus, they appear natural in the world of the movie.

, It actually costs money to show that ""Kitchen-Aid"" logo on the mixer in the corner. While it is unlikely that you'll get sued for anything, there is no need to take the risk. Whatever brand logos you can remove, cover up, or hide need to be covered up.This is done because a brand may not like how you use it in a movie. No toilet paper company, for example, want to see their product used by a serial killer to wipe up blood.

, After lighting, there is a good chance you'll need to redesign the set a bit to eliminate awkward shadows or fit in lighting stands. This is also a chance to put in any ""practicals,"" which are lights that appear as part of the final movie, like lamps or ceiling lights.


The cinematographer is also in charge of camera placement, meaning this is the time to work out crew placement and check how your scene looks at specific camera angles.

Build ""flats"" to make fake walls for any movie set.,
Lay your Masonite on the ground to measure out the frame.,
Place 2 of your 3x8 wood pieces along the long side of the wood.,
Measure the distance between the two long pieces of wood.,
Lay your two cut planks along the top and bottom edge of the Masonite.,
Hammer your frame together using 1.5"" nails.,
Apply wood glue to the entire frame and press the Masonite onto it.,
Nail the entire Masonite Board into the frame.,
Attach your final 3x8' piece of wood into the back of the frame, on the center.,
Cut your plywood in half diagonally.,
Cut a one-foot notch in the center of your plywood's hypotenuse.,
Use a power drill to screw the plywood into the frame.,
Use the flats to create the walls of your set, then begin decorating.",How to Make a Movie Set3," Flats are ubiquitous in set design, as they are the foundation of any hand-made set. Flats are always 4x8 feet large, and are quickly and easily decorated to look like a home or room. Though it takes some carpentry and tools, flats are actually pretty easy to build. To make one 4x8 foot flat, you will need:


1 4x8' sheet of Masonite.
5 pieces of 1""x3""x8' wood for the frame.
1 4x8' sheet of plywood for the jack, or base.
Wood glue and a box of 1.5"" nails., Put the piece of wood on the ground so that you can accurately measure out the size of your frame on it's back. The frame will surround the edges of the Masonite, like a a picture frame.

, The 8-foot long wood should fit perfectly along the long sides of the Masonite. Make sure they are flush with the edges and that the thin side (1"" thick) is the one touching the Masonite.

, The smaller end needs to go inside the longer pieces, so you'll have to cut one plank of wood roughly in half to make the frame. If you used 1-inch thick wood, the two shorter sides should be cut to 46-inches long, since the wood is 4 feet (1.2 m) wide, minus an inch for the width of the long planks on the edges. Still, you should make this measurement before cutting to double check.

, The entire outside edge of the wood sheet should be framed by your wooden planks, with the two shorter sides tucked inside the longer 8-foot planks.


Cut a third piece to this exact length as well and fit it into the middle. The whole frame It will resemble a classic two-part window frame when you are done.

, Simply put a nail into every joint. You will be doing more work later to hold it together, so these 6 nails (2 for each horizontal slat) should be fine to start.

, You don't need too much, as you'll be using nails as well. Have a friend help make sure that the edges of the Masonite are flush with the frame.

, Start with the four corners, then put as many nails as possible into the board to attach it to the frame.

, Lay the piece down so that the wide side is flat in the center of the frame, then use a power drill to put pilot holes into the frame and wood piece. Use long wood screws to attach the wood to the frame. The result will be one long piece down the back of the frame, almost like a wooden pallet.


Use two screws along each horizontal wooden part of the frame. This long piece in the center attaches your flat to the stand that will hold it up.

, This is your stand. It will act like the stand on the back of a picture frame, holding your flat up so that it doesn't fall.

, The hypotenuse is the longest side of the triangle. Cut a rounded notch into the center of this side, cutting down roughly a foot or so. This notch is where you can drape a sandbag or weight to hold the flat down., Attach the plywood on either side of the wooden board running down the middle of the frame. Remember, your goal is to use the plywood like the back of picture frame, helping the flat stand on its own. Again, drill pilot holes into the plywood and frame, then use wood screws to adhere the two together. 6-8 evenly spaced screws should work fine.


To make it easier to work, you can also use wood glue along the edge of the board before attaching the screws.

, You'll have a lot to do, painting the walls to bringing in furniture, accents, and lights, but this is the best way to have full control of your set design."

Talk to them about the type of show you want to have and ask about their process for new radio show hosts.


Make sure to secure radio time on the same day and time each week or day to help build up a larger listenership of people who can expect to hear your show at a certain time.If you’re looking to be a radio DJ and play music, contact stations that play the type of music you would want to play, i.e. alternative, country, rock, etc. The same goes for spoken audio shows: you will want to reach out to public talk radio stations about your news or documentary style show.
If you’re in high school or college, talk to your school’s radio station about hosting your own show and what’s required for you to do so.;
, Tape a radio show using whatever equipment you have available and broadcast it online for the potential of having listeners from all over the world. Broadcast a show live online, or make it available through a podcast service.


Podcasts are a very popular off-shoot from live radio broadcast, and a great option if you want to produce a radio show but can’t find a source to broadcast it live. Starting a podcast allows you to pre-record and edit a show before releasing it on the internet.Try free programs like Spreaker, Radionomy, or BlogTalkRadio that can help you to record, edit, and broadcast your own radio show., Create your own independent radio show using equipment available to you. Edit it and submit it to radio show contests for the chance to have it featured on a popular station or outlet, and possibly even secure your own regular broadcast.


Submit your radio show to a local radio station if they’re holding a contest for amateur radio show hosts, or to a larger network of radio stations like iHeartRadio for even more exposure.Find support and the potential for an ongoing podcast series with programs like Radiotopia., Listen to a wide variety of other radio shows of the type that you’re interested in, whether it’s a talk show, documentary style, or music program. Take notice of the elements that other shows have to help guide what you want to do.


Pay attention to the things that another radio show does that keep you engaged and listening. Does the host give fun facts about the music they’re going to play or just played? Are the interviews interesting and easy to follow? Try emulating these elements in your own show.
Also take note of the things in a show that make it drag or make you dislike it. Are there too many pauses? Is the host’s voice too monotone or too fast? Think of how you can avoid these things in your own radio show., Think about and write down all the basic information about the radio show you want to create. Decide on the following key elements of your show:


Name: Consider carefully the name you choose for your show, as it is the only thing that will stay the same in your broadcast.
Objective: What do want to accomplish with your show? Is it to inform (informational programs, documentaries), to entertain (musical shows, radio theatre), to do a public service (interviews, reviews, special programs), etc.?
Theme: What will you talk about? Decide on a theme or category for the type of content you produce.Schedule: Decide on a length of time for each broadcast, how often it will air, and for how many weeks or months. Of course, this will be decided by a radio station if you broadcast through one.
Audience: Who’s listening? Consider what age group, location, and other demographic categories you are hoping to have as key listeners.
Show elements: What are the features of your broadcast? Are there interviews? Music? Live callers? Special guests?
Advertising: If you need or want advertising to support your radio show, you’ll need to seek out sponsors, record advertisements, and decide how and when they’ll be placed within your show.

, Select the songs you’ll play during a radio show that features music selections. Create a playlist or upload songs so that they’re ready to play during a live broadcast or to combine with spoken recordings for a pre-recorded show.


In general, choose the highest quality studio recording of a song, unless you specify that you’ll be playing a live or unusual version. Remember to find the “clean” edits of songs that omit curse words if you’re broadcasting on live traditional radio.
If taping a show that you will edit and put online, you should also record and prepare “wraps,” which are the spoken segments that introduce or recap the music played. You’ll want to edit the music files slightly, with fades or seconds of silence, so the wraps fit in more seamlessly., Plan for an informative, educational, or entertainment radio show that uses primarily spoken audio. Arrange interviews, narration, investigative research, and any other elements necessary to put together a complete story or theme.


Conduct quality interviews by maintaining a casual, conversational style and asking your subject further questions to get more information or simply to find a piece of tape that is memorable or noteworthy for your overall story.Note that if you’re conducting a live interview, as in one with someone live in the studio or calling in over the phone, you should do a pre-interview. This allows you to pose all the questions you will ask in the real interview so your subject is prepared for them and you know how they will answer.
Write out an outline for the entire “story” you’re trying to build to make it easier to get the interviews you need, information you want, and “scenes” you’d like to create., Write down what you will say during your show, whether it is narration to tell an overall story, questions to ask an interview subject, or wrap portions between songs in a set. Lay out a basic outline, or a more detailed word-for-word script.


Even if your show’s dialogue is meant to be spontaneous or improvised, you should still jot down a general guideline for what to say, points to discuss if you draw a blank, and general lengths for each segment so you don’t talk too much and run over your time.
If you’re hoping to have spontaneous dialogue or fill more time, consider having a co-host or accepting live callers. A co-host you can get along with provides easy banter and contributions so the pressure isn’t all on you, and live callers provide an element of unexpected content., Get a full tour and tutorial of equipment you’ll use for broadcasting your show through a local studio. Learn all of the functions of the technology you’ll use (like microphones, speakers, sound mixers, etc.) during live broadcasts so you feel confident operating them on the air.Ask if you can “shadow” another radio show host to get a better feel for how equipment, signals, and procedures go during a real broadcast to learn each step as they go.
Or ask if you can do several “dry runs” or demos before going live yourself. This sort of training is typically required by stations anyway.
Make sure you understand how to troubleshoot or solve problems with the equipment you use. Though there may be a technician around to assist you if something goes wrong during a broadcast, it’s always best to know how you can address the issue yourself to fix it right away.

, Speak slowly and carefully on the radio so that listeners aren’t guessing at what you say or having to adjust their volume. Remember to follow guidelines for appropriate language on the radio, and consider what’s appropriate content for your target audience.


Consult the FCC’s guidelines and your station’s own rules for what words are prohibited live on air. This should also inform what song lyrics you need to edit or not use if playing music.
Note that while your intended audience may be adults commuting to work during your morning show, you may have listening children at that hour as well, for whom adult themes wouldn’t be appropriate. The FCC prohibits obscene content on the radio from 6 am to 10 pm.If something goes wrong, like a live caller who’s using inappropriate language or topics, know the procedures in place with your studio and equipment on how to take yourself or a caller off the air and start playing music or another segment.

, Make sure to repeat the basic information about the radio station you’re broadcasting from, as well as your name and/or the name of your show. Remember that listeners could tune in at any time during your show segment, and want to identify what they’re listening to.


A radio call sign is the string of four letters that designates the unique transmitting station. The frequency is the number that listeners dial on their radio to get the station’s broadcast. Usually both of these are used to announce and market the station.
Consult the staff at your station for their guidelines on how often you should be reiterating the station’s information, as is may vary by station or show. In general, you should introduce the station and your show’s name at the beginning of every wrap portion between music or advertising.
Even if you have a pre-recorded show or podcast, you may want to repeat your show’s name after any advertisements you may have included. While you aren’t “marketing” your show or a station as you would with live radio, you can still get the name of your show out there to help get more listeners talking about it on social media, blogs, etc.

, Record the audio for your independent radio show, including any narration, wrap portions, sound clips, or interviews you might include in your show. Use any recording equipment you have available to you, or just the built-in microphone in your computer or phone.


If you’re using external equipment, just make sure you can easily sync your recorded material with your computer or whatever device you’ll use for editing.
If you’re making a show for music, make sure you have all the music files you want to play available on your computer or other device.
You can also choose to record directly within a computer or phone application that let’s you edit the audio as well. Check out popular apps like Spreaker or Audacity to do this.

, Import all of your audio files into an editing program that allows you to cut, move, change, and add effects to your audio to turn it into one complete episode of a radio show. Be sure to make copies and save your work in case you lose something accidentally.


Find free editing software that’s easy to use by opting for an application like Audacity, Acoustica, or WavePad.Try out premium editing software like FL Studio, Adobe Audition, or Sound Forge if you’re really into audio editing and need a full suite of controls.While the editing will depend on your own content and style, some good practices to keep in mind are to edit out unnecessary or very long clips, create space between songs and sections using fades or music, and don’t leave more than a few seconds of empty silence in a recording.

, Upload your final episode of a radio show onto any platform that hosts audio files or radio shows. Then distribute it using social media sites, a blog, a website, etc.


Choose a platform for all sorts of audio by uploading your radio show to a well-known service like YouTube, iTunes, or SoundCloud. These have large audiences for the potential to gain more listeners.
Try a platform specifically for hosting radio shows, like Archive.org, Podomatic, and BlogTalkRadio, which may have additional helpful tools to schedule the release of your episodes."

Stretcher bars usually come pre-packaged so that you will always get two smaller bars, and two larger bars (two for the sides of your picture, and two for the length of your picture).
You will also need to pick up the following items: heavy-duty staple gun, 5/16 inch heavy-duty staples, an iron, a hammer, 2 eye hooks, and some picture frame wire.;
, Slide the notched ends of the stretcher bars into one another, making each corner a 90 degree angle. Make sure that you place a small bar, next to a large one, next to a small one, next to a large one (how a normal picture frame looks).Give each corner a gentle tap with a hammer to make sure each notch is securely in place.
You can also use glue if you choose to help secure the notches. Before you slide them into one another, apply a small amount of wood glue to the receiving end of the notch. Then slide in the bar, hold for a few minutes at a 90 degree angle, and lift away.

, Take your piece of fabric and lay it on a flat surface, such as an ironing board. Do so, so that the design is facing downwards. Set your iron to the low setting, and gently press against the back of your fabric. Work it to the left and the right in order to smooth out the entire piece.Let your fabric rest and cool. Place your already made frame on top of the fabric (on the back of the fabric). Use a ruler to measure 2 inches of fabric on each side of the frame.
Use a pair of scissors or a rotary blade to cut the fabric at this 2 inch mark all the way around the frame. If you decide to use a rotary blade, make sure that you use a cutting board so that you don't cut through your table.

, Start on whichever side you like. Bring up the fabric around the middle of the side, and staple it through to the wood. Make sure that the fabric is pulled tight. Work towards each of the corners, placing staples about an inch apart each. Pull the fabric tight with each staple.Repeat the previous instruction for each of the sides. If you think that the fabric is too loose underneath one of the staples, use a staple remover, and re-staple your fabric.
Important: leave the fabric on the corners loose. Do not staple the corner fabric down.

, It is best to use a pair of scissors for this, rather than a rotary blade. However, do not cut off all of the fabric, just a good inch or so of the excess. Do this for each corner. After you have the fabric cut, lay one side of the fabric down against the frame, and lay the other piece on top of the other.Staple two staples into these two pieces, each staple about 1/4 inch separate from one another.
Go around and give a gentle tap with a hammer to any staples you don't think have fully sunk in.

, Screw in two eye hooks to the top bar you wish to hang the fabric from. Put each eye hook about an inch inward on each side of the bar. Cut a piece of wire, and feed each end through both of the eye hooks. Curl the wire on each end so that the wire is tight.Remember, you do not want the wire to show when you hang it up. If your piece is too long, either curl more on both ends, or cut a new piece of wire. You only want about 1/2 inch of lag.
Once you have attached the wire, hang it up on your wall.

Gather your materials.,
Lay your canvas out vertically.,
Paint your canvas.,
Print out your template.,
Paint inside of your design.,
Add texture and life to your painting.,
Create loops at the top and bottom of your canvas.,
Slide your dowel rods through the loops.",How to Make a Wall Hanging2," The most important item to buy is either canvas or burlap measuring 2 1/2 feet by 4 1/2 feet. This can be found at most craft stores. You can choose any color of canvas or burlap you like, but remember that you will be painting designs on top of the material. Therefore, you should go for lighter colors, such as white or off-white.You will also need to pick up the following items: painter's tape, fabric paint, a paper plate, a small paintbrush, a template with your design of choice, sandpaper, an iron, fabric glue, two 7/8-inch dowels, two eye hooks, and twine to hang your tapestry.

, Measure, with a ruler, 3 inches from the bottom of the canvas and draw a straight horizontal line. Take a piece of masking tape that is 2 1/2 feet long and place it along this line (top edge of masking tape goes on the line).Measure 1 inch above the masking tape, and draw another straight, horizontal line.
Place a 2 1/2 foot long piece of masking tape along this line (bottom edge of masking tape goes along line).

, Place a small amount of fabric paint on a paper plate. Dip the paintbrush into the paint, and paint between the two pieces of tape. While you can slightly paint over the tape, make sure not to get loose paint on the rest of the canvas. It is best to dab rather than to brush in long strokes.Wipe your paintbrush off with a paper towel, and then run it under some hot water. This will get the excess paint off. Wait for the paint to dry before you safely remove the tape strips.
You can add more paint stripes above the one you made. Simply repeat the previous instructions, adjusting the height of each of your stripes (instead of a 1 inch stripe, you may want to paint a 1/2 inch stripe above the one you already painted).
Leave some space in between each stripe so that you can clearly see each one. Make sure not to make too many stripes, as you need some space to paint on your design.

, You will want to stick to something basic that can be identified simply by the outline of the object or thing. Many simple designs can be found online, such as animals, flowers, architecture, etc. Whatever picture you choose, print it out, and cut it out using scissors.You can adjust the picture size when you print it out to fit your canvas. You will want it no larger than 2 1/2 feet in vertical length, and 2 feet in horizontal width.
When you have cut out your design, center it on the canvas. Use a ruler to make sure that it is equidistant on the horizontal sides and vertical sides respectively.
Trace around the design with a light pencil mark, and remove the design.

, Spread a small amount of fabric paint onto a clean paper plate. Dip into the paint with your small paintbrush, and use dabbing motions on the fabric. You can choose to use multiple colors for your design, or just one. You can also add small amounts of black or white paint to create some shading.Try to keep the paint color true to the original design. For instance, if you do a piece of architecture, use brown paint if its wooden, or grey paint if it is stone.
Once you are done painting the design, set your canvas aside to give it time to dry. Meanwhile, you can rub off the excess paint on your paintbrush with paper towel, and then run the paintbrush under some hot water.

, Note: this is a strictly optional step. When your canvas is nearly dried, you can scrunch up with fabric in order to give your painting a more worn, and antiquated look. Fold it like an accordion, and immediately relieve the stress. You can also run sandpaper over the design gently. This will peel off some of the paint and create a weathered look.If you choose to do this step, you will need to iron the surrounding canvas. Iron the blank canvas around the design, using the low setting on your iron. Make sure to do this on an ironing board, or another safe surface.
Ironing the excess fabric will create a nice contrast between the antiquated design, and the smooth, soft canvas.
Once you are done ironing, let your canvas rest in a safe place so that it stays wrinkle-free.

, These loops will be used to hold your dowel rods. Once your design is completely dry, flip your canvas over. Take the top part of the canvas and curl it backwards, so that you have one inch of fabric on the back. You can crease it if you like in order to keep it from constantly curling back.Place a small amount of fabric glue on the edge of the pulled back fabric. Make sure to leave some space underneath for your dowel rod to slide through. Press the edge down onto the backside of the canvas and apply pressure until it is dry.
Do the same at the bottom of your canvas. Pull backwards an inch of fabric and fold it by making a crease. Place some fabric glue on the edge of the folded fabric (leaving space underneath) and apply pressure until it is dry.
If you do not have the patience for typical fabric glue, you can use hot glue for a faster drying period. However, make sure that you are using safe practices, not getting any of the hot glue on your hands.

, One dowel rod for each of the two loops you just created. Screw an eye hook onto each end of the top dowel (eye hooks are basically screws with hoops on the end). You should be able to screw them in by hand, although you may need to pre-drill a tiny hole in order to help expedite the process.Thread one strand of twine through both of the eye hooks. Leave some lagging twine in between so that you can hang your canvas.
Tie a knot on each end of the twine, near the eye hooks. Once you are done, hang the tapestry design on your wall.

Gather your materials.,
Prepare your yarn.,
Arrange your yarn in terms of color.,
Glue your strands on.,
Trim and be creative.",How to Make a Wall Hanging3," You will need to purchase either a 1/2 inch or 1/4 inch dowel rod. The length of the rod depends on how much yarn you plan to use for one hanging, and how many colors you wish to add to the design. You will need multiple casts of yarn in various colors. Pick up some glue and some heavy duty scissors as well., You will need yarn in multiple lengths. Take your first color of yarn, and begin to wrap it around your elbow, and in between your pointer finger and thumb. Wrap it around, creating loops. This will create strings about 24 inches long (12 inches will appear, hanging down from the dowel rod). After you are done wrapping, carefully take the yarn off of your elbow and finger crux, laying it to the side. This will be your shortest length of yarn.You need to create at least 2 more sections, each of a different color. The second section should be about 36 inches long (18 inches will appear) and 48 inches long (24 inches will appear).
You can find interesting ways to wrap your yarn, like from your arm to your foot, or between two doorknobs. You can also simply cut 36 or 48 inch pieces against a long ruler.
Set each of your wrapped yarn loops to the side, making sure to keep them in their loop form.

, Take your shortest yarn strands (24 inches) and cut them at one end of the loop with scissors. Begin to drape them over the dowel rod, making sure that the strings are equidistant on both sides of the rod (12 inches on each side). Scrunch them all together on one end of the rod.Take your next longest yarn strands (36 inches) and do the same thing. Cut them at one end, and drape them over the rod, equidistant on both sides. Scrunch them together, and slide them next to the 24 inch strands.
Do the same with the 48 inch strands. Scrunch them together and slide them together against the 36 inch strands. If you decided to add even more lengths, add them now.

, Once you have arranged the strands properly, take out your glue. Work in colored sections, starting with the shortest strands. Lift the 24 inch section up slightly and add a strip of glue to the dowel rod. Press the strands down, trying your best to keep the strings equidistant on both sides. Hold them down until the glue is fairly dried.Do the same thing for the 36 and 48 inch strands. Make sure that you apply glue to the rod, keep them bunched up, and pressed against the previous lengths.
Leave your rod somewhere safe to dry. You do not want to begin cutting the yarn until the glue is fully dried.

, First, you will need to hang your design where you want it to hang permanently. This might mean hanging it on a few nails or tacks in your wall, evenly placed on both sides. Or, you can buy eye hooks, and screw one onto each end of the dowel rod. Slide a piece of yarn through both eye hooks, and tie knots on each end. Finally, hand the string on a hook or tack.Get out a pair of heavy-duty scissors. Begin cutting the bottom of your strands of yarn at angles. There are three options you can choose: Cut every strand at one continuous angle, cut each of the separate colors at different angles, or just cut which ever way you want to.
The key is to get creative. It doesn't have to be perfect, or smoothly cut. Because this project is relatively quick, you can always make another one in a short period of time if you make a mistake. However, with this project, mistakes are really creative scissor cuts.

Learn what chest and head voice are.,
Learn what they feel like.,
To sing in your chest voice, begin speaking in your normal voice.,
To sing in your head voice, begin a high voice, but not a squeaky voice.,
Be careful.",How to Learn Head and Chest Voice in Singing," Here is a very loose explanation:


Chest voice: The lower register of your voice when you are speaking or singing. When you are having a conversation with a friend, you are likely using your chest voice to speak to them.
Head voice: The higher register of your voice when you are speaking or singing. Some people speak in their head voice when they are nervous or speaking to strangers.;
, What does it feel like to sing or speak in your head and chest voice?


Chest voice: When you speak or sing in your chest voice, it should feel like the tone is resonating in your chest. The sound should feel (and sound) like there is more power backing it up.
Head voice: When you speak or sing in your head voice, it should feel like the tone is resonating in your head. The sound should be more light and gentle than in your head voice.

, As you speak, slowly transition the words into an ""ooh"". If you had been speaking in your normal voice, the singing you will hear should be in your chest voice. Practice doing this until you are confident that you know what it feels like in your face, throat, and chest.

, As you speak, do as you did in the previous step. The singing you will hear should be your head voice. Practice until you know what your head voice feels like to you.

, It's important to take caution when you are singing! Don't try to sing high notes in your chest voice for more power. Do what feels comfortable to you and make sure not to overuse your voice!

Familiarize yourself thoroughly with your topic.,
Investigate background information.,
Distinguish romantic entanglements and platonic relationships.,
Keep up to date on fandom news.,
Follow the subject of your fandom on social media.,
Unite with the object of your fandom to support a good cause.,
Maintain healthy boundaries.",How to Join a Fandom1," Shared interest establishes common ground between you and other fans, and comprehensive knowledge expresses the high level of regard you have for your idol.There are many different kinds of fan, ranging from casual fan to superfan. Serious fandoms often rank in-group status by knowledge pertaining to their subject.Minor details, like little known side projects of individuals or historical influences, can earn you the status you need to join your fandom effortlessly.;
, As a fan, you probably feel closely connected to your topic of interest, and other fans will share this feeling. However, most people don't dig deeper than popularized facts. By researching background information, you’ll feel a more intimate connection to the source of your fandom and to other fans who have done the same. Sharing these similar experiences will accelerate your acceptance into a fandom.Wikipedia is a good place to begin your research. Though the page might be lacking in substantial content, look through citations to find sources other fans might have overlooked.
Use broader Internet search engines as well. However, take what you learn with a grain of salt. Many newspapers and magazines report unsubstantiated information as a sales gimmick; don’t believe everything you read!
Look for any books written about your fandom area. In the case of individuals, you might find a biography, even if the person is very young. A memoir might already be on the shelf — Justin Bieber’s Just Getting Started, as an example.Autobiographies allow you a less filtered glimpse into the inner workings of the writer's mind. Even so, be aware that no one wants to be viewed as a bad person. Don't accept even autobiographical accounts as purely true.



, Observing the people that surround the subject of your fandom can reveal much that isn't explicitly stated. If the subject is a person, romantic partners can more clearly define taste or personality and not knowing this information might make it difficult to integrate into your fandom. What's more, individuals and family connected to your fandom shed light on backstory.


In the case of most celebrities with well-established fandoms, a quick internet search will provide as much information about dating life as you could possibly want. This can unearth pictures that demonstrate public behavior, giving you more ammunition to prove you are a true fan worthy of your fandom.

Remember to be skeptical of celebrity gossip. Magazines with low integrity thresholds will, for sensationalist appeal, wildly speculate about celebrities when photographed with companions. If your idol denies having been in a relationship, decide who you trust more: magazines looking to make a profit or the person alleged to have been in the relationship.



, If you don’t know what’s current with the subject of your fandom, members might question your devotion. In many cases, you can subscribe to a fan mail service to get regular email updates about your related news. Another fantastic tool is Google Alerts, with which you can keep apprised of current events in your fandom.Google Alerts requires a Google account. If you don’t have one and would like to set up Google Alerts, you should create an account. With a Google account, setting up Google Alerts is as simple as:Visiting the Google Alerts pageTyping the name of your idol or a fandom topic in the box that says “Create an alert about…”
Clicking the “Create Alert” button
And adding additional alerts for any related topics or people. For example, if you want to know what your idol’s significant other or famous relatives are involved with, add alerts for them. Alerts for projects will keep you informed about career developments — film roles, clothing lines, forthcoming albums, and so on.


The latest information on Google Alert key words will be emailed to your account as it hits the web! This way you’ll always be aware on what’s going on in the fandom.

, Before the advent of social media platforms, it was nearly impossible for fans to know the day-to-day lives of the subject of their fandom beyond what was written in magazines. Today, many icons share their personal thoughts throughout the day on Twitter, which some fans use to deduce subtler details, like pet peeves or a dislike of the word “moist.” If a celebrity has an Instagram account, you can find personal, candid photographs of your idol outside of the spotlight.If you haven’t already, create accounts for the major social media platforms on which already have accounts to the subject of your fandom. Here, account curators (sometimes the subject in question, other times fans or PR agents) share information that you might want to know. The major platforms are: Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook.

Check these social media sites frequently to see what's going on with your fandom subject!
Installing dedicated apps for these platforms on your phone will enable you to respond to your fandom subject on the go or when you’re away from your computer. This can also be useful if your fandom or fandom subject is primarily based in a different time zone.


Don’t be afraid to interact with the subject of your fandom. Before social media, fans had to write letters which can be time-intensive. Tweets and comments are a quick and easy way to give feedback and get noticed.
Don’t be upset if you don't get a response. The downside of social media is that most fans have the same access as you, and they are also trying get attention. Don’t give up, though. Maybe one day, you’ll get a response!

, Through your Google Alerts, social media following, and by exploring trustworthy websites, you can uncover favorite causes and charities that reflect the views your upon which your fandom is based. You can grow closer to the heart of your fandom by learning to identify with its philanthropic efforts. Acting on these values not only has a positive community impact, it can also earn you special recognition from your fandom – and maybe your idol, too!


Promoting social causes by sharing links to charities and organizations will indicate your co-commitment with other fans.

, As an initiate to your fandom, you should sustain a high level of engagement with your subject to earn quick admission among members of your fandom. But keep your relation in perspective. Show your appreciation without harming anyone emotionally or physically. Remember that celebrities are people too, and deserve to be treated with decency and respect.


An unhealthy obsession with a celebrity is called celebrity worship syndrome, which has been shown to result in depression, anxiety, and lowered self-esteem.Your fandom should improve, not worsen your quality of life. This is about having fun!Celebrities live in a state of heightened anxiety due to constant interruptions to their personal lives and overstepped boundaries. For instance, Taylor Swift took out a restraining order in 2014 for a fan who had been stalking her since 2011, and John Lennon was murdered by an obsessed fan.By refusing to view inappropriate material on the internet or in magazines — for example, leaked intimate pictures and videos, or pictures of private property — you demonstrate that you support and love your idol while respecting privacy. You care enough about them to act in a way that makes them feel safe.

Put some thought into it.,
Notice the camera angles.,
Look at how detailed certain things are.,
Do sexy but unlikely things happen?,
Look for the obvious.",How to Identify Fanservice in Anime," Is it relevant to the plot? Certain things are allowed as a means of moving the story along. If a character is in a sexual or romantic situation that contradicts his or her personal morals (e.g. a homosexual encounter, a tryst, or an encounter with an enemy of the family), it's probably a vehicle for character development. This is also the case for situations involving a long-standing, serious relationship (as opposed to a one-night-stand) or a rape. If the event is random and doesn't really help the story (if there even is a story), it's probably fanservice.;
, Is the viewer's perspective arranged so that you're looking right up the leading lady's skirt (or down her cleavage)? Does the camera zoom in on a secretary's butt as she leans over? Is the camera placed at some other odd angle that gives you a front-row seat to a character's naughty bits? If so, it's probably fanservice. Sexual scenes that aren't fanservice actually tend to censor this sort of thing, focusing instead on artistic camera angles that complement the sexual or romantic tension of the situation.

, If every single wrinkle in a busty woman's too-small top is drawn in minute detail, or every drop of sweat on her leg is painstakingly animated as she does gymnastics, it's probably fanservice.

, Does a boy's gym uniform get stolen, forcing him to swim in his tighty-whiteys? Does a girl's shirt get caught on her chair, tearing the fabric and revealing her lacy push-up bra? Are the girls' school uniforms so short that you can see the butt of their panties as they walk down the hall? If they weren't fanservice, these situations probably wouldn't happen because they're incredibly unrealistic.

, Sparkles. Shines. Popsicles. Lollipops. Erect nipples. Boners. Bodily fluids. Lingerie. Men or women who are so well-endowed that their proportions seem physically impossible in nature. Any of these could signify fanservice.

Check your weaknesses.,
Notice areas you avoid.,
Use outside resources for help.,
Practice and draw.,
No longer avoid your weaknesses, no matter how bad you feel you are at them.,
Try taking drawing challenges.,
Do more sketches and studies, and less ""masterpieces"", or projects.,
Ask for honest criticism.,
Remind yourself of your progress.,
Know you will improve.",How to Improve Your Artistic Skills Quickly," It's okay if you're not the best artist; you don't have to mentally list every single area as a weakness. You should grade yourself based on comparing your own skills, not others.


What areas could use some improvement? Maybe your best asset is drawing faces, but you fail mostly at hands; you should note this as a weakness. Continue noticing specific places that need work. Even if you have places you have tried to fix, it's always good to keep improving things you are better at as well. Keep note; it's best to work on what's worse first!;
, Many beginning artists avoid areas and places they have a hard time on; many artists (not just the beginners) will also do this, feeling like it's easier to fly by it. Notice what kinds of subjects you shy away from.


Common places include: hands, feet, anatomy and the body, certain genders, arms (the beginning artist usually hides the arms and hands behind the person's back, and many other personal weaknesses to the artist). Mentally keep yourself aware of any, or write them down if necessary.

, For whatever art style you're going for (realistic, anime, or cartoon) you should use tutorials, YouTube videos, drawing books, and other sources to help you. Use techniques and try recommended methods. Don't slack out, follow tutorials and tips, and methods as well. If you don't use guidelines for anatomy, it will be harder in the long run. Use as much effort as you can.


Take breaks in between and inspire yourself before drawing; this helps tremendously. Keep in mind you should stay positive, take your time, and also observe others work (videos are best for observing as its in action) and learn from these experiences!

, Nothing helps like drawing; you can't get better at anything without actually doing it! If you spare time everyday to draw, it will help you. Even quick sketches and many fails will help! It doesn't have to be perfect, but remember no matter what, try the best best you can do. Within time, you will see results!

, Now that you know your weaknesses, it will be very important for you to draw in those areas, no matter how bad it is; you'll eventually get better, and quitting will not help at all!


Repeat drawing those places in practices alone, and in more complex pieces. You may feel that it ""ruins"" your drawings but its best to allow yourself to get it in a level where it doesn't using this method. After all, you won't be able to avoid it if your asked to draw it as an artist, or when you want to draw a piece with it! Don't limit your skills!

, This includes 365 day themed drawing challenges, 30 day drawing challenges, inktober, and 100 day themed drawing challenges. You can find these on the internet, pinterest, and Deviantart.


doing these will keep you preoccupied, and will give you ideas to draw from everyday.

,

studies and sketches will help you better than big pieces. Base these studies on your weaknesses.







, You may not have noticed a flaw, but getting advice after each piece helps, even if offensive, or hurtful. Accept the flaw and note it down so you can avoid making the same mistake, or so you can work on it. This makes it easier to realize your mistakes and weaknesses. Ask another artist, friend, or family member.

, If you're ever in a tight spot, remind yourself how far you've come by looking back at previous works; it may seem funny how you might've felt proud of it before, or because it was a hard fail, but seeing progress always helps in inspiring you to push farther. Tell yourself while drawing, you'll make sure you'll impress your future self.

, Even if the process is tough and troubling, remind yourself every great artist had to start somewhere. Also, art is not a natural talent. Sometimes people may be better in the start and in the learning process, but hard work is what makes an artist (and practice!) Better yet, practice where you fail so overall, you get better!

Join Tumblr, where there are many active fandoms.,
Use Twitter hashtags to find and follow.,
Write, read, and comment on fanfiction.,
Participate in web forums.,
Take part in a convention that involves your fandom.,
Join a street team.,
Build upon the relationships you’ve made.",How to Join a Fandom2," Tumblr has come to be considered the home of fandom culture, regardless of which fandom you belong to.Create a Tumblr account and page.Make sure your username and the title of your blog broadcasts your fandom affiliation. You might include information about your fandom's subject, or a fandom identifying nickname, such as a well-known project (album, film, role), or anything else that signifies your dedication to other fans.
Conduct a tag search on your fandom subject. Surf around, clicking on other fan pages. If content is related to your interest, follow those Tumblr users!

Reblog worthy content, comment on it, and “heart” it to signify you appreciate the content shared with the community. This can be the beginning of a new friendship with a fellow fan.


Share content of your own individual fan-work, information you have gleaned through Google Alerts, and discoveries from social media following.
Make sure your posts have tags relevant to your fandom, so other fans will be able to see your content in the tag search and follow you. Tumblr fandoms often make a game out of including very long, idiosyncratic tags along with the simple fandom tags; keep this in mind for when you become part of fandom culture.Be social! Building friendships with the fans you meet on Tumblr will help forge a place for you in your fandom.

, Simply “following” your fandom subject on Twitter isn’t enough to connect you with larger community of fans. Search hashtags related to your fandom to find and follow other users who share your interest.


Make sure to talk to other fans as often as possible. A fandom thrives on the enthusiasm of its members. You should make an effort to maintain the relationships you’re building to ensure the health of your fandom.

, Fanfiction — fan-generated literature about fandom topics — is a very important part of fandom culture.Though much is published on Tumblr and Instagram, there are many websites dedicated specifically to fanfiction. Prominent among these are Archive of Our Own, Fanfiction.net, and Wattpad.Fanfiction can be further classified into the subgenres:


RPFs (real person fiction) are stories about the celebrity as themselves — a story about getting married to Harry Styles, for example.
AUs (alternate universe) are stories that change the reality in which the celebrity lives. For example, you might find stories in which Harry Styles is a painter instead of a singer.
OOCs (out of character) are stories in which the author changes the celebrity’s personality or persona — for example, a story in which Harry Styles is a violent mobster.

Remember to vote for the stories you like and leave positive feedback encouraging other writers to continue producing stories you like reading.
Once you’ve read enough to be comfortable with the genre, try your hand at writing your own fanfiction to share with your fandom.



, An internet forum is a message board where you can select a topic of interest and join a conversation with community members similar to yourself. Many web forums have different expectations and culture, but the atmosphere of your web forum will typically be in line with the that of your fandom.Web forums are a great place for you to post questions, coordinate online or real-life activities, and make friends with with other fans.

, You should look up fancons, as some are genre specific, but many cons are broad enough in scope that you're sure to find some fellow fans, discussion panels, and maybe even meet the people your fandom is based upon! The major fancon genres are: anime, comic, gaming, and fantasy/sci-fi.Coordinate group costumes with your friends or other fans you've met and geek out with like-minded individuals.
Discussion panels are increasingly places where actors and writers will make special announcements. Take advantage of this and think of clever questions you can ask at a panel discussion.
Check out after parties! People come to fancons from all over, many of them for the same reasons as you. When the convention hours are up, if you're still feeling social, talk fellow fans and see if there's an after party you are welcome to join.

, Street teams are groups who promote events and products — movies, concerts, and autograph sessions, to list a few.

, If you are not able to do it yourself, get a professional to do it for you (if you don't have the money to pay for it, offer a barter or swap for your creative services or an artwork the photographer likes). Take photographs of the full artwork, but also close-up images that shows your mark-making, texture and other special details in the artwork.

, Make sure that each photograph highly matches the artwork's quality colors as close as possible. If needed, hold out your drawing and closely compare the colors of the artwork and the computer's.

, Even if you've have a photographer taking your photographs, give him/her these directions beforehand: Make sure that you have at least three copies of each photograph - one high resolution image of 300dpi, for magazine submissions and printing catalogues for exhibitions, one low resolution image of about 600 pixels wide and 72dpi for use in blogs, newsletters and emails, and a medium sized image of about 1200 pixels wide (also at 72 dpi) for online galleries.

Be snappy and quick-witted with unpredictable contestants.",How to Host a Game Show," You may not be able to make it to the big time just yet, but nothing is stopping you from getting some practice in. Invite your friends over for a special theme party where you run a live game show for their entertainment. You may not have the money to give out thousands of dollars to the winner, but maybe you can have a handful of moderately priced prizes.


This is a fun way to mix up the typical dinner party where everyone just hangs out, and it gives you a low pressure way to test your hosting skills.;
, A second way to get some practice hosting and have fun would be volunteering as host for an event hosted by an organization. Hosting for an event gives you access to a larger audience and budget than hosting a party yourself. An organization you are part of could even have a game show night as a fundraiser, with you as host.A children’s hospital, a service club like Kiwanis, or your church might have a yearly fundraiser for a certain cause, so you could ask a few places like this if having you host would interest them.
If they don’t already have a fundraiser, you could suggest a game show night with prizes donated by businesses and proceeds going toward a special cause.
A fundraiser through a church that raises money for a missions team could host a game show that focuses on trivia from the country the mission trip is going to.

, Although some game show hosts are hired solely for their personality, it is often in your best interest to have a degree in something like acting or TV production. You might be more likely to get a job as crew for a game show which could eventually lead to a hosting job. If you are serious about it, you could try cold calling television networks and asking about what it takes to land a game show hosting job.


People hired as game show hosts have often been in show business for a long time in other areas. However, channels like Game Show Network or your local TV networks may have open casting calls for new shows they are developing.
A good place to start might be at a business that hosts experiences like an escape game or endurance challenges. You might not be on TV, but could start getting hosting experience.
Another good starting option might be working for a party service where you would host games and challenges for the kids.

, If you create any of the questions, puzzles, or prompts for the game show, you want to be very careful that you only use factually accurate information. This is also a good time to check for clarity of the questions. You want to make sure there is only one correct answer and that the answer is clear and understandable.One aspect of this is making the question as specific as possible. Rather than asking, “Who directed the movie Psycho?” you should say, “Who directed the 1960 film Psycho, starring Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh?” Giving the year and the actors helps make sure the players won’t be confused, since there is a 1998 remake of the film.
An example of a question with multiple answers would be, “Who was president in 1809?” as this was a year where Thomas Jefferson ended his term and James Madison began his term.

, Part of the preparation of hosting a game show is reading through all of the questions, answers, and other script parts before the show. This helps ensure that you know all of the words that you will be reading so you don’t stumble and sound confused during the show.Some aspects of the script may need to be memorized if reading from a card or screen is not possible.
Besides reading through the material, it’s good to rehearse through the whole show to get a feel for how it flows. If you can run through the script with players, this is also a good idea.

, While you are talking to the players before the show starts, ask each person how to pronounce their name. You don’t want to make the mistake of mispronouncing it during the actual show, plus it may confuse and annoy them if you do mispronounce it. If you can make some kind of physical or mental note about proper pronunciation, this will help you during the game.Names with unique spellings like Halle (which could be Hal-ee or Hay-lee) can be tricky. You may also have names with different pronunciations like Alicia (uh-lish-uh or uh-leesh-uh).

, You may have microphones, buzzers, screens, or sound equipment that enhances the show and you want to check all of this beforehand. If there are any set pieces or props that will be part of the game, you want to make sure these are in the proper place and are easy to move if necessary., Almost every game show has announcers, prop technicians, or some form of assistant . You will be much more effective as a host if you have another person, or more, helping you. Once you have an idea what the various parts of the show are and you know what will happen within the game, get as many people to help as it will take to make the game run smoothly. You may be the host, the face of the game show, but you can’t run the whole thing on your own.You may need someone to click through slides containing questions, move game props from one place to another, or reset game pieces. Your job as host is to help your contestants play and keep your audience’s attention, so your assistant or crew’s job is to keep the other parts of the game moving smoothly.

, Even if you are hosting a very simple game show that everyone is already familiar with, it is best to go through all the rules with them. It helps the audience follow what is going on. It also helps make sure that players know what to do and what is going on throughout the game.The amount and type of information that it is necessary to tell them will depend on the game itself. If there are rounds or stages to the game, you may want to explain each part separately just before moving to that part, or explain the whole process from start to finish.
Do the contestants all play through a certain puzzle at the same time? Do they each get separate questions or chances? Can you lose money for wrong answers? This is the type of information you want to make sure they players know.
For example you might say, “Contestants will answer a series of questions, each worth a certain amount of money. You will have a chance to answer each question by being the first to hit your buzzer. If the first player gets the answer wrong, the other two players will write their answer down and being awarded half of the points if the written answer is correct.”

, Almost every game show has a little bit different format and set of rules that dictate how a contestant can win the game. As you are explaining the rules at the beginning of the game, make sure to include what it takes to win. The players might earn money throughout the game and whoever has the most wins, or they could accumulate points and the player with the most points gets the chance to win something in a final round.Consider whether or not there is only one winner, or if the players who don’t finish first still get any prizes or money. Maybe all of the contestants win something, but only the top player gets the top prize or their earnings.
If there are multiple rounds or parts to the game, explain if different players could win each section and how the final winner is decided.
You might say, “Each player will attempt to solve 5 puzzles, worth 10 points each. Whoever earns the most points will play in the winner’s circle for the prize money. The winner’s circle has five more puzzles, each worth an increasing amount of money. You win the money of each puzzle you solve correctly. Ties after the puzzle round will solve one final puzzle, the winner being whoever finishes first. Those players who don’t make it to the winner’s circle will receive complimentary concert tickets as our thanks for playing.”

, Talk to the contestants during the show to give the audience more information about them. This will help the audience connect more and make them root for a winner. You can ask basic questions like what they do for a living and what made them want to be on the show. It’s also typical to find out something interesting that the person likes or does which will give them more backstory.You could ask the players what they would do with the money if they won. Ask if they watch and play along with the game at home. Try to find out if they have done something that many people never would like skydiving.
Say, “I’ve been told that you have a knack for whittling toys out of wood. How did you come into that hobby?” Or, “Most people don’t like to file their taxes, but you have made it a practice of doing tax work for all of your friends. Why is that?”

, As the host, you are in charge of helping contestants play the game. You will be the one to move through the various sections or stages if the game has multiple parts. It is important to make smooth transitions between questions and parts of the game. If any player cheats or breaks the rules in some way, you must make this known and assign any penalty that is necessary.


Game show hosts often say things like, “That’s all the time we have for this round, let’s see what happens next.” You could say, “I’m sorry Shelley, you’ve run out of time. It’s John’s turn to give it a try.”

, If your game show has multiple players who gain points or prizes throughout the show, you should remind all the players of each other’s scores. This is a way to increase the competitiveness between the players because they will know who is ahead and who is close behind. For single player games, it helps them keep track of what they have won so far and will fuel their desire to keep playing.You might say, “It’s been a close game, and everyone still has a shot to win. Stacy leads with 1200, Rick follows with 1050, and Molly is still in the game with 900.”

, Except for rare occasions, the best game show hosts are the ones who joke with the players and make the game a fun environment. When players get wrong answers or fall behind, keep encouraging them and never humiliate them. Game shows are meant to be fun as well as competitive, so help the contestants keep a light attitude even when the game is at stake.Use the players’ names throughout the game to make them feel good.
Speak with an upbeat voice and smile a lot. This will help the players feel at ease if the game starts to get stressful.
Say, “Well Stan, you are currently behind, but this is the game of second chances, so don’t give up!” Or to a wrong answer, you could say, “No, I’m sorry. That’s incorrect, but a good guess.”

, Game shows can draw a wide array of personality types, so it is important to manage the players if you have someone who is a little far out there. You have to still be friendly, but if you have a player who is being sarcastic or sassy, you can try to make it something to joke about to keep them in the spirit of the game.With particularly difficult contestants, hosts sometimes cross the line between joking banter and insulting. You want to make sure you keep it friendly.
You could say, “Can someone check Stacy’s buzzer, she seems to be a little behind.” But don’t say, “Whew, Stacy, you really don’t seem to understand this game at all.”

Examine your strengths as a performer.,
Write down what your weak points are.,
Know what makes you unique as a performer.,
Make a list of the shows you want to get booked in.,
Let people know you would like to be booked.,
Look back on your career and ask yourself why you entered the business.,
Ask yourself what you want to get out of the business.",How to Get More Burlesque Gigs," It's easy to spend hours focused on why you aren't booking (too old, too short, too fat, too thin, not classic enough, not edgy enough), but focusing on these things won't get you more work. Instead, focus on what makes you a good performer.;
, Yep, time to be honest with yourself. If you have no idea what your weak points are, then ask a friend who will be honest with you. Not good at dancing? Take a dance class. Not good at being on time? Learn to pack the night before and set your alarm to remind you to be at a show 30 minutes early.

, Remember, if you're performing in a saturated market, then you better stand out or as the old Stephen Sondheim song says, ""Gotta Get a Gimmick."" Okay, so you don't have to ""bump it with a trumpet,"" but you should aim to be the best at whatever you do even if what you do has been done by many.

, Once you know which shows you want to work in, take a careful look and see if those shows currently have performers that look like you or offer your skill. Ask yourself it these shows could benefit from your service. If you only do neo-burlesque and you want to work in a venue that only hires classic burlesque, then unless you are going to start doing classic, you may have an uphill battle convincing them that they need to add neo-burlesque to their line up.

, Seriously, this may seem silly, but so many performers make the same mistake. They post on Facebook that they are available. They stop by a show and tell a producer, they are available. They wait for the phone to ring or the emails to come in. Sorry, but that doesn't work for actors or models, so why on earth should it work for burlesque performers. Yes, it's good to post on Facebook, but also, contact those shows you listed in the previous step and ask about getting booked. Sure talking to a producer in person is great, but if you are chatting at that producer's show, then chances are they are talking to a lot of people. Follow up with an email letting them know you liked the show and would love to work together.

, Yep, once again, you've got to ask yourself the tough questions. Why did you decide to start doing burlesque? Was it on a dare? Did you have a friend who enjoyed performing and told you to try? Did you want to be the next Dita Von Teese? The next Gypsy Rose Lee? Did you see Christina Aguilera's, ""Burlesque"", and hope to conquer a little nightclub while developing legions of fans? This step is super important because, without it, you can't move on to the next step.

, Do you still want those legions of fans? Are you hoping to make enough money to retire? Do you just want to make some extra money while making new friends? Do you want to simply feel beautiful? Understanding why you want what you want will help you to understand whether you can still get what you want from the business or if you will never get what you want. If you aren't getting what you want out of performing burlesque, then you either need to repeat steps 1-6 or accept that it's time to move on.

Try to identify the purpose of the work.,
Describe your own reaction to the work.,
Back up your interpretation with examples.,
Decide whether you think the work is successful or not.,
Explain how you are judging the work.,
Summarize why you think the work is successful or unsuccessful.",How to Critique Artwork," This is the sort of thing you’d find on a museum or gallery label, or in the caption in an art book. Knowing the background of a piece can make a big difference in how you interpret and understand it. Start your critique by providing the following information:Title of the work
Artist’s name
When the piece was made
Where it was made
The types of media used to create the work (e.g., oil paint on canvas)
The exact size of the work;
, Using neutral terms, describe the artwork. Your description should include things like the form and scale of the work. If the art depicts figures or objects rather than abstract shapes, describe what is represented.For example, you might say, “This is a small-scale portrait painting of a young woman, shown from the mid-torso up, against a dark background. She is clasping her hands in front of her chest and looking up and slightly to the viewer’s right. She wears a pink dress, and a long veil that falls behind her head.”
Avoid using terms like “beautiful,” “ugly,” “good,” or “bad.” At this point, you’re just talking about what you see, not judging the art!

, Now describe the work in more detail. Talk about the way the art uses these five basic elements of art and design: line, color, space, light, and shape., Lines in a work of art can be either literal or implied. Different types of lines can create different moods or effects. For example:Curved lines can create a calming effect, while jagged lines might feel harsher, or create a sense of energy.
Rough, sketchy lines create a sense of movement and freedom, while smooth, solid lines feel more still and carefully planned.
A line of sight or action might be suggested by the arrangement of figures and objects within a scene. For example, a group of figures all looking or pointing the same way can create an implied line that draws your eye through the work in a particular direction.

, Make note of characteristics like hue (red, green, blue, etc.), value (lightness or darkness), and intensity. Look at overall color schemes, and think about how the colors work together.For example, do the colors clash, or are they harmonious? Does the work use a variety of colors, or is it monochromatic (all shades of blue, for example)?

, “Space” refers to the areas around and between objects in a work. When talking about space, focus on things like depth and perspective, overlapping of objects, and the use of empty space versus space crowded with details.If you are describing a two-dimensional work of art, like a painting, talk about whether or not the work creates the illusion of three-dimensional space and depth.

, Light in a work of art can look warm or cool, bright or dim, natural or artificial. Take a little time to talk about the role of light and shadow in the work.If you’re talking about a two-dimensional work, like a painting, your focus might be on how the artist creates the illusion of light.
For a three-dimensional work, like a sculpture, you could discuss how actual light interacts with the work. For example, is the surface reflective? Does the sculpture cast interesting shadows? Are some parts of the sculpture more shadowed or well-lit than others?

, Are the shapes in the work geometric, with straight lines and perfect curves, or are they more natural? Is the work dominated by any one particular type of shape, or do you see a variety of different shapes?Shapes play an important role in both abstract and representative works. For instance, in a portrait of a bride by James Sant, there are notable triangle shapes made by the drape of the bride’s veil around her shoulders and the clasped hands in front of her chest.
Once you notice one shape in a painting, look to see if it is repeated anywhere else.

, Once you have described the work, it’s time to analyze it, or discuss how it all comes together. Start by talking about how the work is composed, keeping a few basic ideas in mind. For example:Balance: How do the colors, shapes, and textures in the piece work together? Do they create a balanced or harmonious effect, or is the piece imbalanced in some way?
Contrast: Does the work make use of contrasting colors, textures, or lighting? Contrast can also be found in the use of different shapes or contours, like jagged versus curved lines, or geometric versus natural shapes.
Movement: How does the work create a sense of movement? Is your eye drawn through the composition in a particular way?
Proportion: Do the sizes of the different elements in the work appear the way you would expect, or are they surprising? For example, if the work shows a group of people, do any of the figures look larger or smaller than they would in real life?

, Most works of art have one or more points that are designed catch your attention and draw your eye. In a portrait, this may be the face or eyes of the subject. In a still-life, it could be a centrally-placed or well-lit object. Try to identify which parts of the work are emphasized.Look at the work and make note of which feature(s) jump out at you right away, or keep drawing your eye back to them.
Ask yourself why your eye is attracted to the feature(s) in question. For example, if you find yourself fixating on one figure in a group, is it because that figure is larger than the others? Are they closer to the viewer? More brightly lit?

, Identify a few key themes, and discuss how the artist used the elements of design (color, light, space, shape, and line) to express these themes. Themes might include things like:The use of a color scheme to give the work a particular mood or meaning. See, for example, the paintings of Picasso’s Blue Period.Symbolism and religious or mythological imagery. For example, look at the use of figures and symbols from classical mythology in Renaissance works like Botticelli’s “Birth of Venus.”Repeating images or motifs within a work or group of works. For a good example of this, look at how plants and flowers are used in many of the paintings of Frida Kahlo., In other words, what do you think the artist was trying to say with the work? Why did they create the work? Try to summarize the overall meaning of the work, as you see it., Now it’s time to get a little more subjective. Think about how you feel while looking at the work. What do you think is the overall mood of the work? Does it remind you of anything (ideas, experiences, other works of art)?Use expressive language to talk about your reaction to the work. For example, is the mood of the work sad? Hopeful? Peaceful? Would you describe the work as beautiful, or ugly?

, Use examples from your description and analysis of the work to explain why you think and feel the way you do about the piece.For example, “I believe that James Sant’s portrait of a young bride is intended to give a sense of the bride’s spiritual devotion. This is indicated by the line of the composition, which draws the viewer’s eye upward, following the upward gaze of the subject. It is also suggested by warm light, coming from a source somewhere above the young woman.”

, Your goal here isn’t necessarily to decide whether the art is “good” or “bad.” Instead, focus on whether you think the work is “successful.” For example, think about the following:Do you think the work says what the artist wanted it to say?
Did the artist use their tools and techniques well?
Is the art original, or does it imitate other works?

, Once you have decided on a few aspects of the work to judge, clearly state the focus of your evaluation. For example, you might say that you are judging the piece on how well organized it is, how well done it is technically, and how successfully it portrays the intended mood or themes., In a few sentences, explain your judgment of the work. Give specific reasons for your judgment, using your interpretation and analysis of the work.For example, “I believe this work is successful because the use of light, shape, gesture, and line all work together harmoniously to portray the mood of the subject.”

Read the literature carefully.,
Create a graphic organizer.,
Think about the literal meaning.,
Think about what the author might be suggesting about society or humanity.,
Form a thesis statement.,
Locate evidence in the literature to support your thesis.,
Make an outline.,
Write the essay.,
Revise the essay.",How to Critique Literature1," You start a critique not when you sit down to write the essay, but when you sit down to read the work of literature. Ask yourself why the characters do the things they do in all works of literature, whether novels, short stories, essays, or poems.;
, To help you organize the plot and characters so that you can think about the text, it is useful to make a graphic organizer. There are many ways to set up a chart so that you can organize your observations, including an idea web, Venn diagram, T-chart, and more.For example, for a T-chart, list the names of the characters in one column and their actions in another as you read. After reading, you can add a column with why you think they did each action.

, After you are done reading a piece of literature, think about what each character did and how each action contributed to the plot. Look at your graphic organizer to help you understand what happened in the book. Don’t try to decide what that author is saying at this point. Just look at the actions and plot at face value.


This is similar to artwork. Instead of looking at a painting to figure out what the artist was communicating, just look at what is literally present in the painting. For example, what items are present in Van Gogh’s ‘’Starry Night’’? Don’t think about what he is trying to say in this painting; think about the stars, the swirling night sky, and the houses below.

, After you have a good understanding of the events of the book, you can try to understand what the author was suggesting about human nature through the characters and their actions. These things are called the themes.


For example, ask yourself, why does the witch turn the prince into a beast in Beauty and the Beast? What does this action suggest about human nature?
Also think about what lesson the reader can learn from the characters. What does the Beast teach us?

, After you have selected one lesson the reader can learn from the work of literature, it is time to make a thesis statement out of it. A thesis statement is a single sentence that makes a claim about the piece of literature that can be supported using textual evidence, such as quotes from the piece of literature.The format for a thesis may look something like this: _______ is true because __________, ____________, and ___________.The first blank is your opinion. For example, The Beast teaches us that we should be hospitable to everyone.
The rest of the blanks tell why your opinion is true: The Beast teaches us that we should be hospitable to everyone because he learns from his mistake, becomes a compassionate person through his time as a beast, and regrets that he was ever rude to the witch.
However, keep in mind that there are many different ways to form a thesis. What is most important if to make sure that your thesis includes a claim and a summary of the reasons for your claim. For example, you might phrase your thesis as “Because the Beast suffers for his actions, Beauty and the Beast argues that we should be hospitable to everyone and this theme carries through the story.”

, Look again at your graphic organizer and look for events that demonstrate all of the reasons your thesis is true. Highlight these events and make sure you have the page numbers.


You can summarize these events, or use direct quotes from the book, but both need to have a page number. This prevents plagiarism.
For example, you might use a quote that shows how the Beast is inhospitable as one of your first examples. Then, you might use other examples from the text to show the continuation of this theme.
You do not have to use direct quotes all of the time. You can also paraphrase a passage by putting it into your own words, or summarize longer passages by describing the events in a less detailed way in your own words. No matter if you are quoting, paraphrasing, or summarizing, make sure that you include a page number for your evidence.

, Make an outline using your thesis statement in order to prepare an organized essay. An outline should have roman numerals for each paragraph and regular numbers for the parts of each paragraph. Look up an example of a good outline to guide you.Fill in the outline with topic sentences and events from the literature that support each topic sentence.

, Writing the essay should not be difficult if you have a detailed outline prepared. Write at least five paragraphs. The thesis statement comes at the end of the first paragraph, and each body paragraph has one or two quotes or examples from the text. Make sure to introduce each quote and then explain the quote or example after you put it in the body paragraphs.


Close the essay with a conclusion paragraph, where you summarize the essay in just a few sentences.

, Be sure to proofread and edit your essay. Look for typos, punctuation errors, and grammar errors. You should correct these mistakes (called revising) before turning in the essay. It is helpful to have someone else read the essay to help you find these errors.

Research Production Companies that produce similar shows within the same genre as yours.,
Use TV Industry Websites that Producers use for scouting new TV show ideas and formats.,
When pitching Producers in person, be very direct by immediately communicating the unique agenda of the show.,
When a Production Company is interested, they will propose an ""Option Agreement"" to you, for your project.,
Be sure to consult with an Attorney before signing any deal.",How to Create and Pitch an Idea for a Reality TV Show," This may be a ""Docu-Style"" series that shows viewers a unique world, family, lifestyle or business. Or it may be a competition series with a structured format, leading to an ultimate winner or specific result.;
, This will be the unique premise and agenda that fuels the events in the series, and the ultimate result that we witness.

, A title should be clever, clear, have impact, and tell us what we're essentially watching.

,, This may involve the elimination of contestants based on competition or choices by judges or other person, or it may involve points or votes awarded that lead to a single winner each episode or at season end.

,, This provides third party proof that you created this specific and unique expression of a TV format at a specific date and time.

, Never send your pitch unsolicited, but DO send a direct query requesting permission to submit your reality show pitch for their consideration.

, Production Companies scouting online at websites like the TV Writers Vault are required to agree to a ""Non Disclosure"" agreement, and are tracked electronically by the database as they access materials, reading your TV show pitch. Although most companies do not take unsolicited pitches, it is still critical that you make efforts to find direct connections to Development Executives and Producers at Production Companies. Some will take a pitch submission, and most will require you to sign a ""Material Release Form"" which acknowledges their role within the creative TV Industry and the fact that they may already be working on a similar or identical project, and therefore have the right to Produce such.

, Follow that with specific descriptions of what we're potentially seeing unfold in the show. But don't get bogged down in too much detail. You want to give the powerful highlights in very efficient beats. This may include the specific challenges, or ultimatums and contestants or subjects face.

, This is gives the production company exclusive rights, for a limited time period (typically 12 months) to sell your TV show idea to a Network.

, A standard producing deal for a TV show idea created, should include an on-screen ""Created by"" credit, some form of Producing credit, a Per Episode Fee (usually a percentage of the show's per episode budget), and small percentage of the production company's profits.

Read the work of literature critically.,
Evaluate as you read.,
Brainstorm which aspect to write about.,
Formulate a thesis statement.,
Create an outline.,
Select quotes and patterns that support your thesis.,
Find other criticism to support your thesis.,
Use the outline to write your paper.,
Pay attention to assignment and style guidelines.,
Discuss your quotes.,
Revise your critique.",How to Critique Literature2," When you read a work of literature with the purpose of critiquing it, whether a poem, short story, nonfiction essay, or memoir, you must read it with an active mind. This means that you should ask questions as you read.You should read with a pen and paper handy, as well as with a dictionary. Write down the main ideas in the margins and look up words as you go.
Ask “how,” “why,” and “so what” questions to help you read critically.

, Aside from noting when important ideas occur in the margins of the text, you should write down important ideas and themes on a piece of paper as you read, noting the page numbers. You should also think about the text in terms of critical thinking, such as evaluating the work’s clarity, accuracy, and current relevance to society.Evaluate elements of the work as you go, such as plot, themes, instances of character development, setting, symbols, conflicts, and point of view.Think about how these elements interact to form the main theme.

, Before you settle on a thesis statement—in fact, to formulate a thesis statement in the first place—you should brainstorm what aspect of the work you want to write about. Look at your notes from while you were reading and see if there are any ideas that you have already extracted from the piece, and place these ideas in your brainstorming. You may want to choose a theme from the work that particularly struck you and critique how well the author presented this theme through the elements you evaluated in your notes. There are many ways to brainstorm, including:making a list,
mapping out a web, and
freewriting.
For example, while reading Pride and Prejudice, you might feel that Mr. Darcy’s character needed more development than Jane Austen gave him, or you might prefer Jane’s character to Lizzy’s and feel that she would have made a better heroine (for example, Jane shares a name with the author, giving you grounds to explore the argument that Austen might have actually preferred her). Make a list, web, or freewrite out of ideas like these.

, Once you have populated a brainstorming list and selected a critical perspective (whether based on your own observation or on a critical theory), you should compose a working thesis statement. A “working” thesis is one that can be changed and adapted to your writing as you compose the essay.


The thesis should present your opinion in an arguable manner accompanied by a solid reason why your opinion is true.
The formula for a basic thesis statement might look like this: _______ is true because of __________, ____________, and ___________., You should always use an outline as it requires you to organize your thinking in a logical manner so that your critique is sound and credible. An outline will include elements like your thesis statement, the content of your body paragraphs, and quotes and examples with page numbers. It makes writing the actual essay much easier because all of your research is compiled in one place.You can also take advantage of an outline to form key sentences like the hook (first line of the intro paragraph), topic and transition sentences for each body paragraph, and your conclusion.

, While you are creating the outline, you can start to pick out direct quotes and examples from the text itself (the primary source) and any research you have done (secondary sources). If you place a topic sentence in each body paragraph, you can add the right quotes to support each idea.


Look at your notes and identify any patterns you see in the text that support your thesis statement, such as how no one is ever sure what Mr. Darcy is doing until after the fact, contributing to a lack of character development in Pride and Prejudice (if you were trying to prove the validity of an argument that Mr. Darcy is not developed enough, for example).
You must include a page number or authorial attribution anytime that you: talk about a specific event; paraphrase a quote; paraphrase a passage; or use any direct quote. You usually insert a page number in parentheses after the sentence.

, In order to write a strong critique, you need outside sources to agree with you. This boosts the credibility of your argument and shows that you have the strength of mind to think critically about what you read. Outside sources are also called secondary sources, and you need to make sure they are reliable, such as peer reviewed literary journal or magazine articles, published books, and chapters from books.


You should also address any criticism that does not agree with your thesis, as refuting the counterargument also builds your credibility.

, Once you have gathered your research, formed a thesis statement, and filled in a detailed outline, it is time to write the critique. At this point, you will have plenty of information, and all the organization has been done already, so writing the piece should go smoothly.


If you created your outline on a word processor, then you can simply fill in the outline with additional information.
You can also treat the outline as a roadmap. Consult it as you draft your paper to make sure that you are including all of the points and examples that you have identified.

, Make sure that you follow your instructor’s guidelines for the assignment. For example, you may have specific questions that you need to answer in your paper. You might also have a page length or word count requirement that you need to meet. You will also need to use the correct style to format your paper, such as MLA, APA, or Chicago.


MLA is more common for literary-based essays, but you should ask your instructor if you are not sure.

, Your paper should include quotes from the primary source (the work of literature itself) and from secondary sources (articles and chapters that help your argument). Make sure you analyze every quote that you include so that you are expressing your own opinion rather than regurgitating someone else’s.


For example, after offering a quote, you might explain what the quote means or demonstrates as well as how it supports your thesis. Do not simply paraphrase or summarize the quotes after you offer them. Summary does not show critical thinking. Instead, try to explain the significance of each quote or example to your readers.
Try to create quote sandwiches. A quote sandwich is simply how you position a quote in an essay. You should have a sentence introducing the quote and its author, then have the quote itself, followed by one or more sentences analyzing the quote right after it.Make sure you include a references/works cited list with all sources you quote from or paraphrase in the essay. This prevents plagiarism.

, Proofreading, editing, and revision are all important parts of the writing process and should be done before turning in or publishing a critique of literature. When doing the revision, it is helpful to have someone else look over the essay or read it out loud yourself to find careless mistakes, awkward phrasing, and weak organization.

Look up the author and cultural context.,
Highlight and look up words and passages you don’t understand.,
Investigate the meaning of the title.,
Decide on the central theme.,
Examine components of the work.,
Form an interpretation of the work.",How to Critique Literature3," If you are reading a piece of literature with the purpose of critiquing it internally rather than for an essay, you should begin with understanding the cultural milieu of the piece. Knowing the social context of a written work boosts your understanding of the vocabulary, setting, and character motivations, all of which are critical for forming an accurate critique.

, Bring a highlighter or pen with you to your reading sessions, and mark words you don’t understand. Looking them up in a dictionary as you read will increase your understanding of the text, just as knowing the cultural milieu in which the text was written does.

, Once you begin reading, consider the significance of the title. Ask yourself why the author chose this title. Is it a simple title, merely relating the main setting or object, such as the title of the short story “The Yellow Wallpaper”? If so, why would the author understate the work so much?


Questioning the title helps in determining the main theme and contributes to a more accurate critique.

, Thinking about the title will help you determine the main theme of the work. Determining the main theme provides a trunk from which the branches of the rest of your examination of the text will spring. You will look at the elements of literature of this text, and knowing what theme they should be pointing to helps you to critique how well the author accomplishes this.

, Examine the elements of the piece of literature you’re reading by exploring how each element is presented in the text. Identify examples of each element and determine how each relates to the main theme. You may want to write down where these connections take place in order to organize your thoughts.Setting—description of the surroundings.
Plot—events of the text.
Characters—the motivations and depth of each character, such as how much they change or don’t change as a result of the events. Characters can be people, objects, even ideas (especially in poetry).
Conflict—the opposition that the main character encounters and its climax and resolution.
Themes—what the narrator observes about human nature.
Point of view—the way that a character thinks, whether it is curious, condescending, etc. Can also be the perspective the text is told, whether in first person, third person, etc.
Tone—the way the text feels, whether sad, happy, angry, apathetic, etc.
Symbols—objects, people, or places that repeat consistently throughout the story and seem to represent another abstract idea.

, Once you have analyzed the different elements of the text, you may form an interpretation based on your analyses. This interpretation could be that the author could have done a better job, that the author is profound, that some elements of the text connect to modern society in an interesting way, etc.


You may want to write down your interpretation of the work at this point, as it is an excellent springboard into a thesis statement, if you end up needing to write a paper about this text.
You can review outside sources such as peer reviewed articles and books to verify that your interpretation is accurate or needs work.

Follow standard formatting guidelines.,
Write catchy character descriptions, in a voice or tone that is reflective of the script's style and mood.,
Include fonts and graphics as appropriate.,
Close the cast list off with a short summation of the play's setting(s) and details of the intermission (or lack thereof).",How to Design a Creative Cast Page," There are certain specifications for your page design that should not be altered:


Use standard margins, 1 inch (2.54 cm) in from the edges, and 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) hanging indents if any of the character descriptions take up more than 1 line.
Do not include a page number on your creative cast page.
Set the names of the cast members apart from the rest of the text by capitalizing them or using a bold font.;
, Next to the character's name, be sure to include the following information:


Identifying information. This includes, but is not limited to: age, race, physical description and gender.
A short write-up of the character's personal back-story. Try to provide a sense of who that character is as a person, what the character's defining personality traits are, etc.
Multiple casting designations. Indicate if a character on the cast list is meant to play more than 1 character in the play.

,


Animated graphics portraying head shots of the cast members is a good way to customize the cast page. These graphics should be placed right next to each coinciding character description.
Draw attention to names on the cast list by enlarging or bolding the font, or use a different font altogether.
Choose a font for your creative cast page that seems to represent the feel of the play. Just make sure it easy to read.

, Again, stay within the tone of the production itself.

, Study the figurine so you can see the proportions and details. Looking at the map can help you design your own and maybe give you some ideas for names.

, This step is optional, but it may help you. You can write down what page will contain what, what style it'll be drawn in (cartoon,realistic,sketched,etc) and any other notes you want.

, Pick whatever size or style you want. If you can, get one that is decorated with the same thing as your book subject. It should be sturdy and have quality paper so it won't get damaged. Another great thing to get would be a blank book. If it's cover isn't glossed, you can draw on it!

,, Set aside time each day to draw your book. You might decide to do one page a day or an hour a week.

, Photocopy all of the pages in your sketchbook (and number them too!). Contact a publishing agency looking for picture/art/etc books. If they want to see your book, then you can mail it.

Purchase DVD videos at retail stores such as Best Buy or Walmart.
Use online sources like the aforementioned brands' websites, or at Amazon.com in order to purchase DVD videos.
Hit up your local video store and see what previously-released videos they have for sale. Purchasing a previously-watched copy can generally come at a greater cost savings than purchasing the video new from a traditional retailer.
Watch garage sales for even more videos to add to your collection. With the move to electronic file and Blu-ray players, many families are selling their old DVDs for a fraction of what you would pay had you purchased them from a retailer.;
, This video format is newer than DVD, generally comes in high definition, and it is being heralded as the successor of the DVD format. Because of their large storage capacity, these discs generally have a larger number of additional features than a DVD video disc.


You can purchase Blu-ray videos at both in-store locations and online just like a DVD video. Another online source for Blu-Ray discs, though, is through the actual Blu-ray website at http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/.

, This will allow you to filter specific categories and events related to what is planned in the future., Search and browse around from sports games to rock concerts or family friendly events. If you know of a future event but Ticketmaster does not show it in the search, please know that tickets are not going to be available until a later date. If the option ""Find Tickets"" is enabled, it means that tickets are on sale.

, This informs the public of the on-sale dates and times (including any exclusive pre-sale dates/times), price ranges for all tickets, and extra details concerning the specific event (such as ticket limits per household, etc).

, This can not be expressed enough. Even if it's in the same arena/venue, the seating charts will not be the same as another show/event (for example, concert vs. basketball game). You need to know how close or how far you will be away from the main entertainment or stage, as well as different levels (if applicable), as there is a clear difference between a floor seat and balcony seat (bleeder or near the ceiling).


Lots of venue websites, especially the ones located in metropolitan cities, have their own seating chart for different events.

, If you're a beginner to Ticketmaster or want the site to choose for you for flexibility, then choosing ""Best Price"" is preferable. Also, for events that are in demand or very popular, you might want to go through that route instead of trying to get the best seats. Click on the red ""Find Tickets"".

, This is a tool to discourage bots from using the website in order to gain tickets in a non-human method.

, It might look like a lot, thus why it's very important to look at the seating chart. This will give you a preview of what specific seat you are paying for, the specific price for it, etc. You need to know that every ticket reviewed as a ""timer"" in the bottom right hand corner. This is the amount of time you have to make a decision if you want the seat(s) or change your mind. You can either ""Continue"" on to purchase it if you're satisfied or ""Search Again"". Searching again will then bring you back to the main ticket page for the event and place your old review back into the queue for anyone else to grab.


Know that when the general public is allowed to purchase tickets and depending on the demand/popularity of the event, you may/may not receive a better ticket than the last, so be careful how much time you spend on each ticket review.

, You'll need to enter your credit card information or how you will be paying for the tickets. Having an account has it's perks, as you wouldn't need to worry about inputting information every time. This page also has it's own unique timer, so please be sure that you have everything in front of you beforehand., Shipping methods look exactly like as if you're purchasing any other item online. Depending on where you live, you might find ground shipping to be the most efficient. If the event date is closer than a month or you wish to have the tickets immediately, choose the option of printing your tickets out or picking them up at the local box office. When printing tickets out, they will be an actual ticket, just on a 8""x11"" paper instead of regular ticket stubs - remember to bring the entire paper with you to the event!"

Develop a strong personal style.,
Be prolific.,
Publish your work.,

Find a reliable art agent.,
Paint what you care about.,
Keep growing as an artist.",How to Become a Famous Artist," Being called by the muse is a wonderful thing, without a doubt, but without the technical abilities to realize your vision, you won't get very far. Whatever your chosen medium or media, become an expert in every part of it.


Set aside an hour or more each day to devote to nothing but practicing your technique.
Focus especially on those areas that are the weakest for you, but build your strengths as well.
Take advantage of the communities and resources that you can find. Artist supply manufacturers, and art stores themselves, often have free literature, tutorials, videos, and websites that are loaded with tips, techniques, and more.
Some stores even offer weekend training seminars, where you can not only pick up some new skills, you'll also meet other artists.;
, Choose one subject that is meaningful to you and that you want to be able to draw well.


Start with a still life, or a photo that's yours, in public domain, or that you have permission to use. Draw or paint that same photo over and over, using different approaches—paint, pencil, abstract, realism—whatever moves you.
Build up from easy subjects, like a rubber ball or a rectangular block, to more complicated, difficult subject, like a rose, a clear glass marble or a shiny metal bowl. And try to get the details right: the curves of a petal, the clarity of the glass, or reflections so good that Escher would be impressed! Each of them will improve your ability to draw in general.
Practice timed gesture drawing. Pick your subject, set your timer for two or three minutes, start drawing, then stop when the timer goes off, even if the drawing isn't finished.
Set the timer again and start over. Doing 10 three minute drawings will give you more skill than taking half an hour to draw the same thing in detail.

, Start off with a pencil, then go to charcoal, colored pencils, pastels, paint, whatever interests you. Never fear trying new tools or techniques.


When trying an expensive new medium, visit Dick Blick or Jerry's Artarama and email them for samples. Many types of art suppliers make sample sized products or the company will send out just one stick or a small piece of the expensive paper or canvas for you to test before deciding what to buy.
This gives you a chance to try it first and see if you like it. Try more than one brand—the samples are usually not the same color and you can find out which brand to invest in by those trials.

, Make it clear you want a real opinion, not just a biased, ""I love you so everything you do is wonderful"" opinion. If they think it's good, then you're on the right track! If they don't, you're still on the right track: if several people think your technique is great, but your subject matter leaves something to be desired, that's an opportunity for self-reflection and to learn something.


Don't confuse critique with personal criticism, especially if the critic is somebody who is not interested in seeing you become an artist.

, Look for critique from people who draw better than you do. Make friends online with real artists whose work you admire. Compliment them and ask intelligent questions about their techniques. You'll rapidly find that many artists enjoy teaching beginners and will be happy to share what they've learned.


As you learn more, reach out to those who are just starting. You will learn more every time you explain and demonstrate what you already know. It's very common for teachers to learn from their students!

, When friends and family members love everything you draw and think it's wonderful, or your mum was putting your childhood scribblings up on the fridge from the time you were two (and believes you'll be Picasso someday), relax and enjoy that as support.


The better you get at art, the easier it is for people to compliment you and call you talented.
Compliments can sometimes be critiques, and those are very valuable! Should an artist whose work you admire give you a compliment such as, ""I love the colors in this,"" this means they are not only nice enough to compliment you on your work, but have taken the time to understand and appreciate the choices you made.

, Do this by learning to paint and draw your favorite subjects in all the ways that every painter you like best has done them. The more you learn technique and understand your own passions, the more your own style will emerge.


Having a personal style is a combination of learning to draw and paint well in your favorite mediums while consistently paying the most attention to your favorite subjects.
You will become a specialist, a ""brand of one"" at a certain intermediate level of competence. Mastering a subject and a medium comes later, at the point when you could do it easily without thinking at all about how you do it, yet always have consistent results.

, To get into a gallery, you should have a portfolio of up to a dozen of your best works, all of which have something in common, be it the subject or style, general size and level of skill.


Make your work available in as many formats as possible, so that there are no barriers for interested gallery owners or art patrons to view your work.

, The best way to become famous is to get known! The internet offers many avenues to be seen and promote artistic works, and in the information-loaded 21st century, it's important to use all the tools at your disposal to build your name and your reputation.


Blog daily about your work, and include illustrations showing your process and a gallery to show (and/or sell) your finished works.
Visit all the galleries in your area, and get to know the proprietors. If you're old enough, attend as many openings as possible, not to promote your own work—there will be time enough for that later—but to become a known artist in the community.
Create a Facebook for your art, and encourage people to visit and like your page. Reach out to other artists through Facebook. Like visiting galleries, this will help place you in the community, and Facebook can reach well beyond your neighborhood.
Tweet about art regularly. Your art, historical art, pop art, any art at all. The more you know about art, the more you'll be recognized as somebody worth paying attention to. At the same time, follow artists and galleries, and respond to their tweets. This will encourage more people—including gallery owners—to follow you.
Create a Flickr account and post scans or photos of your art. It's an active community, and while you won't get a lot of helpful critique on Flickr, you will build your name recognition, and perhaps become online friends with some very talented artists.

, Start with student level contests at first and small local art contests.


Teach workshops. This will help you not only get known as an artist, but also as an expert in your field.
Build your skills until you can enter major national and international contests in your chosen medium.
Enter juried art shows. Getting a painting into a juried art show is itself an achievement to put on your resume. When you have too many, shorten it by listing only the most important shows.

, Read up on art agencies and contact the agent's other clients. See if they are happy with the agent, or are generally discontented or feel as if they've been ripped off. Agents will market you and your work, and also represent you in contract negotiation. Make sure they are well-connected and good with contracts.


You might also want to work with a reputable attorney who specializes in the art world. While an agent may know a bit about the law, their job is promotion. A lawyer's only job is knowing about the applicable law.

, If you don't care about the subject, it will show in your work. Many artists fall a little bit in love with their subject, whether it be a bowl of fruit or the artist's model.


If you like expressing anger and dark emotions, study dark painters. If you like abstracts and splatter paintings, study them and do them—they take their own techniques and don't just happen because someone threw paint at a canvas and called it art.
If you love wildlife and the outdoors, get a small portable painting kit and paint ""en plein air"" (outdoors) in your favorite places.
Whatever your passion, find ways to capture that passion on the canvas.

, Being a true artist is a lifelong pursuit. When you've reached the level of fame to which you aspire, with plenty of money and acclaim, you will still want to look forward to something beyond that.


Continuing to learn and invent, even after you are famous will not just keep you on top of your game, focused on the future instead of putting your best years behind you.
As you style grows and changes, older paintings you've done become more valuable. Collectors will be interested in the entire history of your life's work. Even the drawings you did as a child become valuable: what your mom stuck to the fridge has the seeds of your current success, so don't throw away earlier works.

Listen to podcasts.",How to Be Well Read," Reading the classics is the very first thing you have to do to be well-read. If you want to build a solid foundation for your understanding of the books you read, then you can't avoid some of the earliest plays, poems, and oral tales ever written down. Remember that the novel didn't really get popular until the 18th century, so you won't find novels on this list. Without reading the poetry of Homer or the plays of Sophocles, you won't be able to call yourself well-read. Here's a list to get you started:



The Epic of Gilgamesh (Unknown author) (18th – 17th century BCE)

The Iliad and The Odyssey by Homer (850–750 BCE, 8th century BCE)

, Though a large amount of material is covered in these measly 300 years, reading the books from the time period when the novel emerged until the beginning of World War I will give you a sense of the progress that the novel and other works had made throughout the Romantic and Victorian periods, as well as an understanding of the realism that was the traditional mode for novels which was then turned on its head with the advent of Modernism and the disillusionment that came from WWI. Here's a list to get you started:

Here are the different types of non-fiction that you should familiarize yourself with:


History
Politics
Magazines
Memoirs
Biographies
The news

, If you really want to know what everyone is talking about, then you can't just sit around reading Virgil. You'll have to know what's going on in the modern world too, and to read those beach reads or plane reads or Oprah's book club has been talking about. How do you know what to read? Well, check out what people are reading on planes, beaches, etc, and also check out the New York Times bestseller list to check out which books are on the list.

, How can setting goals make reading more fun, you may ask? Well, because you'll feel good about yourself if you accomplish something, that's why. Start small: say, you want to read one book a month. Then go down to a book every two weeks. When you're officially addicted to reading, you can read one book a week -- or even two. Make a list of books and stick to them and you'll be reading more and more in no time at all.


Setting goals will also keep you from wasting your time in less productive endeavors. Let's say you've aimed to finish Ulysses by the weekend but there's a marathon of Bad Girls Club on. Bye bye bad girls, hello culture.

, The Modern Library, Amazon, Time Magazine, and the New York Times have some great top 100 lists that can make you feel even more accomplished for reading. You'll feel extremely well-read and good about yourself if you find yourself going down a list and crossing off every book you've read. Check out these lists for more reference:


The Modern Library Top 100 Modern Books list.Time Magazine's Best Book of All Time list.The Guardian's Top 100 Books of All Time list.Read books by Nobel-prize winning authors. Check out the list of authors here:The Village Voice's list of best books of the previous decade, by genre., Open an account at Audible.com or start listening to books you've rented from your local library. Listening to audiobooks is a great way to be well-read when you're too tired to pick up a book and read. You can also listen to the books in the car, which is perfect for a long commute, or on your iPod while you're taking a walk. Suddenly you'll be looking forward to that long drive to work instead of dreading it!


Before you buy or rent the book, see if you can listen to a sample to make sure you like the voice of the person who is reading. If you think the person has an annoying voice, the book will feel like a slow read.

, Though a Kindle can cost over $100, you'll quickly save money when you start buying books at the discount rate it offers. You can buy many classic novels, such as the works of Henry James, for under one dollar, and you can get contemporary novels at a 10-25% discount from what you would pay in the store, depending on the book. Getting a Kindle will also allow you to download a book the second you have a reading craving, instead of waiting around for a convenient time to run to the store.


When you have a Kindle, you can also sample a chapter of a book before buying it, so you can still browse the books a bit.

, Though being well-read is important, having fun when you're reading is important too. What's your vice--cheesy detective novels, Harlequin romances, or thrillers? Whatever books you really love to read, don't give 'em up just to read Charles Dickens. Instead, reward yourself: say that for every classic novel or literary novel you read, you'll get to read one thriller, one beach romance, or one book of whatever genre you love the most.

, Being part of a book club will not only help you make friends with other well-read people, but it will open you up to a wider variety of books and will give you strict deadlines for finishing the books, as well as some time to think about what the books mean to you. Book clubs will keep you from speeding from one book to the next without stopping to think what it all means.


In most book clubs, you'll have a chance to pick a book for the club to read, so you'll get to share one of your favorite authors with others.

, If you start an account on Goodreads, you'll be able to make a list of all the books you've read or want to read, review the books you've read, and to interact with other book lovers. Starting an account is free and will connect you to even more books and more readers. And more importantly, it'll make you more excited about reading, so start an account today!, Get an account at Amazon if you don't have one already and start reviewing all of those great books you've read. Once you've reviewed a ton of books and have written interesting and thoughtful reviews, you'll be on your way to reaching top reader status. If you do make it to top reader, you'll get perks like discounts, and the ability to read books before their official release date.


And even if you don't become a top reader, taking the time to review the books you've read will help you think about what you've read.

, Just hanging out with people who love to read, whether they're your co-workers or members of your book club, will open you up to more ideas of what books to read next, and will give you a better sense of which books are popular. There's no point in being well-read if you can't use your knowledge to have interesting discussions with other people.

, You can download free podcasts, such as the New Yorker Fiction podcasts, or KCRW's weekly Bookworm podcasts, to hear writers read from their favorite stories or to hear authors discuss their new books. You can also get your news from podcasts, and listen anything from Chekhov's stories to classic speeches in American history, such as the Gettysburg address.

Practice.,
Deconstruct the talents you hope to acquire.,
Practice until you can self-correct.,
Be consistent and persistent.,
Remove distractions during practice.",How to Be Talented in Multiple Areas1," Whatever it is you’re trying to be talented at, you know you have to practice. This is especially true if you hope to be talented in multiple areas. Fortunately, you may not need to practice quite as much as you think, and can likely make the time to practice multiple skills every day. In order to get the most out of the time you put in, you have to focus on what you’re hoping to learn.


Practice two different skills 40-45 minutes each, every day for a month.
Don’t worry if you miss a day of practicing one of your talents once in a while. If you practice each skill almost every day for a month, you’ll have put in about 20 hours of focused practice on improving each of the talents you hope to develop!;
, In order to practice deliberately and efficiently, you need to make sure you are absolutely focused during practice. One way to help maximize the efficiency of your practice time is to deconstruct the talents you hope to improve upon into specific skills.


Ask yourself; What, specifically, do you need to be good at in order to be more talented at whatever ability you’re developing?
Choose specific objectives to achieve each time you sit down to practice something. Repeat a small task or process many, many times until you’ve mastered it.For instance, if you’re trying to improve your ability to play a sport, choose an extremely basic aspect of playing that sport and spend 45 minutes straight on just that specific aspect.

For example, if you’re hoping to become a better soccer player, dribble a soccer ball back and forth on the field with just one foot.
If you’re hoping to improve your talent as a basketball player, shoot only lay-ups.


Deconstructing your effort to improve one talent will help you improve other talents as well. Following the sports example, doing anything physically active will get you in better shape and improve your coordination, both of which will increase your physical abilities generally.

, Practice enough so that you are able to both notice and correct errors in your execution of a particular ability. (Once you’ve completed a disciplined practice routine, during which you practice almost daily for a month, you will likely reach this point.)


Moving forward, your practice will become more efficient. This is because you have gained a solid base of knowledge from which your talent will more naturally progress.
For instance, if you’re hoping to improve your ability to play an instrument, practice playing the same single notes or chord so frequently than you automatically know exactly what you did wrong when the sound is even a little bit off.

, Dabbling and practicing are different things. Jogging or painting twice a week are fun and healthy things to do, but in order to acquire talent, you need to be more disciplined in your pursuit of improvement. Something that may help you be persistent is choosing two very different talents to practice and improve upon during the same time period.


Get in the groove of practicing at the same time of day each day.
Try practicing skills related to two talents you’re hoping to improve upon back-to-back. Get in the habit of practicing one talent then immediately practicing the other.
For example, right when you get home from a daily run, sit down to paint. Grouping your practice sessions together will encourage you to do both consistently.
Work on two widely different talents to increase the variety of your daily activities. Following the example used in this step, doing something active like running pairs well with something creative and contemplative, like painting.

, Do not rely entirely on willpower to focus adequately during practice time. Here are a few tips to ensure your practice time is free of interruption:


Set aside a block of time devoted exclusively to practice and commit to practicing for that full length of time. Set a timer if you’d like.
Turn your phone on silent.
Make sure there are no screens running in your vicinity (unless you’re using them to help you practice).
If you have music playing, consider choosing something without lyrics.

, Whether you build the backdrop, design an entire set, or work as a prop master, the experience will help you build invaluable skills for your career.

, Take photographs of sets you designed, and if you have clippings with favorable reviews of any production you worked on, add them. If you have any film work, create a reel with clips.

, Of course, this is easier said than done, but learning from somebody who is highly experienced and skilled will enhance the quality of your work. Send out cover letters and resumes, along with your portfolio, to art directors in your area and ask if he or she needs an intern or an apprentice. Don't expect to be paid for any of this work, so you'll need another source of income to support yourself.

, Try to always be working on a project, even if it's an amateur production, an internship, or a low-budget film.

, Approach production companies, directors, and studio execs by email or mail with your cover letter, resume and portfolio. Reply to classifieds on Mandy.com and other film production job boards.

Start with a bang.,
Have fun onstage.,
Don’t call attention to your mistakes.,
End your show in a memorable way.",How to Be a Good Entertainer1," Audiences tend to be both impatient and judgmental, so you want to capture their attention as soon as possible and hold it for as long as you can. Structure your performance so it begins with something memorable or impressive to break the ice and engage the crowd.If you’re a stand up, start with a joke about your appearance or something else your audience might notice when they first look at you.
If you’re a musician, lead off with a high energy number, as opposed to a ballad.
Start off confident, but make sure to save your best trick for the end of the performance.;
, The reason people go see performers is to be entertained. It’s not entertaining to see a performer going through the motions – audiences want to see performers living out their dreams and leaving it all on the stage.If you come offstage and you’re not exhausted, then you still had more to give.
Smile! Try putting Vaseline on your teeth to keep your teeth from sticking to your lips.
The more comfortable you get with your performance or routine, the easier it will be for you to have fun.
Improvise something new every time you perform - this will keep your performance from feeling stale.
Don’t bottle your enjoyment up inside – let it out and share it with your audience. They want to live vicariously through you.

, Mistakes happen in life and in art. How entertainers deal with mistakes can separate the artists from the amateurs. If you mess up, don’t worry about it and don’t telegraph your mistake to the audience.If you a make a mistake, move on. The audience probably won’t even notice if you don’t call it out.
Know that the audience is rooting for you to succeed. If you fall or mess up, they want to see you overcome and move forward.

, The end of your show is the last thing your audience will remember, so it's important to end your performance with a bang. If you plan on having an encore, make sure you prepare for it ahead of time.Leave your audience wanting more. Look at your set list and edit one to two things out.
Know when it’s time to wrap up – sometimes it’s better to end the show early than to prolong something that people clearly aren’t enjoying.
If your venue has a curfew, be respectful of that. Be cognizant of time and don't run over.

Defy negative thoughts.,
Strengthen your position with positive thinking.,
Practice the thinking part too.",How to Be Talented in Multiple Areas2," In order to maintain talent in multiple areas, train yourself to prevent negative thoughts that can diminish your ability to work towards achieving the multiple goals you set for yourself. There are several ways to rid your mind of negative thinking:Overcome fear. Audacious, yes. But reflect on what’s holding you back. The most common barriers to acquiring talent are based on your emotions.Recognize this and prevent emotional perspectives, such as fear, from preventing you from pursuing whatever talent you wish to acquire.
Filter out the negative. We tend to filter out the positive and be overly concerned with the negative, especially in terms of our perspective on our own abilities. Don’t fall for this mental trap. Contemplate your room for improvement only insofar as it motivates you to continue improving.
Recognize the middle ground. Abandon the concept of perfection. Don’t think that you must be perfect at something to consider yourself talented.

, Optimism isn’t going to make you good at anything on its own, but it will help. Recognize that it is objectively within your control to decide how to think about something, especially goals you set for yourself and your ability to accomplish them.


Respond to negative thoughts that arise by re-framing them in equally true, but more positive perspectives. For instance:Instead of thinking, “I’ve never done this before, and it seems hard,” think, “Here’s an opportunity to learn, and there are a few different ways to approach this.”
Instead of thinking, “I’m too lazy” or “There’s no way I can do that,” tell yourself, “I haven’t put enough time into this, but I can at least try it and see how it goes.”
Finally, don’t get discouraged by thoughts about how slowly your talents are improving. Decide to tell yourself that it’s worth one more try.



, Even convincing yourself to favor positive thinking takes practice. It will pay off though. Become less critical of the world around you, and of yourself, simply by repeating positive sentiments to yourself and pushing away negative thoughts.


Maintaining a positive mindset will not only improve your mood, but will help motivate you to stick with the hard work required to acquire new talents."
"
Monitor your progress.,
Rest.,
Accept that innate skill is less significant than practice and perseverance.,
Improve upon talents that interest you.,
Read.",How to Be Talented in Multiple Areas3," Know that focused practice will not always be fun. Realizing the development of your talents, however, will be. Take note of and appreciate your achievements – such as a new personal record mile time or a particularly compelling painting.


If there are tangible indications of your progress (perhaps especially paintings), place them in locations you will frequently see them in order to motivate yourself to continue practicing and improving upon your talents!

, Keep your mind and body ready to practice with focus and energy. More to the point, rest strategically. If the talent you’re trying to improve requires intense physical activity or mental focus, you’re going to have to keep your mind and body conditioned enough to practice effectively.This may actually require that you do take off one day a week. This is important to do if it improves your ability to practice effectively for the rest of the week.

, Even the abilities some people seem to be born with come more from training than from inborn talent.This is true for athletes, musicians, and mathematicians!


Know you’ll need some grit. Psychologists have come to use the term “grit” when referring to an attribute held by successful people. Grit indicates both perseverance and passion in pursuing long-term goals.Overcoming adversity in pursuit of developing your skills also positively contributes to improve your talents more generally. When facing challenges that others might not have to deal with, tell yourself that by overcoming them, you’ll have a step up on everyone else.

, Even scientists aren’t sure about how to increase talent. The question of how we become good at things is still largely unanswered. We do know that people who are exposed to things that they become drawn to naturally and who then become immersed in those things end up being good at them. With training and practice, people who are already into something become especially good at it. Accept the significance of these findings and act accordingly:Observe and play without inhibition. Inspiration and curiosity will inevitably hit you and you’ll end up pursuing talents you’ll be interested in enough to stick with.
Ignore the technical aspects of the talent you’re hoping to acquire. You can bring in the technical aspects of perfecting your abilities once you’re committed.
Don’t try to judge where your interests are coming from.
Avoiding these tendencies will allow your more creative and emotional aspirations to get you hooked on something.

, Reading is a great place to start learning about how you can become more talented in multiple ways. One of the main benefits here is perking your curiosity and motivating yourself to pursue new ways to expand your talents, or to pursue new talents altogether.


Becoming interested in something you’ve read is seen as an indication that you may take especially well to the material.If you become interested in something new, throw yourself at it.
There are literal advantages to reading too: you learn about language and writing, about whatever era of history is relevant to the book, and, of course, about the content contained in the book. You’re immediately more knowledgeable about all sorts of stuff, just by dragging your eyes back and forth across a page and interpreting a bunch of printed words!
Of course, nothing compares to hands-on experience. Whatever you read about that appeals to you, practice doing it yourself and develop a new talent!

Connect with your audience.,
Make your audience feel comfortable.,
Engage your audience.,
Read your audience.",How to Be a Good Entertainer2," A big part of performing is sharing a piece of who you are with your audience. It’s not enough to just perform for them – you also need to engage them emotionally.The more personal you can make your performance, the more your audience will respond to it.
If you’re a musician, tell stories about your life between songs.
If you’re a stand up, do some crowd work and interact with the audience between jokes.
If you’re a dancer, don’t forget to look out and make eye contact with your audience as you perform.

, There’s nothing more unnerving than watching a performer flounder on stage. When you’re performing, you’re responsible for your audience’s happiness, so make sure to show up well-prepared and ready to work.Don’t allow nerves to affect your performance – turn that nervous energy into a more productive performance energy.
Block out and rehearse every portion of your performance so there are no surprises for you or your audience.

, Get your audience involved in your performance. Giving them something to do will help them feel like an integral part of the experience. Get them in on the action by asking questions or including them in your jokes or tricks.If you’re a magician, have at least one trick that requires an audience volunteer.
Make sure to choose a volunteer that actually wants to participate – they won’t have fun if they just want to get off the stage.
If you’re a musician, perform a popular song and let the audience sing along for a verse.

, As you begin to perform more, you’ll learn that not every audience reacts to your performance the same way. A small, intimate performance in a café is very different from a large concert venue and as a performer, you need to be able to read your audience and give them the kind of performance they want.If your audience isn’t enjoying the jokes or music you’re performing, be able to adapt on the fly and switch to something that might be more their speed.
Know that you’ll have to be bigger, louder and more energetic the larger the venue and the more people you have watching.

Highlight your strengths and work on your weaknesses.,
Practice in front of a mirror.,
Only compete with yourself.,
Be grateful.",How to Be a Good Entertainer3," Self-talk is the internal dialogue that all humans have inside their heads. The more negative your self-talk is, the more it will negatively affect your confidence levels.Keep a self-talk log where you write down all the negative thoughts that come to mind when you’re practicing.
Rewrite your negative thoughts to be more positive. So “there’s no use in practicing, I’ll never become successful” turns into “successful people have to work hard and if I work hard, some day I’ll be successful too.”

, All performers have something they’re good at – that’s why people want to watch them. But all performers also have weak spots, and those are the muscles you really need to stretch.Take a class and work with your instructor to improve on your weaknesses.
Find a fellow performer who is really good at what you’re bad at and ask them for advice.
When rehearsing, don’t practice what you already do well – focus your session on the areas that need improvement and run those parts ad nauseam.

, Regardless of what kind of performer you are, it’s imperative that you see the way you are presenting yourself to an audience. Look at the way you carry yourself, the way you move your body. Practice what you’ll say to introduce a new song or joke.Set up a camera during your practice session and record yourself performing.
Be critical when watching it back and look for ways you can elevate your performance.
Practice each performance fifty times all the way through before stepping out on stage., Art and performance are completely subjective, so placing yourself in direct competition with someone is else is reductive. Instead of focusing on who else might be performing, focus on how you can make your performance the best you’ve ever done.Think of the best performance you’ve ever had, then try to top that.
Instead of thinking about what you don’t want to mess up, think of what you want to accomplish.

, Getting to perform for a living or to perform at all is a luxury. Regardless of how you feel about your craft on any given day, remind yourself that you love performing. This love and passion will shine through your performance and automatically make you a more engaging performer.


Remind yourself why you love performing every time you step out on stage.
If you’re having trouble tapping into gratitude, take a break from performing. You’ll be surprised at how much you miss it.

Prepare in advance.,
Dress up beautifully or elegantly.,
Try costume spotting.,
Decide which of the performers might be good in non-singing roles.,
Space out.,
Try to get into the spirit of it.,
Take notice.,
Make excuses if the performance is extremely long.,
Afterwards,find polite ways of avoiding deep conversation about the opera and any hint that you hated it.,
Be prepared to enjoy it.",How to Sit Through Opera," Taking along a few things to keep you occupied can be a helpful way of coping. Here are some suggestions:


Take small candies or chewing gum to quietly chew or suck on. Somehow, having something sweet in your mouth helps to cope with a sour experience. Make sure they're unwrapped (and therefore not noisy) before you leave for the theatre.
Have plenty of tissues or handkerchiefs to catch sneezes and coughs. These can be very loud during an opera, and people will turn and look at you if you don't manage to muffle the noise quickly.
Stash a small notebook and pen in your bag. Perhaps you can write down some thoughts to help pass the time. If you like sketching, consider drawing audience members or the singers.
Before the big evening, ask your friend what language the opera is in and bring along a mini dictionary in that language. You can play ""spot the word meaning"" to while away some time.
Sneak in an MP3 player. Get dark-coloured earplugs so they're harder to spot. If your friend discovers this though, you'll be in the doghouse.;
, At least going to the opera gives you a grand opportunity to look your very best, to the point of going over-the-top! Strut your evening wear in the intervals and appear as graceful and erudite as you can.

, The costumes at operas are often incredibly opulent. Spend some time appreciating the costumes, particularly the fabrics that were used. See how realistic the costumes appear, and think about whether there are some especially gorgeous ones that inspire you with fashion ideas for your own clothes.


You can do the same kind of analysis with the scenery. Think about the work that went into making the sets and what creative ways are being used to move scenery around and make it work effectively. Think about the composer. It can be amusing to try figuring out what the composer was thinking when he or she wrote the opera. The program may offer some hints, and it might even be possible to build an entire picture of the composer's frame of mind at the time, whether they had personal issues that fed the storyline, and what lesson or moral they were trying to pass on to future generations.

, Opera requires extremely good acting as well as singing to get the points across, especially when it involves comedy. See if you can spot any of the singers who would transfer well to acting if they ever had to give up singing.

, Withdraw into your own mind for some mental gymnastics. If you like meditating, take this opportunity to meditate in your seat. It's a chance to think about things that you haven't had time to focus on lately: gift lists for friends and family, solutions for that overflowing in-tray at work, and whether or not you should buy that new pair of what's-its you saw in the store window on the way to the theatre. Or, if you'd rather, think about nothing at all, and use this time for complete mental relaxation – you don't have to understand what you're seeing, you don't have anyone talking to you, and you don't have chores before you, so make the most of it! Right, relax and enjoy.



Stay relaxed and at ease. You'll appear interested in the performance while actually thinking of other things (or perhaps nothing at all!).
Avoid nodding off. That will look bad--worse if you drool--thereby destroying your credibility with your friend.

, Open up the program and read what the opera is about. You might find it intriguing. You could even be curious to see how they set the story to music. At the very least, an understanding of the story will make it easier to follow the opera, and you might end up enjoying the production after all!


In case there is no program explaining the opera, you might make a quick online search to find out the background to the opera before you go, or on your smartphone in the foyer before going in.
Ask your friend about the story behind the opera. Inquire as to what he or she finds so fascinating about opera and try to see their points as the opera unfolds. You might even be so intrigued that it improves your entire experience.
Bear in mind that opera performers train for many years, and those who make it to the stage are the best at their art. Do your best to enter into the spirit of the evening by appreciating the skills on display.

, Half of enjoying an opera is the art of how the singers communicate with the audience. In plays you don't have a guy clump onstage and say ""Yeah, I like that girl"", pointing to a girl who is clearly supposed to be the lead. You see him interact with her, trying to get her attention, or standing and hoping she notices him. Even if you don't understand the language, understanding what's going on is pretty intuitive. In the second act of ""La Traviata"", for example, the guy and the girl are in love and are happily together. When the guy is busy out of the room, however, his father visits and tells the girl ""hey, you're too low-class, and you're gonna ruin the family name if you marry my son. You'd better get out of here."" She proceeds to write a letter to her lover, and it's clear that she's in distress about it. Ironically after she leaves, the father has the gall to stick around and comfort his son who is upset about about the whole thing., Take restroom breaks and have a breather; walk around a little; if you must yawn, do it outside in the foyer; check out the artwork there; and do a bit of stretching before going back into the theatre.

, Some of the answers you might give to being asked how you liked it include:


""It was very festive but I found it hard to understand. Italian isn't my forte.""
""It was interesting in its own way. It could grow on me.""
""Wow! What a mind twister!""
""Brilliant! Say, how hungry are you? I could really dig a crunchy custard at Bertie's right now.""

, If you pay attention, you may find you actually like opera!

Travel frugally.",How to Reduce Entertainment Expenses," Restaurant eating accounted for the largest portion of America's discretionary spending in 2009, eating up $392 billion. Often, a large part of what is spent on food is more about entertainment than to provide appropriate nutrition. Instead of making “going out to dinner” a family activity, make cooking dinner together at home the evening's entertainment. Home cooked food is much less expensive and can be a lot more fun! Some entertaining ways to cook at home include:


Baking and decorating cookies or a cake with younger children. Kids love to ice and decorate cookies and cakes. Buy plenty of sprinkles, colored icings, and small candies and let them go to work.
Teaching older children a family recipe by preparing it together. Many older children are interested in learning how to prepare family favorites, and what better way to learn than by preparing them together?
Making individual or personal pizzas. Using bagels, flour tortillas, French bread, or pizza dough, make a personal size pizza for each family member and allow everyone to top their own pies from a selection of vegetables, cheeses, meats, etc.
Experimenting with new things. For example, if you have always been interested in Indian cuisine, use curry in your cooking. Find new ways to prepare favorite vegetables or test out new recipes. Whatever your passion, explore it with your family by preparing a meal or a snack. You could have each night of the week follow a theme such as Italian night or picnic at home night.;
, Look for inexpensive options in your area such as happy hour or weekly specials. Search online for coupons or special deals such as early-in, early-out specials.


When eating out, one budget conscious approach is to share meals and to have a variety of side dishes rather than more expensive main meals.

, Many cable and satellite subscribers are paying for hundreds of channels they will never watch. Reduce your bill by ensuring that your services are based on how you actually watch television rather than on what you think you'd like to watch (but then don't). You may want to:


Determine what channels you actually watch and switch to the least expensive package your cable or satellite company offers that contains those channels.
Consider a TV antenna, either a roof type or an indoor one that includes an amplifier. Most areas in the country can get ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX and PBS and most of these networks will offer more than one channel. For example, PBS has 3 different channels. Pay TV only carries one.
Shop around. You may be able to find the channels you want for a lower price with another provider. Make some phone calls or check other providers' websites for packages and pricing.
Consider subscribing to a streaming and/or DVD delivery service. Services such as Netflix, Hulu Plus and Blockbuster allow you to stream movies and television shows right to your computer or television and/or receive DVD rentals by mail. If most of the movies and/or the television shows you watch are available, one of these services may be much less expensive than cable or satellite.
Look into watching all of your television online, free of charge. Many networks and cable stations offer free streaming of their most popular shows. Check your favorite station’s websites to determine if the shows you watch are available for streaming.

, Are you paying for a home phone you never use, spending too much on your cell phone bill, or paying for long distance calls? Perhaps it is time for a change. Consider these options:


Disconnecting your home phone. If everyone now has your cell number, you have plenty of minutes to spare each month, and you have not heard your home phone ring in months except from a telephone solicitor, it may be time to cut off the landline and cut out that monthly bill.
Getting rid of your data plan. If you have email and internet service on your phone, you may be paying anywhere from 10 to 50 extra dollars per month for your cell phone service. If you already have Internet and email service at home and/or at work, consider dropping the data plan and saving a chunk of change.
Switching your home phone service to an unlimited long distance plan. Almost all phone companies now offer unlimited long distance plans for a flat monthly rate. Do some comparison shopping and stop paying for your long distance.
Using free internet phone services. Internet phone software such as Skype has made long distance charges and the need for a home phone a thing of the past. These software services allow users to place phone calls to other software users and landlines around the world at little to no cost.

, Consider how you use the internet and determine if there is a less expensive way of meeting your needs. You may be able to shut off your service and use the free WiFi offered by many businesses, do your web browsing at the library, shop around for a better deal, or bundle your service with phone and cable to save money.

, A trip for two to the movies can easily cost upwards of $30. Instead of watching movies in the theater, consider:


Borrowing movies from the library. Many libraries now have VHS and DVD movies available for free––you just need to get a library card. If the library doesn't have a movie you want, you can usually request it.
Using movie rental boxes such as Redbox or Blockbuster. Movie rental boxes are now located in many pharmacies, groceries, and large chain stores and restaurants such as Walmart and McDonalds, and allow you to rent DVDs for just $1 per night. Just make sure you return them on time, since you pay a dollar for each night you keep the movie.
Watching movies on Pay-Per-View. Many cable and satellite companies offer Pay-Per-View channels where you can ‘rent’ movies for 24 - 48 hours for even less than the local video store would charge.
Subscribing to a streaming and/or DVD delivery service such as Netflix or Blockbuster. These services allow you to maintain a list of the DVDs you would like to view, and receive them one or two at a time by mail. The movies have no due date, and you may keep them as long as you like. When you are done viewing them, simply drop them in a pre-paid envelope and mail them back. Services start at as low as $8 a month.
Checking out the specials bin for ex-rentals at your favorite DVD rental store. Many toss out excess DVDs for very low prices within a few months of the DVD title's release––surely you can wait!

, Often a brand new $50 video game is left on the shelf to collect dust within a few weeks after the owner has tired of it. So instead of purchasing video games as soon as they come out, consider only purchasing older, less expensive games, buying your games used at a local video store or website such as eBay, or renting them from a local store or online mail service. Consider using app games instead––these are plentiful, cheaper, and allow for switching allegiances constantly without too much loss of money (and definitely no dust).

, Whether it is college or professional sports, basketball, or football, the big game can almost certainly be viewed from home, a friend’s home, or a local bar or restaurant. Save the money you would drop on tickets and high priced snacks, and watch the game on television. It is probably a good idea though to save your pennies for one special game of the season, so that you're not feeling completely deprived.

, If you drink alcohol, you can save hundreds of dollars by drinking at home instead of at the bar. Even better, if you still love the socializing (and who doesn't), cut down on how much you drink and intersperse all drinks with water, a wake-up latte, and good conversation.

, Most newspapers, news stations, and magazines maintain websites, which contain all of the same content they publish or broadcast. If not, you can read magazines and newspapers at your local library or through your library's online database. Check to see if you can get the information for free online, and cancel the costly subscription if you can.

, There are many ways to entertain your kids for less. Keep in mind that your presence and engagement with your kids is the best gift they could ever have. Expensive toys can never make up for you always being too busy to play with them. Some ideas for cheap or free entertainment include:


Take a trip to the park. Parks and playgrounds are an endless source of free entertainment for young children. Bring a picnic and make it an afternoon.
Visit the library. Not only can you check out great books and videos, but the kids can also all play online at the same time, participate in story time and crafts, and get help with their homework. Libraries offer many programs and activities for children to learn and play. Check with your local library for information on programs it offers.
Bake together. Children, young and old, love to bake and decorate cookies, cakes, and pies. So spend the afternoon or evening in the kitchen snacking!
Make a craft project. Children love to draw, color, paint, cut, and glue. Look online for children’s craft ideas and spend a low cost afternoon making crafts.
Play a board or card game. Children of all ages enjoy board and card games, and many modern games are made so that both children and adults can have fun playing them. Or get out the tablet and play a game on it together.

, You can find quite a bit of low cost entertainment locally, if you know where to look. Check local websites for Information on children's activities in your area. Some things to consider in the way of local entertainment:


Local musicians, comedians, and performers can be seen in parks, concert halls, outdoor theaters, community centers, and bars on almost any night of the week, and they cost less than half of what a concert or Broadway show does.
County fairs and city carnivals offer inexpensive, close-to-home entertainment throughout the summer.
City and community activities such as ice cream socials, free concerts or shows in the park, and covered bridge festivals are offered by many small and large towns. Check your city’s website, or check with City Hall for information on activities offered by your community.
High school college games and events. Many high schools offer admission to games, band concerts, talent shows, and dance performances at little to no cost. Colleges and universities also offer plays, music concerts, and ball game tickets at inexpensive prices.

, Staying with friends, vacationing during the off-season, and visiting low cost locations like developing countries, are all easy ways to save on vacation expenses.

Sell yourself first.,
Join online artist communities.,
Make yourself public.,
Blog about your artwork.,
Create a mailing list.,
Take good pictures.,
Be sure to properly license your art.,
Consider the option of creating your own site.,
Expect this to be a gradual process and don't expect to sell a lot right away.",How to Sell Fine Art Online," Before doing anything else, stop and sum up yourself as an artist. Now, think about how to translate that to an online profile. Be it the few words, Twitter allows you or an entire page of indulgence that your own website would allow you. Bring out the most salient features of your creativity, your experience, your passion, and your reasons for painting. Make it clear to readers why you are an artist who loves art, produces high quality art, and is a true champion of art. If you're not great with words, find a friend who can help you with this really important aspect of selling online – the establishment of your credibility and reliability.;
, Depending on what scale you intend to sell your art pieces, you may want to get an account on an online art community or store, like Deviant Art. With 15% -20 % brokerage, you can also find many online art galleries like Art Brokerage, Diva Art Group, or Saatchi Art that will show your artwork online and sell them to the buyer in completely secured transaction. There are also many other possible sites, such as Etsy (heavier on the crafts but still arty), eBay (auction site), an Amazon store (an online store platform), CafePress (for printing your artwork onto stuff like mugs), Craigslist (general classifieds), and quite a lot of other artwork based sales sites (do a general search).


Read the terms and conditions of every site very carefully. Know what commission or percentage the site takes, know what protections (or lack of them) that the site offers, know what clientele generally peruse the site, know the general sales brought in by the site, know everything you can that is relevant to your sales.
If your goal is to turn your art into an investment property, then selling online is likely to be a much longer path to this end. This is largely because it is generally more difficult for unknown artists to secure higher priced sales with serious collectors online than it is through a traditional gallery where such concrete decisions can be made safely. It is best to see selling art online as an adjunct to your usual methods of selling art, not your only means.

, Get yourself out there as best as you can by advertising yourself. Publish some ""example"" pieces around the web to show what you can do and to demonstrate your style. Be sure to add a watermark to your digital version to protect your artwork from art thieves.


Spend a little time researching online the ways in which other artists are promoting themselves. What works for them and what doesn't? What do you like about their promotional strategies and what do you want to avoid? This type of research can give you a lot of ideas and also alert you to potential pitfalls for the ways in which you will promote your own artwork. Bookmark the sites of artists selling online that really inspire you, so that you can come back to them regularly to see how they're evolving and succeeding.
Seize the power of Twitter and Facebook to increase people's knowledge of you. Tweet updates about your new paintings, your thoughts about art, and news items about art in general. On Facebook, place photos of your artwork, (digitally watermarked), photos of you receiving awards, and information about your art, artwork in general, and perhaps even some critiques of artwork.

, Given the hundreds of free blogging websites, you have a lot of choice in keeping a blog. Most importantly, it's extremely useful to keep it updated regularly - this gives people something ""pretty to look at"", and a story to follow as your reputation increases and your sales story grows. A blog can pick up a lot of hits from search engines if you utilize the keywords feature accurately; use it to your advantage. Be sure to name your blog something simple but memorable – you'll want people to be able to find you with ease.


Read How to start a blog and How to increase website traffic for free for assistance.
A good way to test keywords for very little cost is through using an auction site. Play around with the words you use to title your art sales, as well as the words used within the body of the text. Keep changing the words until you find the sweet spot – words that really do seem to attract the most views.

, This could be your most effective tool if managed well. For every sale you make, every person who sends you an email that might be interested, get all of their email addresses in digital database ready for mass emailing. At designated intervals (once a month, every other week, whenever you start a new series) send them all nice, grammatically correct, friendly emails, complete with a neatly set-out portfolio of the pictures of your recent work (a PDF can work well for this purpose). This keeps you on the radar of past customers, which is important. And if it's a really wonderful newsletter, you might get lucky and they might send it to all of their friends as well – then even more eyes are seeing your work!


Every thoughtful mailing list includes an opt-out option. Don't be threatened by this; see it as good housekeeping and as retaining the clients who really do want to see your items. You're not online to hassle people who aren't interested!

, Like they say, ""a picture's worth a thousand words"" and you'll want your impression on potential customers to be good. Show detail, right down to paint strokes and paint type. Be willing to show potential buyers multiple shots of your work under different light, hung on a wall, etc. This may be the only way to alleviate the justifiable fear many people have of buying a work of art that they have never seen in person.


Bear in mind that not everyone has a good internet connection. Balance great photos with ease of downloading time. Talk to a web specialist if you're not sure what to do.
For more photography tips of relevance, read How to take better product photographs for free and How to take catalog photos.

, Licensing art is a way of proving what belongs to whom. It is a necessary bookkeeping in the arts department and will help you if there is a dispute about originality, ownership, or moral rights.

, Having your own site means that you can optimize every page for search engines and it sets you apart from the many artists who only use general art sales sites. Having your own website means that the viewer is not distracted by other artists and their work whilst browsing your art and your own name is likely to gain in reputation faster. You can sell directly from your site via email correspondence with potential buyers (ask them to contact you for prices, to make a purchase etc.).


If you're serious about selling your art online with your own site, then it's essential with a domain name that is either your own name or the name that you want people to associate you with your art. For example, you could use a domain made up of your first and last name such as firstnamelastname.com or if you work under a pseudonym then you could use a domain name using that i.e. pseudonym.com.
Give serious consideration to making your website as much like a virtual art gallery as possible. Encourage potential clients to wander through and see your paintings in a leisurely, gallery-like manner to increase their viewing enjoyment.
Add prices and contact details. People want to see the price, so don't hide it or expect the customer to come up with one for you. And be available to answer their questions in a timely fashion.
When creating your own website, you need to find a secure method for accepting payment and you might even consider implementing an escrow system. The more expensive your artwork is, the more careful you will need to be about money handling, including acceptance of returns and refunds. There are various methods in existence online for the safe transference of money; do your research to find out what works best for your local needs and for your global market.

, An online art business needs to be built up little by little. It's much the same as putting together a company (indeed, you should treat your online art sales as a business) – you will try to make your name known, or at least give people a hint on who you are as an artist, develop your services as you grow, and gain in reputation as time goes on. It may feel like a long time at the beginning but solid and patient foundations will set you up for a good future, as well as maintaining a positive attitude about what you're doing.


Attend as many relevant art shows to show your work as you can. If the shows are juried, display the awards your art has won as part of your profiles or website backgrounds.

Buy the arts!,
Support the indie artist first.,
Buy real paintings and drawings from living artists to decorate your home.,
Buy books from living authors at full price.,
Buy tickets to music, dance and other live performances.,
Hire live local musicians for your personal events -- weddings, graduation parties, child's bar or bat mitzvahs, Sweet Sixteens, family reunions or get-togethers.,
If you need to buy new clothes, especially for evening or party wear, consider finding a textile artist, tailor, seamstress or other artisan.,

Eat out at small chef-owned original restaurants.,
Buy handmade toys, furnishings, furniture and gifts from local artists.,
Buy locally grown food from farmers and gardeners.",How to Support the Arts1," Don't argue about the price, just look at your budget and decide what you need and want in life. No matter what your income or social class, you have at least some entertainment budget and you have choices in what to get for your necessities. When buying art, you support an artist in his or her pursuit of art, so every little bit counts. The following steps provide practical suggestions for purchases that support the arts.


Both fine art and artisan creations (crafts, chefs and arts that aren't seen as fine art) support the local economy as well as give you a higher quality of lifestyle. You may find you can afford more personal luxury after you know these artists and discover what you like most. They also need to eat, do their laundry, pay their rent and local taxes on everything, so they are also helping everyone else in the area keep their jobs by pouring your spending money into building a stronger community. In all of these things, follow your personal tastes.
Don't buy stuff you don't need or like just to support the arts. Specifically support the artists and artisans whose work you enjoy and collect more of it over the years as they grow artistically. Your collection will deepen as well as broaden and you'll be an important patron to these artists. It's a luxury, so the point is to indulge yourself and get the best of their work.;
, When deciding to go out for a show, consider tickets for live theater instead of a movie or an indie film rather than a first-run blockbuster. You're supporting new actors, directors, producers and live theatrical houses when you make these choices. If a favorite comes along go ahead and get the first run viewing but opt for a matinee to save money so you can also see the indie film. You'll have more variety in your viewing pleasure and your dates may find that you are more educated, sophisticated and intellectual than if you just go to the same movies everyone talks about.

, Collect real art within your budget. If you like artists you can't afford, consider smaller original pieces, sketches rather than paintings or archival limited edition prints. Then take care of your art collection by storing it in a cool, dark, dry place (attic, closet or other air conditioned indoor area).


Frame everything and look up basic art conservation for collectors. If you vary which artists you collect, the entire collection will appreciate in value. You may not know which of your collections will become super valuable by the artist's fame growing, but your kids and grandkids will have an incredible legacy if you spread that investment around -- and do it from the heart.
Buy the artwork you fall in love with. Then stash them if your tastes change because collectors or your kids may love them later.

, Very often discounts and bargains get taken out of the author's royalties. The author gets paid on the net, not on the gross value of the books printed. If it's print-on-demand and you discover independent authors you like, always purchase them direct from the author's website versus Amazon.


If you collect e-books from living authors, you won't need as many bookcases.
Don't feel bad about purchasing hardcover versions of paperbacks or e-books you liked and want to reread, that's a way to reduce your bookshelves to manageable.

, Again, do this within budget and focus it on your tastes. You may like Riverdance more than you like formal ballet, or you may prefer live theater off-off-Broadway types of productions. You may like concerts with big famous bands or symphony orchestras or opera. Yes, this includes live theatre as mentioned above or any type of performance art you enjoy.


Pay full price tickets to magicians and musicians.
When you pass a street performer, put some money into the performer's hat or tip box.
Buy CDs of independent musicians who self produce them, you may be launching a someday-famous band and have a collectible -- or just have a beloved CD of famous music. And if you download their music, pay for it––don't be a freeloader as the ""free music"" attitude has ruined the livelihood of many a struggling yet very talented musician.
Be polite and quiet during live performances. This is especially important in pubs that have Celtic music, as the Celtic tradition is very keen on respect for bards. Don't talk during live performances. You're not only distracting the audience who'd like to hear the music, you may be distracting the musicians too and throwing them off their stride.

, Why not celebrate your anniversary by hiring a live musician to serenade your spouse at a romantic dinner -- or have a romantic dinner at home with a musician performing that you both love? Any kind of holiday or personal event can become lavish if you have live music. Book them well in advance, talk to them in person after a concert and find out their rates.


Find out when the band's off season is and what causes it. You may wind up getting a bargain or a shorter wait time if you book them during a time of year they don't get many gigs. The opposite of tourist season is often good.
For the holidays, try to book the band early, so you're the one that gets them for your holiday party.
If you like variety, turn your annual music party into a ""guess what the band is"" event.

, Instead of going to an upscale shop where you'll pay a high price for fancy clothing, go to an artist who will fit it to your individual body much better, create it to suit your precise looks, complexion, style and taste, and support another type of independent artist. You will get more than your money's worth because a quality handmade original garment will last longer and if you pay for their best work, wear better than anything from even an expensive store. You can reduce the size of your wardrobe while raising its quality.


Buy handmade boots and shoes from leather crafters and artists. Again, they will be expensive but they'll fit better, look better and wear much longer than shoes and boots from stores.
If you like buying shoes often, find your favorite artisan and have new ones designed for you periodically for fun. You might start getting a ""regular customer"" discount working one on one with the artist instead of just purchasing something made by mass production to sell to thousands of others. Remember, your shoes are unique, unlike anyone else's. If they were made to fit your Christmas dress and you love them, maybe take them to your clothing designer next year to get a new Christmas dress inspired by the shoes. Artists sometimes work together on things like that. The more you know them, the more personal and unique their works are and the closer they come to your personal tastes.

, On a low budget, start with small silver and semiprecious stones. Once you're up in a fine jewelry bracket, you can pay for more elaborate workmanship and more expensive materials. Especially pay attention to their original pieces or commission original pieces. Buying the stock rings and necklaces they have on hand helps the artists to survive, but when you choose their best work or commission something unique that takes the best of their skills, you also feed their souls.

, Food is an art form, so is ambiance, these one-of-a-kind restaurants are sometimes a lot higher quality than chain restaurants. Once you find your favorites, you're likely to get personal attention and extra good service for a more enjoyable experience.

, No matter what it is, if a local artist makes it, you are getting originality and personal attention. Your entire home can become a collection of treasured, unique, beautiful objects. Many of those things will be higher quality than manufactured goods.

, Hire local landscapers to take care of your yard, unless you're a gardener. Find the ones who are artists, look at their other gardens, then give them some artistic freedom. Yes, the flowers in your yard and the landscaping can be artwork that is an expression of who you are and what you love.

Understand what a stage name can do for you.,
Choose a name that reflects your persona.,
Have a story behind your name.,
Do research about your name.,
Choose a searchable name.,
Choose a name that will grow with you.",How to Pick a Stage Name1," A stage name can help you accomplish a number of things, which all can influence how you decide on your name.



Branding: A stage name can help you brand your performance persona, giving you a separate identity to develop as a brand.

Separation of personal and professional life: A stage name will be a very public name, possibly a household name. While some people might still know your real name, keeping your real name separate from your stage name can afford you some level of privacy.

Differentiation: If your real name is very common, a stage name can help you stand out and be more memorable.

Prejudice considerations: Some people have used stage names in the past in order to decrease immediate reactions of racism, anti-Semitism or other forms of prejudice. Luckily, this is less often the case today. Similarly, some women may have avoided a hyphenated name because it might indicate they’re married, which unfortunately some consider to be detrimental to their careers.;
, Your stage name is a way to express yourself. What do you want your name to signify? Think about how a stage name might be able to channel your performance persona., Whatever your stage name, people will likely want to know how you decided to call yourself that. If it’s an uninteresting story, then perhaps think about making up a more exciting story to go with your name., Look online and in name books to learn the meaning of the name you’ve chosen. Learn the history of the name. Does the name’s meaning and history reflect what you want it to mean?

, Think about how people can find your name through search engines like Google. If you use very common words, especially single words like Trouble or Heart, it may be hard for fans to find you online., There can be the appeal of choosing a name that reflects the moment, where you might follow a fad. Also consider where you want to be in 10 or 20 years. Does your stage name suit an older performer just as well as a younger one?


Child performers should consider how their names will grow with them as they get older. Joe Yule called himself Mickey Rooney, a good name for a kid actor. But it was less useful as an adult actor. Similarly Lil’ Bow Wow had to drop “Lil” when he grew up.Choose a name that you won’t get tired of quickly. If you think you might hate your stage name in six months, think of a different moniker.

When buying art, choose an artist you enjoy (of any kind, performance or tangible) and then keep your description of your commission simple.",How to Support the Arts2," Stick to the type of work that's their specialty.


Don't haggle over changes, give them a hard time or get too controlling. Part of supporting the arts is to encourage the artist to go on being an artist. You're not buying real arts in order to get the cheapest bargain or rip off the painter for a masterpiece by paying less than he did for the materials! If you do that, there's a good chance the artist will get disgusted, quit and do something else for a living, which reduces the appreciation of that masterpiece.

"
"
If you bought from a writer, an artist or a musician, review the item on Amazon, Twitter and other places online, especially if you like it.",How to Support the Arts3," Negative reviews are a warning not to buy from an unreliable seller. The arts are far more personal, your taste comes into it. If you made a mistake and got a book you didn't like, explain what you didn't like in a way that people who would like it for what it is will find it enjoyable.


Try something like, ""I expected this to be a lovely vampire romance and it turned out to be a horror novel with a fanged stalker who scared me to death. Don't buy this book if you want to mush over the vampire. But if you like a good scare, it might be just your thing."" You have not only supported the writer (or artist or musician, etc.) by purchasing their original work, you've supported them again by word of mouth so they can sell more, make a living, pay taxes in your town, etc.

"
"
Support the arts in your local area.,
As you know practice makes perfect, so keep practicing and cultivating regularly.",How to Support the Arts4," Youth theatres, amateur organizations and school productions need your support! There are hundreds of ways to get involved, whether you're designing posters, sewing costumes or selling tickets.


Organize and help set up at festivals and fairs. Just helping a bunch of artists and crafters get their stuff unpacked and set up, or helping to organize an event that they can all show up to helps them big time!
Help promote local arts events by posting about them online, blogging them, making flyers or stapling flyers up.
If your town or city has an arts committee, find out what they need volunteers for. If it doesn't, consider trying to form one.
Some types of local events you can help organize or prepare for are concerts, live performances including outdoor ones, art fairs, studio tours for artists, book signings and poetry readings, any of the arts can benefit from a public event and its exposure. If the artists have any recordings or physical things to sell, be sure the event's rules allow them to sell their works even if the performance or show is free.

, Be sincere.


Take classes in humanities or art, music or literature appreciation at your local community college. Some local community charges have a much lower ""audit"" fee if you attend the class but don't take the tests, get a grade or college credit for it. When you're attending just to improve your appreciation of the arts, auditing is just as good as taking the class to get in the right number of Humanities credits and leaves you more in your budget to buy real art, pay local musicians, get tickets, etc.

Get involved!,
Do some reading.,
Go to a museum or art gallery.,
Donate to charities who support the arts or donate to organizations directly.,
Get out there and experience it!,
Get to know the artists.",How to Support the Arts5," The arts are about creativity and self-expression, so whatever your passion, get out there and enjoy the art. Arts are broad, including drawing, painting, performing, street theater, making murals, crafting, engaging the community in artistic projects and much more, so there are plenty of things to explore and find your own artistic niche within.


If you haven't yet discovered the activity that's for you, find out about free or cheap tester classes you can join. Ask if you can borrow materials initially, or look online for many cheap options such as auctions of art materials people no longer need.

, Go to your local library and find books on photography, art, ballet or even the art of performance.


Read up on these arts online, whatever your particular interests are. There are many reviews and articles on all of the arts available for free. That frees your budget to make knowledgeable purchases from local artists.

, Find an art, ballet, photo or performance museum. If you can't go in person, see online exhibits if they are available.


When on vacation, visit museums and galleries in your vacation area. You'll broaden your appreciation of your favorite arts and appreciate your local artists' works even more by deepening your knowledge. You're on vacation anyway, so why not see what artists and musicians, etc., are producing in the cool place you visited? If you take vacations in the same place every year as some people enjoy doing, you can become an annual regular and support particular artists -- the local painter in your holiday spot, the little pub that always has good Celtic music, that theatre, the opera house.
If you like opera, definitely get at least bargain tickets and experience it live. Opera houses operate on a shoestring despite the number of millionaires that donate. They need to sell those empty cheap student seats at the back and it's a wonderful experience. The productions cost so much and involve so many live people not only performing but doing all the work of creating the production that they're always operating at a brutal budget. If you're an opera lover who lives near an opera house, consider volunteering your time and effort to help keep the house going.

, For example, the National Endowment for the Arts, who help art programs throughout America. Donate to art programs You can donate to programs in your school or city.


Organize a monthly art hop. Sign up various art venues in your area that will open their doors on one evening per month. A map and list could be offered in advance to help those planning their tours. Finger foods and beverages could be served at each spot.
Donate directly to local theatres, performance companies and arts events. Many of them accept donations. Your local arts council and local theatre troupe may need the donations more than something as big as the National Endowment for the Arts.
Support PBS. Make a steady annual donation or watch when their pledge drive auctions and bid on things you want. Volunteer to work the phones at PBS pledge drives. PBS always needs it, everywhere, and doing this will also get more of your favorite programming purchased by your local PBS station. They listen to fan requests.
Purchase new copies of your favorite books at full price from living authors and donate them to your local library. The community will be better for it, those that can't afford it will get to read it sooner, those that might never have found your favorite author may wind up buying their own copy when they have to return it. Everyone wins, and your author is more likely to continue writing instead of taking up something else because the bills need to be paid.

, The only way to boost your appreciation and support of the arts is to experience as many performances as possible. Be open-minded and you never know which new genres you will discover.


To save money, opt for cheaper seats or buy last-minute tickets from discount websites.
If you can't afford original paintings from your favorite painters, consider their smaller works, sketches or limited edition prints. Whether you opt for lower priced works from the newest indie unknowns or the lower priced works by more successful artists, you will always be supporting the arts -- and that supports the economy both local and national.

, All of the arts are about communication. Forming relationships with artists and artisans, studying art appreciation and encouraging those that are growing in their arts also improves the quality of your own life. From furnishings and objects that you enjoy more than mass produced goods, to the social success of becoming more refined and knowledgeable to the inner spiritual growth that comes from awareness of beauty, supporting the arts will enrich your life in more ways than you would expect.

Use a childhood nickname.,
Use your middle name.,
Use your family tree as inspiration.,
Use your last name.,
Choose the same last name as your parent’s stage last name.",How to Pick a Stage Name2," You may have been called something other than your real name throughout childhood, and this nickname might be useful as a stage name. For example, Richard Melville Hall was nicknamed Moby by his parents, and he uses this as his stage name., Go with a singular name that is just your middle name, such as the rapper Drake, whose real name is Aubrey Drake Graham.Similarly, Angelina Jolie Voight dropped her last name, moving her middle name to the surname position.

, Use your great-grandmother’s first name or your great-uncle’s middle name. This can help you retain a connection to your family with your stage name., Some performers use just their last name, dropping their first name because it is hard to pronounce or they’ve always disliked their name. Liberace, for example, dropped his first name, Wladziu, and just went by one name.


Some performers may have started their careers with their full names – or with a stage first and last name. Reinventing your career may involve reinventing your name, but you might still want to hang onto some of the reputation or recognition that you already have. Drop your last name from your stage name and go with just a single name.
Alternately, add your last name. If you’ve been using a single name, consider adding a last name to reinvent yourself.
You might also change or alter your last name. Some performers add last names (with or without a hyphen), such as Courtney Cox adding Arquette to her last name when she got married (she dropped Arquette when the marriage ended).

, If you have performers in your family, you may want to link your stage name with their stage names. These can help you gain a reputation and recognition among fans and employers.


For example, Carlos Irwin Estévez became Charlie Sheen in order to match his last name to his actor father Martin Sheen, whose real name is Ramón Antonio Gerardo Estévez. Another son, Emilio, kept the family last name.

Consider changing the spelling of your name.,
Avoid symbols in your name.,
Add an exotic element.,
Consider how people will pronounce your name.,
Consider your international profile.,
Be consistent with spelling and formatting.",How to Pick a Stage Name3," If you have a name that you like, you might fiddle with the spelling to see if alternate letters will make it more interesting. The band Gotye, pronounced “Go-tee-ay,” is a respelling of the French surname Gaultier.Sometimes this isn’t a good idea, especially if you’re adding an extra letter where it is really unnecessary. You might just risk confusing people and making it difficult to pronounce your name.

, While it may be a hot thing to replace an S in your name with a $ or an I with a !, these just add confusion and likely mistakes in spelling your name. Even though Ke$ha and others have done it, you should skip this.


The singer Prince changed his name to a symbol in order to get out of his contract with Warner Bros. in 1993. Since the symbol was unpronounceable, he was called The Artist Formerly Known as Prince. This really only works if you already have a well-established reputation and fan following, and ultimately would make things too complicated anyway. Prince reverted to being called Prince after his contract with Warner Bros. expired., Some stage names may benefit from exoticizing them. This happens frequently for burlesque and pinup performers. Adding words such as “von,” “de,” or “la” can make your name more exotic or exciting., If you have a very unique name, you may find that people have a lot of trouble pronouncing it. Think about actors Quvenzhané Wallis, Saoirse Ronan or Ralph Fiennes. These are difficult names to pronounce and often require pronunciation guides in news articles. Think of alternative spellings of your name that will facilitate people pronouncing it correctly.
Once you are well-known, however, you will likely overcome this problem.

, Will your name travel well with you if you start performing overseas? Since the internet has enabled fans from all over the world to connect with performers, think about how your name resonates with different cultures around the world.

, If you do choose to use alternative spelling or unique formatting of your name, keep it consistent. Do not fluctuate between using an S and a $. Choose one and stick to it.

Try out your name.,
Don’t legally change your name.,
Register your stage name with a trade guild or union.,
Update your bank account information.,
Reserve social media accounts with your stage name.,
Reserve a website domain.",How to Pick a Stage Name4," Your name might sound great to you when you say it out loud in your bedroom. Find out how it sounds when someone else is announcing you. Think of this as market testing your name , Unless you are completely abandoning your real name altogether, there is no need to legally change your name. This will help you maintain a distinction between your personal and professional lives.

, If you are currently a member of a trade guild, such as the Screen Actors Guild or the American Federation of Musicians, you should update your membership information with your stage name. It’s best to ensure that no one else in your guild has the same name as you.If you are not yet part of a union or guild, you may consider joining one sometime in the future. In this case, keep in mind that you should probably register with your real name and stage name in one membership.

, You may want to include your stage name on your bank account. This is especially true if you have a business bank account and you are earning money under your stage name. Be sure that the account has both of your names listed to avoid confusion.

, Once you’ve chosen your stage name, make sure you have an online presence with that name. Start a Facebook page that isn’t your personal account. Figure out a Twitter ID and start an account., Once you’ve chosen your stage name, reserve a website domain with your name. It’s a good idea to reserve a domain name to avoid someone misusing your name or capitalizing on your success for their own gain (known as “cybersquatting”).Search a domain name registrar such as GoDaddy.com or Dotster.com to make sure your domain name isn’t already taken.
Register your web name with a name registrar. Choose the length of time you want to reserve the domain name. You can reserve it in year increments for up to 10 years. You will need to pay a fee, which can fluctuate by registrar and by year to year. Typically, these run $10 to $15 for the initial registration."

Understand the process of relief printing.,
Examine the rim of the print.,
Look for signs of embossing.,
Look for signs of cutting in the cross-hatching or shaded areas.",How to Identify Prints1," Relief printing is the oldest and most traditional printing technology, and involves reproducing images at its most basic. In relief printing, a wood or metal relief block is carved by cutting away the areas of the picture that will not be printed, then ink is applied to the raised areas either by dabbing the areas to be printed, or rolling the ink on. The final stage of the process involves transferring the ink to the page by laying a sheet of paper and applying pressure. Examples of relief prints include:


Wood block printing
Linocut
Type-set;
, One of the quickest and most reliable ways of identifying relief prints is to examine the edges of the print for evidence. The process by which ink is transferred from the block via pressure will produce a characteristic rim around the edges of life. This is a feature that is only characterized by relief printing processes, so it's always a sure sign.For comparison purposes, examine the serial number on any bill of US currency. You should notice the rim of the numbers is slightly darker than the inside. This is a sign of relief printing. Look for this tendency in the piece that you're examining., Another fairly reliable way of identifying relief printing is to look at the back of the piece for signs of embossing, another result of the transfer process in relief printing. Examine the page and feel with your hands for signs of raised perforation and pressure, signifiers of the paper being pressed on the relief block.


Compared with intaglio printing, the pressure required to make relief prints is relatively minor, meaning that embossing will sometimes be difficult to see and differentiate from that of intaglio printing, which is more severe.
Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) is often used to highlight and document the physical signifiers of embossing in relief printing., While it might seem obvious, one of the best ways of distinguishing relief from intaglio printing is in examining the black marks as closely as possible and trying to decide whether it looks like they were raised, or the white marks were raised on the original block. This is part intuition and part experience, but one of the best places to look is in shaded or cross-hatched areas.


On relief prints, you should be able to see that shading is made by cutting out little wedges between short lines, then cutting a long line at right-angles, leaving smooth outside lines.

Understand the process of intaglio printing.,
Look for plate marks.,
Look for raised ink.,
Look for varying intensity of color in single lines.,
Look at the shape of the line.,
Study more intaglio techniques.",How to Identify Prints2," Intaglio is Italian for ""incis­ing,"" and correspondingly revolves around a process of applying ink into the grooves or etches or engravings, then using a lot of pressure to transfer that ink from the indents onto the page. This usually results in slightly crisper, more substantial lines that you can learn to identify. The process was developed in the 1500s. Engraving and etching are both styles of intaglio printing, with slightly different techniques and signifiers.Engraving is typically done on copper plates, using a burin, a v-shaped cutting tool, to remove slivers of metal from the surface of the plate. The shape of engraved lines are typically quite clean, and pointed at each end, where the lines will swell or shrink.

Etching is done using acid to draw freely over wax placed on the copper plating, using a needle. Etched lines will have a blunter end than engraved lines, and you should be able to see signs of the wax in unevenness and crumbling at the edge of the lines. In general, etched lines are less precise.

, Because lots of pressure is used to transfer the ink, the metal printing plate will leave an impression in the paper on intaglio prints. The corners of these marks should be rounded, since sharped edges would rip the paper, and the edges will often retain traces of ink that wasn't completely wiped off the plate during the printing process. Plate marks are always signifiers of intaglio printing, whether engravings or etchings.


If you don't see a plate mark, that isn't necessarily the sign that it isn't an intaglio print. It won't show up on every intaglio if the plate was wiped off completely.

, Because of the way the printing process works, the strongest and darkest lines should be raised when compared with the surrounding areas, because it will take more pressure and more ink to make the darker line pop out. This is one of the most reliable signifiers of intaglio printing, etched or engraved.

, In intaglio printing, the lines will have varying levels of intensity in terms of the ink displacement, compared to relief printing, which should be relatively uniform. This is because the depth of the grooves can be adjusted, resulting in darker or lighter printed lines, accordingly, in the same line.


Look along longer lines to see whether or not they become darker in the interior. If so, it's almost surely a sign of intaglio printing.

, Engraved lines will flow smoothly, swelling some before tapering to a point, while etched lines lines will have shakier, round edges. Often, intaglio prints will involve bits of both types of printing, as is found on US currency, in the printed pictures on the front and back.

, There are lots of subcategories of intaglio printing that will display particulars of the process, so you can narrow your identification skills even more specifically. Other intaglio techniques include:


Aquatint
Mezzotint
Steel Engraving
Stipple Engraving

Understand the different varieties of lithography.,
Magnify the image.,
Look for the absence of plate marks.,
Look for the flatness of the ink.,
Look for the illusion of shade, created by multiple layers.,
Look for blurriness.",How to Identify Prints3," Lithography is a big term often used to refer to many different styles of printing, contemporary and classical. But, in pre-photographic terms, planographic lithography is that which is printed from a flat surface. In planographic printing, plates are prepared by laying down an image in a greasy or oily substance, typically called tusche, that will hold ink. The blank areas of the plate will then be washed off with water, removing the ink from those areas. Types of planographic lithography include:


Chalk-manner prints, which are made by using wax crayon to draw the image onto limestone.
Chromolithography, which are identifiable based on the stippling of multiple colors on the plate.
Tinted lithography is made via two plates, one of which uses broad individual background strokes of tinting to give the image background color.
Transfer lithography isn't transferred directly from stone to paper, but from transfer paper to the stone itself, meaning that the image needn't be drawn in reverse originally.

, Unlike some of the other varieties of pre-photographic print identification, planographic lithography needs to be examined using at least 10x magnification to notice the signifiers necessary for proper identification. Since the absence of intaglio and relief printing marks doesn't necessarily mean you're dealing with a lithograph, it's important to look closely at the images and not take absence for proof.

, If you find plate marks, you're always dealing with a relief or, more likely, an intaglio print. Because the image is taken directly from a flat stone, there will never be plate marks of the sort you'd find on those prints, on a lithograph.

, Upon close examination, you should notice that there is no difference in the depth of the ink and the blank paper. Everything should be on the same level, with no imprinting of whiteness or darkness. Noticing this will require serious magnification, but it's a good indication that you're dealing with some variety of planographic printing, since the ink has come from a flat surface that didn't imprint itself in the paper.

, Since the planographic surface holds and repels ink on the same level, tonal variation is created by varying the amount of surface area covered and not covered by varying the quantity of ink deposited on the paper, either by using multiple layers and multiple prints, or by applying areas of heavier wax on the stone.


Usually, shaded areas will be spotty, shooting almost stipple-like dots that have the same tonal value. One mark will not be lighter or darker than the other surrounding marks, nor should they be evenly spaced. This creates the ""illusion of shade.""
A print with multiple colors will overlap those colors in certain areas. In general, you won't find green, but overlapping areas of blue and yellow, a more efficient process of printing. Shade in color prints is typically made via variation of tone., Typically, fine details will be somewhat blurrier in transfer lithographs than in other types of printmaking. Often, the paper won't quite stick, or will otherwise shift around when pressure is applied to the paper, and the details tend to suffer when this happens. This is typically a sign of planographic lithography processes."
